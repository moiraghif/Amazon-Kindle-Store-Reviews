# TO DO List:

- [ ] Download data
- [ ] Storing them on MongoDB (?) or other system that permits parallel computing on `.json` files
- [ ] Make a pipeline to process them:
  - [ ] Tokenization
  - [ ] Normalization
  - [ ] Compute weights
- [ ] Store weights on HBase
- [ ] Try some ML models (Neural Networks to do it with a stream, or other parallel systems)
- [ ] Enjoying results before using some REAL model
- [ ] Roby will use RoBERTa to humiliate us :'(
