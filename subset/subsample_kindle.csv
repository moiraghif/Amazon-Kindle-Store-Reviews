5	'Amazing story collection.  This is by far one of my favorite books.'
5	'I throughly enjoyed this trilogy and look forward to rereading it in a few years. Old age forgetfulness is a bitch. These books are the type that got me hooked on military  science fiction in the first place\n I highly recommend them not only for science fiction fanatics but for anyone who enjoys any type of fiction.'
5	'These stories are wonderful. I love both characters and their boyfriends, and the Mexican characters too. Love that they show up again, like old friends!'
5	'Bruce offered free copies of his book on one of the LinkedIn forums I subscribe to, so I downloaded it, not expecting a lot--thinking it\'d be the same sort of packaged business advice or self-help material that\'s so common on the Web. I was wrong. It\'s a great book, from someone who\'s dedicated to helping others be their best. (And you can tell he has a heart for that.)\n\nThe writing is down to earth, full of examples and personal stories. It\'s practical, with good advice that had me building to-do lists in my mind as I read chapters. And it\'s inspirational, because it leaves you wanting to be a better person and to help others. It leaves you wanting more, too. When I finished the 95 or so pages, some of which are illustrations, I felt like, "Where\'s the rest of it?"\n\nSo it\'s definitely worth reading. If you\'re on LinkedIn or Google+ or Facebook or some other social media and you wonder why your results are so small when compared to the huge amount of time you\'ve invested, you may well find your answer here.'
1	"This bio is not even worth a star!  Worst $2.99 I've ever spent.  A 6th grade book report would be worth the $2.99 I spent and the time I spent reading this crap!!  SO..... NOT WORTH WASTING YOUR TIME & MONEY ON!!!"
5	"It's not very often that friends can put the strain shown in this book on your friendship and not expect that friendship to break but maybe with a lot of hard work and the ability to forgive you are able to put the pieces back together."
5	"Wow this was another great book I can't wait for more I hope it's really soon .....It was funny and exciting to find out if they finally got together and they did ..."
5	"I got it hesitantly as a sample first. I got hooked and I really loved it. I could not stop reading it and ended up not sleeping much, I had to finish it!\nGreat romance, very hot sexy times, adventure ... some rough moments, it makes it believable. The book is great fun, highly recommended\nI can't wait to read another one :-)"
5	'Very insitefull on how casinos work.'
5	'great book by the lesser known bronte sister, its still a really good read and quite profound and moving'
3	'Good read'
4	"It's one of those books that you know the ending before you even start reading the book.  It's more about what's in the middle.  I liked this book.  Predictable, yes but still a fun read!"
5	"Excellent read, I didn't want to put it down!"
5	'Finally a positive outlook on this illness...This book clearly explained the issues faced by those with bipolar as well as those of the family and friends that love them. Reading this made me feel supported, not alone, in trying to support my bipolar family member who has also read and appreciated this book. This psychiatrist has spent years working in the bipolar field and I highly recommend this book.'

5	'Almost half the year has gone by and I can honestly say that RUSH by Eve Silver might end up near the top of my YA reads of 2013. This is my first Eve Silver book and it also happens to be her debut YA novel. I opened this book with high expectations and I wasn\'t disappointed at all. RUSH promises mystery, adventure, romance and aliens. What more can you ask of a YA science fiction novel?\n\nI hope I didn\'t lose any of you when I said aliens or science fiction because this isn\'t your typical sci-fi. On the contrary, I think it offers a refreshing view of out of this world beings that have come to Earth, some in peace and others with the single goal of annihilating the planet and its inhabitants. Imagine living out your normal life and with one heroic act, you\'re suddenly sucked into a parallel world where you\'re fighting alien forces that are trying to destroy Earth. This is exactly what happened to Miki Jones and now she\'s going about her everyday life where she can be sucked into this parallel universe to battle it out against the destructive Drau, without any warning. She\'s accompanied by other teenagers like her, including a long lost friend, Luka, and the mysterious new guy at school, Jackson. Some on her team call it a game, while other are just going through the motions trying not to get killed. And if it really can be called a game, it\'s definitively a deadly one, because no one is safe. Not even the seasoned warriors on the team.\n\nMiki is a very inquisitive character. She wants to know everything about the game and why she was chosen. But most of all, she just wants to know what\'s really going on. She doesn\'t understand the game, except she knows she has to fight to stay alive. As the book progresses, she learns to ask the right questions and other team members become more inclined to answer her truthfully. Not only do we learn more about the deadly game, but we also learn more about the Drau and Miki\'s background. I found it very easy to relate to Miki since she seems like a tangible and realistic girl. Even thought she shows courage and strength, her doubts and fears make her a realistic character since not all characters should be all fierce and powerful.\n\nAs for Jackson, I had a love/hate relationship with him in the beginning. With his constant wear of sunglasses and his cocky attitude, I didn\'t like him as Miki\'s love interest at first. He warned Miki herself multiple times that his intentions were not pure and that she should stay away because he isn\'t a good guy. However, because of his charisma and his competency in the game, Miki starts to rely a lot on him, especially to get the answers that she needs to satisfy her inquisitive mind. At first, I much preferred Luka over Jackson but it\'s almost as if the author herself gave up on Luka and fell for Jackson\'s bad boy attitude. Luka became a boring character and I\'ll probably end up not remembering who he is when the sequel come out. Overall, the romance in the story isn\'t too overbearing, which is a nice change since it lets us readers concentrate on the story a little bit more.\n\nThere are just a few things in RUSH that I wasn\'t too crazy about. First off, the fact the Miki only learns a few things at a time about anything involving the game was simply annoying. Obviously Jackson knows everything but it\'s almost as if he likes having Miki beg for answers. Miki\'s best friend, Carly, was simply a bitch that got pissed at her for the slightest things. She\'s just a boy crazy girl that I would feel embarrassed to call a best friend. And finally, that awful cliffhanger definitively leaves you wanting more but I feel like it\'s been done before. The book could have had a better ending than this horrible and stereotypical way Eve Silver left us hanging.\n\nI\'m not necessarily a gamer but I like to play video games from time to time. The fact that the points system in the "game" is very similar to those in video games makes it easier for the characters to aim for a goal and to actually survive. The video game references (and comic book/manga references too) makes this book a good one to recommend to boyfriends, young-at-heart husbands and guy friends in general. Even if the main character is female, I\'m sure many guys will end up enjoying RUSH. It\'s had some mixed reviews so the book is obviously not for everyone, but I personally enjoyed it. It\'s an edgy, original and striking first book to a series.'
5	'Fantastic story. I truly did not want it to end.'
5	'I grew up with horses, and when I was young, "Black Beauty" was still one of those books that everyone was recommending to horse lovers.  So when I picked up Jumping Into Danger, I was looking forward to a horse book that gave the feel of the horse.  I was not disappointed.\n\nI particularly like how the author describes the horses moving.  One is described as moving "like milkweed floss beside the heavier Rebel" which is a perfect description of how a horse just floats through the air when confident in taking jumps, and an excellent comparison in the way two horses move.  The author\'s background shows in this book, and she really captures the excitement of meeting a new horse.\n\nThe story has a balance of fun and mystery, which builds.  And, like your typical kids, the main characters embark on an exploration fit for Nancy Drew (another childhood favorite).  It also moves fast, giving a thrilling experience.  I also really loved seeing the interpersonal relations, and especially Jessica\'s sharing of her horse.  This book teaches great sportsmanship, a perfect thing for a son or daughter to read since the lessons are so natural.\n\nThere was one scene that I want to particularly highlight, which got me a bit teary-eyed.  The author does a very good job of depicting a horse that has suffered abuse, and I applaud her for this, because it is a very real issue that needs looking at.  This abused horse has been rescued and is being cared for at a farm, in the story, and the main character assists in helping Star (the horse) adjust to her new, safe, life.  I won\'t spoil it by saying just how, but it had my tearing and grinning like a twelve yearold.\n\nI really loved the ending too.  She really tied this up neatly.  I was on the edge of my seat for the end, straining forward like a racehorse myself.\n\nAs with any book out there, I did come across a few typos, but these were extremely minor, and it did not kick in until I was several pages past them, and typos are something that cause a lot of hangups for me when reading.  So it really speaks for the storyline that I was able to read over them without any mental bumps.  The story flows that smoothly.\n\nNeedless to say, I loved this book.  So if you are looking for a good short read, this might be what you are looking for.  It\'s got meat, it\'s got flair, and you can read it in a day if you don\'t have too many interruptions (I started over again, just to be able to time it).'
5	'Once again Scott M. Schafer seems to have his finger on the pulse of Christiandom and has presented a much need book discussing the ministry of authority.  "Receiving Authority" studies various aspects of authority including what it is and is not and how it relates to the individual.  Though not a complete discussion, there is enough information within these pages to facilitate an in-depth personal bible study as well as a small group study plan.\nAuthority cannot be discussed without an understanding of lawlessness (also known as sin) and power; which is often confused with authority. In the book "Receiving Authority" Scott M. Schafer reveals how these two behaviors have been mainstreamed into individual lives thereby hindering the believers\' authority.\nHe writes: "We are largely inundated with negativity about abusive authority in both the church and in contemporary culture."  By revealing lawlessness and the abuse of power the reader will be able to see why authority has been ineffective and how it is to be applied God\'s way.\nI received a PDF copy of the book and it was 62 pages total, a quick read except it is important for the reader to carefully review the bible verses mentioned.  Mr. Schafer\'s\' books point the individual in the right direction  and it is very necessary for each person to seek the scriptures for themselves.  There are a total of nine chapters and I would recommend you spend a day on each one.  The chapters are: 1) The Nature of God 2) The Authority of Jesus Christ 3)Discipleship and Authority 4) Characteristics of True Authority 6) Prophecy and Authority Today 7) Authority: The Fruit of Worship 8) Higher Levels and the Ways of God 9) Authority and the Last Days. As you can see I have barely discussed the extent of this book, both prophecy and worship are in terms of authority are excellent studies by themselves.\n\nThis is a book I recommend you purchase and read it not just for personal growth but for small group bible study as well.  Marsha L. Randolph'
4	'Shiva is written in story format which makes it easy for the reader to comprehend the contents much easier.  The story opens by saying, "an eight year old boy, lived with his parents in Mayawanti. Every night before going to bed he saw an image of a precious stone circle around his eyes and disappears."\n\nThen one night Shiva had dreamed with a handsome monk and when he reveals his dream to his parents and friends they thought he was crazy. This monk has the boy close his eye during his visit in the dream, and did not reveal a path that Shiva is to take on a journey.\nSri tells lessons and lesson number one is "Gods strength does not lie in His thoughts." Sri says that the thinking mind tries to create a conflict in thoughts but the loving spirit finds way to reconcile the current situation. We need to find the glory in the "one thing" and stay true to that "one thing." Oh how I would love to find my one thing, my purpose in my own life!\n\nSri explains how the mind works and how it is a "tool" to be used for good and we each have the chance to do good or evil with our minds. Yes, our thoughts. This reminds me of a lot of the law of attraction as he writes because he makes you see that all is universal. If you believe in the law of attraction than this writing is not so hard to understand but if you do not believe in the law of attraction then you will have a hard time understanding the meaning behind what the writer is saying.'
5	"Excellent.  Kept my attention throughout the series.  I'm sure like most readers, I want to read more about Seth and Sara."
5	'Elizabeth Peters has done for realistic Egyptian mysteries. Dhanesh Kumar M has for intriguing Indian Mysteries. With the rich culture and heritage, and brains to match, will Krish and Susan solve it, in time? Great book to curl up with, and may even enlighten you along the way. I would recommend this book.'
3	'This book was like reading some type of cult. This was not normal reading genre. Tia and Michael were the satanic twins that held the key to this great corruption. Their sole aim was to bring Britains surrender to a German dominated European Union. After two failed world wars, Germany would not be denied a third time. Magus Santar and his followers would turn Europe into a fortress to spread terror across the globe until Satan regained the earth and was once again the Lord of this World. While this book had a lot of hot sex scenes in it I felt that it was too long at times. What I did like about this book was that it was well written with no errors in grammar or spelling this was my first time reading this author and I hope to read more from him.'
4	"This offering by Mr. Ajayi is an outstanding prequel to his upcoming work. The meticulous time taken to enlighten the reader into the past lives & internal struggles of the book's characters, especially Samantha & Tumaini. Part of me looks forward to an equally intrusive glance into the other Champions. The generally cryptic, yet spiritually hopeful nature of Priest's words towards the Champions maintained my curiosity throughout the book, and it allowed be to remain cognizant about the overarching theme of Christ's overwhelming glory, which was referenced in multiple places in the text. I LOVED the fact that these heroes actually USED their superpowers with decent consistency, rather than bottle them up in some useless quest to understand them first (or something like that. The thorough descriptiveness of the action kept me on my toes, wonder what was next. All in all, it's a strong start to a potentially groundbreaking series in faith-based fiction. It's an absolute MUST-BUY BOOK!"
5	"This new author is wonderful.  For a first time author she is already one of the best I have read this year.  I absolutely loved this story of Duncan, who has loved Breena for the last seven years.  Her husband, Duncan's best friend is killed in battle.  Before he dies he ask Duncan to take care of her.  I definitely recommend this story."
4	'On the original Kindle Fire HD the app used a black background with white text. It was much easier to read! I just got the new HDX and, like on my phone, the background is white again.  It should be an OPTION!  I will likely switch to the BBC or CNN app now.'
4	'This was a surprisingly well written and thought out story with many surprises of love and war. I am very glad to have read it.'
4	"Well written, short story about finding the love you thought would never be. I can't imagine being a lesbian in a tiny town back in the 1800's. Makes you rethink what being a spinster really was all about."
3	'This book starts out well but the story gets more and more sloppy and it feels like the author did not know how to connect and finish the different story lines. Very disappointed!'
4	'Darn!! Was not long enough! But loved it any way. And will be buying the others too. Yep, was pretty good!'
3	"I was given this in exchange for an honest review, and honestly I was not impressed.\n\nFirst let me point out the number of pages to any prospective buyers. 78 pages. Yep. It is a serial, not a compete story.\n\nI think I got an early copy and the formatting has since been corrected, so I won't really comment other than to say the copy I had wasn't ready.\n\nThe story idea was interesting. What would an intelligent woman in dire straits do when presented with the opportunity to be a high class escort. But the delivery.... It was like listening to one of those chatty women who has her phone attached to her ear while she's running errands. In line at Starbucks, telling her BFF all about her night at the club. No depth whatsoever. The reader doesn't get to hear any reasons why Bryce might obsessed with her, except her T & A. She's obviously moonstruck by his money and snobbery. I don't get anything other than physical attraction and lust. And that's okay I guess. But I like more meat to my stories.\n\nThe sex is nice and sweet, with a little kink thrown in. Not terribly descriptive, which is actually a nice change, but it was awkward with the inner dialog only going as deep as OH MY GOD I'M SO TURNED ON! WHAT IS HE DOING TO ME?\n\nI was given all four parts, but I can't say I'll be reading any further. I only have so much time to read, and I'm sure there are better books out there...."
5	'"The Bainbridge Killings" was a terrific beginning to what sounds like a great new series. I really liked it and thought it was even somewhat noir-ish. The protagonist, Jon Stevens shows up in Bainbridge to investigate what are first being called suicides but things aren\'t as they seem. There are other interesting characters that enter in as well such as Holly.\n\nI was very pleasantly surprised at how good this audiobook was. I wish it had been longer and can\'t wait to see where Rick Soper takes the story. I think it has a lot of potential.\n\nMike Romano\'s narration was great. He made it interesting the way he differentiated the characters voices. He did it tastefully and he made it more involving. I wouldn\'t change a thing. My feel is this is a great match up with author/narrator and I look forward to more from both.\n\n"This audiobook was provided by the author, narrator, or publisher at no cost in exchange for an unbiased review courtesy of Audiobook Blast."'
4	"I had never read any of this author's works before so I wasn't sure what to expect when I picked this up for free.  I was very pleased.  She writes very well, the story is cute and interesting and even though it's short you don't feel short changed by it, and it does a great job for setting the next book up.  In the second story it only touches a little bit on their history so it's pretty important to read the prequal first to understand their romance.  Great story, both of them.  I'm half way through the second, one second i'm laughing the next i'm almost crying."
3	"It was good especially for people who need awakening to compassion.  It wasn't realistic but I enjoyed it."
3	"I can't really do too much complaining about a Koontz novel but this is book 2 of a 3 book series... Book one was wayyyyy better. Ashley Bell is the third which I'm about to dive into now..I've heard its Koontz at his best."
4	'Third of five novellas which have the group title The Wisdom Tree. I recommend reading all five, and in order. I enjoyed the clever and subtle connections between them.'
5	"I love this book.  This book is all about Aiden.  Maiden is Meghan's little brother.  They have the same mother and father, but live with the Elam family.  Meghan was adopted, and up until recently, the Elam's believed Aiden was their biological son.  Their birth mother Danua placed a he is on Aiden which makes him seem autistic in the human world.\n\nThis book tells Aiden's story from his point of view.  It is well written, smooth flowing and easy to read.  The author did a great job portraying the characters, their emotions and the experiences they went through.  Once I started the book I couldn't put it down.\n\nI highly recommend reading this series in order to get the full effect."
5	"I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.\n\nBack in high school Zach as the bad boy. He and Willow were alway attracted to each oh he but never hooked up. Graduation came and Zach joined the army. Willow moved away and found herself in a very abusive relationship. Running back to her hometown to escape her abusive ex and with Zach back in town after an assignment away. Running into each other one night, sparks fly. Will one night be enough for these two?\n\nKaylee Song excels at writing books hat are exciting and you can not put down. I always say the newest one is my favorite but let's face it ere all amazing. Zach has his demons and Willow found the most controlling abusive jerk on the planet. He's your love to hate guy and boy of boy I couldn't stand him. But Zach and Willow I rooted and cheered for. Their chemistry if off the charts hot and it makes for an amazing read.\n\nKaylee Song has done it again with a book you don't want to miss."
3	'Had to purchase rest of book.'
4	'I really enjoyed this short story, but I had just one problem with it... it was too short. I felt like as soon as I was getting really into the story, it ended. The plotline could have made for a very interesting, and scary, novel. I really enjoyed it!!'
1	"It was to short it's funny but it needs more action in the book. I like it but I don't it's okay."
5	"Great book if you are looking for that special someone on the net.... Kabir seems to know what he's talking about."
3	"I liked the second half of this book more so than the first half. It wasn't nearly as funny as the other books int he series. This book seemed like more of a filler. I still plan on reading the next book in the series."
3	'This book would be an excellent introduction of children to fantasy. The author has a vivid imagination. The story idea is fabulous. My lone complaint: I wish there was more character development.'
5	'A must read for anyone who wants to write a book. The author of"Enchantment" and "What the Plus" - and entrepreneur tells you everything you want to know about publishing a book, from what word processor to use, to the pros and cons of publishing mechanisms - traditional publishing house or self publishing.'
5	'Light, enjoyable read! Good mystery with a few laughs tossed about. I look forward to reading more by this author.'
5	'Jess almost died by an ambush but was doctored by Willow. He got well and made a lot of new friends. He went on the trail of three bad men and sent them to meet the devil.'
5	'A very enjoyable read, with a wonderful cast of characters. I like how the author entwined all of the characters, so that you got to know them. Even though this story came to a close, I hope there will be others that will focus on the other character. A lovely get away read.'
5	'This book explains about some lost chapters of Roman history, but it is incredibly interesting to read. Lucius Annaeus Seneca was a clever man, whose words were understandable even for fools in that time. His way of teaching stuff was impressive and different comparing to other philosophers of his time, he was able explain things in more simple way, so that can be understood by common people rather than just for  rich geeks. We can observe through this book that his life was filled with so many interesting events, that made me think a lot. This is a great book, I strongly recommend this book for those who likes to think out of the box.'
4	'After I decided to read "Les Misrables" I tried the two free versions available for the Kindle, one published by Arvensa and the other one that looks generic, but both of them had defects of formatting that made me look for something better. I then tried this Fleurus edition and decided to pay the $2 for it--which is very little money when you consider that the book is enormously long. I\'ve now read to the end of Livre 1 of Tome 2 and I\'m happy with my choice of this edition. The formatting is well done and the notes are useful, especially when they translate Latin expressions into French. The reasons why I only gave 4 stars, not 5, are these: (i) There is no table of contents in the book. You can see a list of the contents by taping on the top of the screen and then on "ALLER " (or, I suppose, "GO TO" if your Kindle language is English) but this doesn\'t show the chapters, only the Tomes and Livres. I realize that there are so many chapters that including them would make the list too long to be convenient, but it would be nice if there was a way somewhere to see a list of the chapters in a Livre and go to a specific one. (ii) The default font is very large; I reduced it to something more suitable for me, but now if I change to another book, it\'s font is too small and I have to enlarge it. Then, when I return to "Les Mis" I have to reduce the font size again. I\'ve never had this happen before.\n\nAs for the book itself, it\'s a classic of romantic literature that I think well worth reading---if you have a lot of time!'
3	'slow moving'
4	"Children's book has a generous amount of artwork (tho a couple of panels repeat some of the images). Rhyming could be a bit tighter but message of thankfulness was both inspirational and appreciated. A very good book overall!\n\nI dug thru all my children's books from 4 months ago and for first time ever I will post any offshoots I found for free as of 8:30 am CT for others to enjoy which include:\n\n1) The Elephant and the Apple by Stacie Murphy\n2) Maggie Mouse Gets Lost by Haley Moonspur\n3) Alphabet Family Wedding by Karen Muldoon\n4) The Garden Party by Peter Collier\n5) When I Grow Up by Tracey Morley\n\nI don't know how long they will remain free, but there wasn't a clinker in the bunch in my opinion should it ends up costing money. If people find this helpful I'll go looking back thru my pile from 3 months ago. Enjoy!"
5	"Loved this one from the beginning! I didn't want to put it down. Read it all the way through in one sitting."
2	'So many times I wanted to chunk it, never one to start and not complete a book I pushed through, sap and sex. The humor kept me going...oh boy did I laugh! Not really a bad storyline just too drawn out. Terrible language and from the lady no less. I\'d be embarrassed if my lover had to request I not ask him to"f*** me". One time would be enough for me to change my language; and oh my goodness I usually look for steamy romances but this was overkill!  I found myself in need of a fast forward button to escape yet another love session, if she(Bea) didn\'t EVER, EVER, NEVER;  I got sore for her...geesh who HAS that much sex!  The "I love you\'s"  and "oh baby\'s"were totally unrealistic and on overdrive. I feel victorious however for enduring till the end.'
3	'An enjoyable read, that kept this reader turning the pages.\nRating: 3.5\nSaving an Angle book 3 in the "Saving Grace" series\nBy Robin Peacock\nA fast paced story, with plenty of action to keep any liberal adult reader turning the pages.  This reviewer has not read the first two episodes of the "Saving Grace" series, but will make the effort to do so.  This reviewer found the character of Charlie to be quite interesting but somewhat disturbing, in her swings from caring and compassionate to calculating and revengeful.  As far a rating this book, it has been given considerable thought by this reviewer. As one cannot give a half star rating using any of the star systems, I am going to add the half star here in the text.  After completing this story, the conclusion left this reviewer in a quandary. Without giving away any part of the story,  this reader feels that Mr. Peacock\'s choice for an ending totally changed the reviewers mental image of Charlie, and caused the lower rating that originally projected.\nThis review was done as part of a review group on Goodreads. None of the reviewers or authors receive a reciprocal review by an author that they review. As a reviewer, I did receive a file of the manuscript to use for the review.'

2	'Interesting idea but I was a bit uncomfortable with the maincharacter being so at ease with the actual torturing of people and wanting to pursue it. It tried for humour but if anything its a very black comedy.'
5	"Beautiful and complicated this story has so many twists and turns it will have your head spinning but in a perfectly happy way. You would think they learned from their mistakes and try to be honest with each other! If that were the case then this would have been a very short book. They have to make these mistakes to grow as a better couple and let me tell you Liam had to do the most growing up! Pride is a terrible thing when it is bruised and that is what keeps these story going because Hails and Liam have forgotten the one thing that can make their lives better.... communication and honesty!\nThe hidden feelings and withheld information makes this for a nail biting read, no seriously, I had to go get my nails done after reading this book!\n But after the nail biting and cursing at my kindle because I was as frustrated with them as their friends were, I was thrilled when they finally see the light!\nA beautiful story that gives hope to those that don't think true love prevails. For me Hailey and Liam are proof that you can't fool your heart, it will always win!\n I am so glad I got to read this amazing story."
5	'I got this story for free (the price has since changed).  For anybody who has read more than a handful of Kindle free short stories, you\'ll be familiar with how difficult it is to find anything worth reading.  This story is good.  I mean really good.  I actually checked when I was done reading it to make sure I had actually gotten it for free and hadn\'t accidently paid for it.  The quality difference between this and the next best free Kindle short story I\'ve read so far . . . worlds apart.\n\nThe premise of the story is somewhat sci-fi - government agencies use "remote viewers," people trained in psychic abilities, to meet various goals.  In this story, the goal is to recover a lost painting of Vincent Van Gogh\'s.  Maroch, a man with a painful past, is paired with Laure, a woman with a painful past, to guide her through the process of finding the painting.  A relatively simple plot, but Smith turns it into so much more.\n\nNothing is predictable or obvious in this story.  It is beautifully written and incredibly satisfying.  I highly recommend this story and plan to read more of the author\'s work.'
5	"We love stories in this house! I am an avid reader and my boys get tired of the same old thing over and over. It's always fun to read new stories. I like this book a lot because it puts a twist on old favorites to make them something new and interesting. My youngest loves the new take and the different points to of view that these books take. They were light hearted and funny and written on a level so thag children understand without being confused by to many bigger words. The best part is my oldest could read them too with a little help so he could practice reading with a book that is a little longer but is still on a beginner type level.

1	'I do some saltwater fishing and was hoping this would be a good reference. I was very disappointed. It took all of 15 minutes to read cover to cover, it stated the obvious ( Buy saltwater gear, take care of your gear, wear a life jacket, etc.) with no useful information.'
4	"Ha! I wish every woman reads this book, especially those in school! If I had read this booka year ago, I would still have a boyfriend today. 'Understanding Men' explains everything you need to know about being in a happy relationship. It gives you tips on how to treat yourself and men, which was very interning! I really liked chapter 4 on how to keep him interested Most relationships get boring after awhile and Chapter 4 really lets you know how to get past that speed bump. If i could, I would give a copy of this book to all my girlfriends!!"
5	"This book pulls you in from beginning to end. These people lives have to many twists and turns. I can't wait for the next book."
5	'Had me hooked from the prologue.  Fast moving from chapter to chapter, while being drawn in deeper and deeper to the very end.'
5	'This book is the real deal. As a carnival connoisseur i feel as though all of the necessary information that a carnival virgin needs to survive TNT Carnival is contained in this book. Many virgins have attempted to concur the beast called TNT Carnival without any type of preparation or guidance from a veteran and they paid the price. As a result of their failure they are now leading actors in stories/jokes that will be told for years to come.'

4	'I really loved this book! It was an easy and fast read! I am anxious to read more from Sally Mason.'
2	'I purchased this book because I assumed it would give massage instructions for the neck areas. NONE.  Mostly personal accounts of results and pitches to buy his products or vague referrals to unnown people he has trained. His videos on the web, which I saw before buying the book are better than anything in the book.  Book was a waste of my money.'
3	'Quite a pleasant read, the ending was a little rushed'
4	'I am a survivor and I thought, while reading this book, why I had not written such letters.  It\n showed so much love to those who were left behind.'
4	"I enjoyed the inclusion of characters from both of  Cassandra Claire's Mortal Instruments series at the end of this book.  So am wanting more of her work in the World of the Shadowhunters"
4	'I would recommend this book to all people who like reading Amish books. This book was very well written. Thank you'

5	"When I was diagnosed with gout I was absolutely terrified. I had all these awful images in my head of what gout looked like back in the 1800s. I was so relieved to find out that it wasn't like that at all and could be beaten simply by exercising and eating well. Dr. Barak's book was so simple to understand and was packed with incredible information. I'm not much of a cook, but the recipes were easy to follow, and tasted AMAZING. I have been following the advice in the book and have definitely noticed I am getting far less flare ups! I am so happy to be living life without a constant fear of waking up in agony. I will continue to use Eat, Treat, & Beat Gout and hope that with prolonged use I will stop having episodes all together. I am so glad I purchased this book and definitely recommend it to anyone who is currently suffering. It can get better!"
5	'Great'
4	"I loved the story and the characters. However, the ending came too quick. If there was a limit in pages you were permitted to write, then I could see how three weeks after meeting they get engaged. Blaine even commented a few pages before the end how he didn't even know her. It needed another fifty pages at least to end where it did. So the book had potential,  just too rushed."
5	'Kristi Avalon is becoming another fav author, anything she put together is a real good read'
5	"It's crazy to think that there are still people in arranged engagements!  I'm so glad that she was able to get away for awhile in an awesome place like Snow Valley!  Kellen has come a long way and she has no problem helping him!  I love the kissing wish list!  Cute story with great characters, but now I need a cute dress and cowboy boots!  I would suggest reading Catching Caytie first, even if they're both stand alones!"
5	"Vivian Rose Lee has done it again! I love the (HEART SERIES) Can't wait for the next installment!! Keep em coming!!"
5	"Investing in stock is not as easy as you think. You need to know when to invest and when to sell those shares. Coming up with a strategy is a must in order to win this trading market. As I have knowledge what penny stocks is all about, I digested this book really well. Since the author wrote this book in an excellent way, I learned a lot and moticated myself until I finished reading it. If so happens that you do not have any background in trading stocks, you should buy this book. It's a great guide for the rookies who are just starting to let themselves inside the stock market. It like the teachings from the author. How I wish I can manage to follow exactly what the author said in this book when I enter the world of penny stocks. This is a great book!"
4	"This was a short good read romance story. I don't think that Melanie being eight years older than Corbin was no big deal. However she was a cougar that was able to give Corbin a baby."
5	"this book is amazing I could read it over and over again and still be amazed I mean that's why I made this review."
5	'Did you ever wonder how society moved from what we know today to what is most often described as "Steam Punk?"  Well, wonder no more!  This is a fabulous attempt to detail just what would be involved in making such a shift.  I don\'t normally like Steam Punk, but I loved this one!  Great story, wonderful characters!\n\nI was given a copy by the publisher in exchange for an honest review.'
5	'Summaries like those by "edify me" make quick reading and allow absorption of complex texts effectively. They can help me decide whether to go on to study the whole book or be sufficient themselves. I found this Summary particularly concise and useful.'
4	"A classic that never grows old. It's so much fun to re-read books enjoyed in one's past......"
5	"This book is fantastic! Rebecca has outdone herself in this second book in the series. She captures your imagination and you feel like you are there with the characters. I can't wait for the next one."
4	"I read all 4 books (plus the 5th, purchsed separately) in the space of a week when travelling.  I can't wait until the last book comes out.  These were great books for reading on a trip - you could put it down and pick it up easily, without losing any of the train of the story.  Well written."
5	"Great! The world  needs more of this kind of truth to survive and for enlightenment. I hope there's more?\n\nDex"
5	"I enjoyed reading this book! Great story line, well defined characters and the ability to relate. I loved the fact it's not a cliff hanger. I'd I mention it wasn't a cliff hanger?? All jokes aside I could not put this book down until I finish reading it. If there was anything I disliked about the book; I would have loved to seen Mia not so forgiven. I would recommend !"

5	"I really loved this series, I don't know where to begin. But I do know that conquer all and Briana and Persia found that love that unconditional. Even though both was crazy af they went through hell and high water to get them. I hate that it had to end but I couldn't ask for a better ending!!"
5	'LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! Seriously so fun and so entertaining! Recommend to anyone who enjoys a good read!'
4	'Mostly a fascinating book. But towards the end, kinda boring.\nBut a good overall read. Thanks for the information.'
4	'Arctic Wonders by Speedy Publishing is a book with gorgeous arctic pictures and a paragraph a page explaining different things about the arctic. The explanations are not on young kids level so it is a bit confusing as to what age this is for. Not the picture book age, maybe middle grades that enjoy beautiful images. I enjoyed the pictures and the info. It is a small book but very nicely done. It needed to be longer but it was free.'
5	"Love all three of these book couldn't stop reading. Cuz had me worried for a minute he was working hard to get Lisa out but seem like he gave up on Precious. He did not even know that she was getting out."

5	'Non-stop fun but I miss Nanna.'
5	'After spending the day trying to rent a wheelchair for my father from 150 miles away, I decided that I had to get this book.  As a physician, it is surprising to me how arduous a task it can be just to accomplish simple tasks in caring for the aging baby boomers.  If you have parents, are a parent, or plan to be one someday, GET THIS BOOK.  Karen is funny and has a quirky perspective that makes her stories very readable, funny and personal.  This book will help folks on both side of the caregiver/parent relationship, this is one that I will recommend to my patients and their families as they embark on this phase of their lives.'
3	"Have just glanced through, and I don't really like it as it's all text inside with no pics/graphs/diagrams.  I'm not implying that I can't just read text, but it would be a lot more helpful, particular to someone new to UK, that if the text is complimented by pictures, maps, graphs, diagrams, etc to show you around the country. Sorry, have just returned it for a refund (Kindle version)."
4	"This is the exciting story of a young woman's plan to get revenge against the men that ruined her and her best friend's lives. I loved this story, Yoko is such a strong character. I can't imagine going through everything she has been through and she still turns out to be a strong willed, independent, ambitious woman. Mark the tall, dark, handsome stranger she met by chance turns out to be the best thing that's ever happened to her. I loved them together, Mark brings out the innocent, fun loving side of Yoko. I enjoyed the storyline, the interactions between characters, just the overall book. I'll definitely be reading more books by this author."
4	'I enjoyed reading this story, it is well written.  The characters are well developed and I really liked them. I look forward to reading more from this author.'

5	"I love everyone of Doug Olsen's short stories! Everyone of them are quick reads to pass the time waiting for your appointments!"
5	'Outstanding!  "Your Financial Success" is right on the mark and highly recommended for anyone wanting to get their financial act together. This to-the-point and easy to understand book is full of the time-tested guidelines to help anyone, at any age, start making wise steps towards their financial freedom.  I loved it and know from personal experience that these principles really work.\n\nAnd if this good advice wasn\'t enough, Murphy will send you "financial coach" email reminders for an entire year to review the key concepts of this book and supply you with continual encouragement to help motivate you to put these ideas into practice.  Seriously, what do you have to lose?'
5	"This is first book I've read by Sheila Kell and I have to say it want be my last.  I think I'm going to enjoy reading this series.  Jesse and Kate's story is full of suspense, mystery, action and hot sexy scenes with love and laughs thrown in.  I like the way she included what their lives were like before they meet and reading about the rest of the Hamilton family is going to be fun."
5	'Just love the entire series Four and Tris are the love i have always looked for but never found it'
4	"Loved all three of Elin's Christmas books. The Winter Storm was given to me after my daughter was at a book signing in Edmond, OK. So I got the first two on my Kindle. Loved all three and feel like I'm part of the Quinn family."
1	'I enjoyed this installment. I would like the and more realistic. Nevertheless, it was a well spent 30 minutes. Thanks!'
4	'good quick entertaining read'
5	'The characters in The Berg are well developed and the author is very descriptive. He completely pulled me into the story even though I had not read the other books in the series. I like that he takes the time to let you get to know the characters in the story which of course helps those who have read the other books get more insight. Very exciting! I did receive this book at a discount in exchange for my honest review and I would recommend this book and I plan to read the others in the series.'
5	"Love the characters and the story. There was a good mix of the past to explain what each of the main characters had gone through and how they met. It formed a picture of how and why they acted and reacted the way they did. I can't wait to continue with their story.\n\nLoved Knoxi, but her verbal skill did advance quickly for an almost 2 year old."
4	'Good book with good writing. Perhaps a bit predictable but it left me wanting to read the next story in the series.'
4	"This is the first story I've read from this author, and I was impressed.  The writing is taut and professional, and the plot arc is interesting and generally believable.  The few editing mistakes were minor and easily overlooked.  I plan on reading other works by this author based on the overall quality of this one."

3	"Trivial story of girl meets boy. Boys parents don't approve."
4	"Ok, so I wavered on this one between a 3 and a 4, settled on 3.5 and rounded up to 4, because in the end, the actual writing was phenomenal in terms of description and invoking an emotional response.\n\nIn reality, though - I hated this book.\n\nBut I think maybe that was the point.  The author strove to evoke some sort of strong emotional response out of the reader, and that he did well.  I stayed up last night reading until my eyes were tearing and my head was nodding and I had to give up the good fight and wait until today to finish it.  I'm glad I did, however; I'm glad that when I got to the middle of the book where Pen finally explains the origins of this entire situation, that I was already awake and coherent because being half asleep, I probably would have thrown my treasured Kindle across the room.\n\nFor me, this book was a cross between Emma Donoghue's Room and V.C. Andrews Flowers in the Attic.  This is the story of a family, living their lives out in the basement, no access to the outside world and their only contact, the Cricket Man.  The majority of the story is told from the eyes of the family's youngest son, who I believe was ten years old.  He was born in the basement and has never known anything but the basement, and the strange family that he was born in to, that he loves in spite of everything that happens in the basement.  None of these characters have names; I don't know if the author's intention was to dehumanize them more by refusing to name them, but this actually just really frustrated me in the end.  We have names for a reason, and sometimes figuring out which character was doing what was more confusing than it should have been.\n\nNo matter how else you look at this book, when you get to the end of the book you have to ask yourself - as a parent, would you have made the same decisions?  Would you risk everything to save your child, even go so far as to sacrifice your other child?  Halfway through the book, the author takes you back to the beginning, to the scenario that sent them all down in to the basement.  And part way into that explanation, the author takes you back five years further, to the incident between the sister and older brother that left him mentally handicapped.  Here is where I started to get really angry.  The parents (which, by the way, are probably some of the most horrible parents in the history of parenting) blame their daughter for the reason their son is the way he is.  At the time of the incident, their daughter was THIRTEEN - a child herself.  The same age as my oldest son.  Not an adult, to be held irrevocably responsible for being left in charge of a younger child when she obviously weren't ready for the responsibility.  I look at the situation portrayed, and I look at my oldest son, and I think that there are a hundred other ways this family could have handled everything, from beginning to end, but they panicked and took the cowardly way out, ruining all of their lives in one fell swoop.  They destroyed their daughter, their first born, mentally, physically, in ways that led to her eventual rape (in the basement... where only the family lives or has access too..) and forced birth of her own child, which is one of the opening scenes of the book.\n\nThis is not a book for the faint of heart; it is dark, with plenty of twists and turns that will leave you totally confused until chapters later.  The ending is less than satisfactory; I think most readers will feel that there was an obvious ending being led up to and then Pen takes us and yanks the proverbial rug back out from under our feet, leaving us with an ending that is just as frustrating as the rest of the book.\n\nSo...  I hated the story.  Hated the characters.  And I still gave it four stars, because in the end, it was a very well told story, with the right flow, and because I don't think love was the emotion that Pen was trying to invoke here, anyway (seriously, though... where did he come up with this book from?!)\n\n**I read this book as part of Amazon's Kindle Unlimited subscription.**"

5	'This item is what it was represented to be, and I am most appreciative of the fact that I received what I paid for.'
5	"A page turner ! Hard to put down . I'm only a third thru' the book but can't wait to finish it and read the third book. I hope it is out soon."
2	"The first two book in this series weren't bad, but from chapter three forward, this one reads as though it was written by a young teen. The tenses are mixed, and the conversation stilted. I couldn't finish."
5	'Awesome as always, great addition to the serie'
5	'Ryall extends a raw, personal, uncensored invitation into the bizarre depths of his manic reality. I found it surprisingly both delightful and disturbing. You\'ll delight in the storytelling while consistently having to remind yourself, this is NOT fiction, and therin lies the disturbance. Ryall uses vivid detail and multiple facets of experience to fully envelop the reader and allow us to not only have a better understanding of his personal tragedy but a wider comprehension of mental illness and how it may present itself (with paranoia, delusional behavior and what can only be described as excessive OCD). I found it moving and fascinating.  Accept the invitation that "sanity is subjective" and "if we\'re all mad, then we\'re not really mad are we?"'
5	"I received an eARC in exchange for an honest review.  I really loved this story and I loved Valemont and Rachel.  I loved how these two met for the very first time, and the obstacles they had to go through to be together.\n\nValemont is a strong, sexy white alpha Grizzly bear who is looking for a surrogate to hive him a child.  Rachel is a strong beautiful woman who is willing to be Valemont' s surrogate.\n\nWhat happens after this will keep you totally engrossed in this book and you will be unable to it it down until you have read all the way through to the very last page.  These two have so much to go through before they can be together.\n\nThis author has created a totally new type of shifter series and I loved it.  It had everything romance, life threatening danger, hot hot hot mating and finally an fantastic HEA.\n\nI highly recommend this book and this author and this series to everyone who loves paranormal romances.  I know you will love it as much as I did.  Be sure to pick up a copy for yourself you will be very very glad that you did."
5	"Favorite Quotes:\n\nthe guy in front of me is checking out my boobs, even though they are covered by the ugly jumpsuit.  Its not a trust inspiring moment for me.\n\nYour mother is never quiet.  Where are her huge parties and grand gestures and knife stabbing?\n\nIf I were you, Id be dressing Avery in some Kevlar when you are around your mother.\n\nAs we get out of the car, glancing up toward the window, I swear I hear a choir of angels singing, light shining down from the heavens, wind gently breezing down the sidewalk.  Thats the dress, I say.\n\nYou are my light, my beacon, and Ill forever look to you for my direction.\n\nMy Review:\n\nI have spent part of the week reading 1069 pages of S. J. Sawyers Sealed series, and it has been one of the best weeks I can ever recall - despite the fact that she devastated me with the ending of Teased I have forgiven her.  While reading her last delight, Secured, I experienced two constant problems.  I couldn't seem to catch my breath, and I couldn't read fast enough, even though I wanted to savor every word.  It was an enthralling, action packed, drama filled, heart squeezing love story - beginning to end.  And despite the astonishing continued virginal status of the main character, it was also deliciously steamy and sensual.  I couldn't be more thrilled with Ms. Sawyers growth as a writer, and to describe the book in a word  perfection.  It was fun, adventuresome, sweet, tender, and devilishly exciting with hits of conflict and high melodrama sprinkled throughout.  I adore her characters, and her vivid and highly descriptive writing.  But then the ending gasp  I think my jaded heart actually took flight.  I have only two requests of Ms. Sawyer  more and please hurry."
5	'Love this kindle version.  Its so great; easy to maneuver through and was very inexpensive...old testament and new :) Highly recommend.'

5	"Finally it is here!! I have been waiting for this book and I was not disappointed!! Xavier and Lola have an intense love/hate relationship and you never knew if Lola wanted to slap or kiss Xavier!! Xavier is a prince who is also an instructor at the school Lola is attending in London. I know Xavier's attitude was that way because he is use to getting what he wants, but that doesn't give him permission to treat Lola the way he does. I really don't know how Lola put up with him, but after being BFFs with Anna I could kind of see why. I loved Xavier's brother Sebastian though; hopefully he will get his own story ( hint, hint)! Can't wait for the next part in July!!!"

5	'I loved this book as well as Dark Secrets, Forbidden Desires and The Haven of Obedience. If you love Erotica books these are the books to read.'
5	"This is the second book in the La Flor Series and I will be honest, I cried hard. That shouldn't shock me since ML tends to write books that make you cry and feel so many emotions.\n\nIt was an amazing book and I loved Julia's story and struggle. I can't dive to much because it will be a spoiler but it was amazing and I can't wait for book three now."
5	"This book is about a funny way they make dogs that people call up to order. More for a child book. Someone called up an order for a nice looking dachshund with everything perfect in this dog but something happened and this dachshund got doberman parts also and he turned out to be extra long dachshund with a doberman head so the people who ordered this dachshund took him to a pet store to sell him. He wasn't handsome. From then on he was sold to another home just because the boy was looking at him and this dog knew how to be funny and make people laugh. The story goes on from there. Great book for a child."
5	'Witty, fun, steamy, and an easy read. What more could you want!'
5	'The Dragonfly Door is a triumph for Margaret Millmore. This is a page-turner of a story that starts out a little slow but gathers momemtum like a steam roller and carries the reader along with it. A panoply of well-developed characters take you from the present to the future and back again in a dramatic cloud of dragonflies who possess miraculous scientific capabilities such as our present-day drones are developing. We move from the streets of San Francisco to a Bio-sphere in Ice Age North America as scientists, some good, some evil, seek to change the past to control the future in a battle of New World Order conspiracy dominaters against the good-guy humanists. Our heroe, Frank Mann, a trust-fund baby who has to grow up in a hurry and finds true romance in the process, confronts his past, his present and his future in simultaneous trips through a maze of pitfalls and dangerous characters who present unknowable consequences both for him and the human race. This is a very excellent and entertaining read.'
5	"The Vampire Favors series is getting more and more interesting with each book. Give and Take is the 2nd book, and it doesnt disappoint. Exciting and full of action, this book will keep you on your toes.\n\nCyrs characters keep growing and growing. We see different aspects of Cannon than we did in the first book. It doesnt change my dislike of him though. I still want to throat punch him. He is, however, a necessary evil. Addison iswell, Addison. She is still snarky and fun, but tortured at the same time. Im really curious as to what she is going to do in the next book. Cyr has definitely given her a dilemma that only she can work out.\n\nOne cool thing about this book is the introduction of an unusual supernatural being that I haven't heard much of before. Im not telling you what it is though. Just know that things are getting deep in the world of Addison Fitzpatrick.\n\nGive and Take is a great continuation of the Vampire Favors series and if you haven't read the first book, Push and Pull yet, you really should. Each book leaves you dying to know what is going to happen next."
5	'I enjoyed the book the story line was good. Not everybody got their happy ending but in the end most of the girls found the love that they have always longest for.  I  think you should most definitely do the part two to the book. But you need a better editor because the errors in the book made it hard to read. Trying to figure out what was trying to be said.'

5	"If you're involved in business strategy, tactics, leadership, stock picking, or forecasting, please at least read Chapter 19.\nIf you're a serious student of economics, there are many key studies discussed here that undermine (or at least add much complexity) concerning the basic assumptions of rational/consistent/coherent decision making.\n\nThis book is a summary of Nobel Prize winner Daniel Kahneman's life's work on decision making ... and update/revision of his early work with Tversky ... and an expansive elaboration of new findings by others. There is a lot here.  It might overwhelm you if you are new to genre of critical thinking and behavioral psychology.  But it's  n important, very thorough, and most current report of how we process information and make decisions/judgments so poorly so often ... and what we can do to (only somewhat) address it. At least you'll recognize we are ALL susceptible in very surprising ways. (TIP - frown to activate System 2)."

5	"The story of Dark Waters is creative, imaginative, and very unique. Everything is expressed by a vivid and smooth writing style from start to finish and I don't recall coming across any substantial grammatical or formatting errors (which is something I can't say for most Kindle books).\n\nThere's a definite suspense vibe that blends in perfectly with the overall pace of the story which did a great job of keeping me engaged and hooked from the very beginning. I started reading Dark Waters by pure chance without any kind of preconceptions or bias, and admittedly I may have even been skeptical at first, so I found myself pleasantly surprised within the first few chapters when I realized that I had stumbled upon a structured and clearly talented author.\n\nOverall, I'd give Dark Waters a strong 8.5 out of 10, I look forward to seeing how the series plays out."

5	"Story was well written Rachel and Ethan's story was as good as their book. I enjoyed the family ties and love shared"
5	'Not bad. The writing style was pretty good and I enjoyed the story line too. Stories that depict evolving humanity into something far better is what makes this story so entertaining.'
4	"I love the fact that there is a cook book that helps with hypertension. The fact that it give portion sizes and a description, like about the size of a deck of cards, because, honestly, I don't have a scale hanging around my kitchen to tell me how big 3 ounces is.\nThe variety sounds delicious and it tells you how to stay with the meal plan when at the store.\nThe various health perks are a real win for me.\nThe down fall is that shopping for whole and fresh food is more expensive than processed food. Still how much is your health worth in the end?\nBrittany C."

1	"I have given this rating because I don't think this book would be enlightening to anyone who is not a biblical literalist..  A strict literal interpretation of Scripture is not enlightening for me."
4	"I'll be honest, I was conflicted by Tug and Maria's relationship in the first book as I felt like the women Tug was drawn to had already been involved with Brady. That being said I was shocked by the turn of events in this book! This story was very emotional as we see how Tug deals with Maria's hustle. I never saw Tug's story going in this direction but I'm glad it has."

3	'Wish this was in book form and audible form, will love to listen to this book in car and have hard copy to go back to as reference. Not sure if I will get this type of book in Kindle form.  Will wait for hard copy and audible book.  In the mean time will update this review when book is available or audio book.  This type of book needs a hard copy...'
5	'Loved it. Read all 4 in one day. So ready for the 5th one.'
2	"First off I am so sick of authors pimping their next series before this one ends. I get it after 5+ years you're done writing about Jace and Clary. Frankly I don't care about the Blackthorns! I had to skip over huge sections of this book (Maia and the wolves) Could care less about them pack leader bla bla, same with the vampires. Only the Fae were interesting and there wasn't enough of them, seeing as they will be the focus of her next series! Don't even get me started on the whack theology interwoven into this! if your going to use bible verses it would help if you actually had a bible and didn't do a google search. I especially found the part why Satan had been cast out of Heaven laughable! He wouldn't bow to humans...UM NO he wanted to put his throne higher than Gods! Also angels are not better than humans, they are a lesser creature and no way above humans. I don't expect a YA book to want to give accurate biblical accounts! Moving on Clary and Jace ***SPOILER*** they go into a demon realm not having enough food and water but Jace brought a condom?!! Isn't there a rune to prevent teen pregnancy?! I'm so done with Cassandra Clare!"

4	"4 and 1/2 Stars\n\nI received an ARC in exchange for an honest review when I signed up for the release blitz tour. I made no guarantee of a favorable review.\n\nI love reading Arthurian legends so I just had to sign up to host the tour and I am very pleased that I did. My only regret is that it was way to short. The story line moves flawlessly and the author takes the time to ensnare you within her web. The characters are well written and engaging. The fighting sequence was simply amazing and I felt like I was right there cheering Gyan on as she battled Camilla. I also enjoyed the fact that this wasn't a romantic retelling; not that there would have been anything wrong with that but it just would have thrown the story of course.\n\nThis was the first book I've read written by this author and I look forward to seeing what the author comes up with next and how the story will continue."
4	"I love stories on ancient times and THE FIRE THAT ATE THE MOUNTAIN didn't disappoint. Since I write the same genre, prehistoric fiction (EDGE OF THE NEW WORLD series) and thrillers, I am happy to see that the author included a love story. Love is an important part of human nature and has been for the beginning of time. To ignore that is disregarding an integral part of what makes us human."

The action is well paced, the characters well-drawn and romances fun to watch.\nIt's good to know this is a series so we can see more of Ted,Chris, and Cat\nAs a writer myself I appreciate the crafting of the story and the twists and turns Penn has managed so well.\nI highly recommend Penn's books,"

3	"The basic principles are here, I would have preferred the were illustrations that accompany the directions. There are pictures but they don't help to get an idea of directionality in the massage, some areas are not as clear as other books on massage.

5	'Great book'
5	"Gold Rush Barons is a wonderful end to a well-loved series. It was so nice to see the development of Lucinda and George's relationship, home-life, and work-life. And the end was satisfying. A nice glimpse into their future together and how it would likely play out. I love the period details, too, so seamlessly woven into the narrative. And Lucinda's mix of herbal and medical knowledge always astounds me. Well done!"

5	"Ive seen this adorable breed around, but didn't even know its name. This book, written by expert dog handler Margaret Davis, is a concise, highly detailed owners guide to understanding the breed, from the behavior to the physical health. From the basics to more advanced information, this book has it. The Cavachon is a designer breed that is a combination of the best attributes of the parent breedsthe Cavalier King Charles Spaniel and the Bichon Frise It is a small-sized dog with a think curly coat and loving demeanor thats difficult to resist and perfect for anyone who is looking for a wonderful pet, but possibly not a lot of space. The book is chock full of all sorts of information including the type of exercise necessary to maintain your pups good health, initial cost you can expect when homing a new dog, and the pros and cons of owning this breed of dog. Davis also addresses how to determine reputable Cavachon breeders and spot unethical puppy mills.

Nicely written, plus some clear photos, its a perfect choice for anyone interested in this breedwhether you're an experienced dog owner or not, there is plenty of valuable information."

1	'First of all, its totally over priced even if one was capable of reading it on a Kindle.  Which one cannot as the formatting is totally skewed.  Skip it or waste your $$$.'
5	'A funny informative book worthy of any rock music collector. A trip back in music'
4	'An excellent book. Well written. I wish the author had gone more into his story, rather than just telling bits & pieces. I was expecting a book, what I got was a small section of the entire book. I did enjoy what I read. The author put into words what I have thought all along. Had it been the entire book, would have given it 5 stars.'

And I have started trying some of the tips and no I am not sleeping every night flawless, but my sleep is definitely improving.

5	"This is erotic in a way that is so unexpected! It's definitely not your grandma's romance novel.  I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking to explore a new, exotic type of erotica.  It will not disappoint."
5	'Well written, sweet story line, and some very funny dialogue! It is a short story, but a pleasant hour or two.'
5	"This was a great ending to the trilogy.  I loved each story more than the last.  Clint was probably my favorite out of all of them.  I can't help but wonder... What happened to Parker? Lol"
5	'Most people fear death or long for just a little more time with the ones they love, however, in this short story, D.K. Cassidy takes us down a different path. This path leads us to a world where there is no death in site, where everyone is immortal, where everything appears hopeless and never ending and where death is a dream. (I obtained this novella from an author promotion on insta-freebie. Glad I took it)'
4	'Body Wave is an exciting mystery with some interesting soul.  It shines in its main character, its insider view of nursing, and its always interesting setting in the grand old city of Mobile.  If you are into mysteries, nursing, hurricanes, and local lore, you will enjoy this book.'
1	'This story was over before it even began!  I cannot believe anyone would rate this "book" worth reading.  I even read it twice to try to figure out just what it was that I must be missing.  I would not recommend thid book to anyone.  It is an enormous waste one time.  You will not see me wasting my money on another of this authors "short (????) stories" . There are too many really good authors out there to invest in that will truly provide an entertaining read.'
5	"What a great story! I had to keep reading to find out what else would happen to hapless Howard, poor guy. I know, he's at a prison camp for a good reason, but still. He made a couple of horrible decisions and ruined lives, including his own, but without evil intent. I had to feel just a tiny bit sorry for him. I'm not sure he counted surviving until the end of the book as a good thing. He seems to be a disaster waiting to happen, no matter where he is.\n\nI appreciate a well written story that moves smoothly, as this one does. There was more detail and description than I would expect to find in a short work. I thought the description of the island's history was especially well done. The circumstances that make the story science fiction are not a new idea, but works well within the setting, and does incorporate a surprise or two.\n\nI enjoyed this short book very much, and look forward to reading the new sequel."
5	'great  cant wait for the next one.'

5	'Excellent book for anyone wanting to get into diving.'

4	'I really enjoyed this book.  The writing is pretty typical for a self-published new adult romance, with characters who lack depth and arguments that stem from nowhere, but I still liked it. The men in this book were dreamy and i couldn\'t get enough. Three things kept me from giving this a 5 star review:\n\n1. Emerson is a self-proclaimed slut, but that just isn\'t something I want in a romance. No one gives her a hard time for it which is unrealistic but ok. My main problem with her behavior, however, is that her motivation for sleeping around seems too tenuous...her parents had an affair with each other so this translates into all men suck and are cheaters? I wish she had a more solid reason for her behavior...it would have made me like her better.\n\n2. The drama...oh, the drama. I actually enjoyed the last 1/3 of the book which is very dramatic, but I found the majority of the drama exhausting. And the author had the annoying habit of injecting unnecessary characters for two seconds just to stir the pot when things finally seem calm. (Oh everyone\'s happy for 10 minutes? Bam! Ex girlfriend shows up. But now she\'s gone.)\n\n3.  The title!! I wish everyone would jump off the "beautiful" bandwagon in new adult romance. I swear I\'ve read every permutation of the word beautiful tacked on to a title when it doesn\'t need to be there.\n\nOverall, this was exactly what I wanted when I picked it up. While there are definite problems with it, I still really enjoyed it.'
3	"The was not bad, but not great either. The main problems are:\nA) Not much happens. I found myself skimming the 1st half of the book to get to more interesting parts- both in action and romantic moments.\nB) Sylvie's character is so...not exciting. Kind of bland. But that sums up the whole story, really. Like Vanilla pudding for dessert. Nobody dislikes vanilla pudding, but would rather have something more rich and exotic. He is a little growly, but besides that spends most of the book mooning after her in a very un-alpha way. Nothing much makes this story memorable or stand out amongst others just like it."
3	"The Girl is a pleasant and easy read with some real charm. Hemingway's Ghost jabs a few times, and the author jabs back. There is no real brawl here, however. Schaffer tip toes around the ring, throws in some musings about the brutal symbolism of bull fights, and then takes his seat in the corner, patting at his face with his towel. No real exertion, not much sweat, and no blood. It is a genuinely charming read, and this is a real virtue, but it is also the book's shortcoming. If you are going to evoke Hemingway and the toreador's passionate encounter with the brutal beast, you should provide more than charm. In this tale there is a writer seeking significance. I suspect there is some significance that the author--the real author--seeks. But in this breezy story he doesn't bring it into the bull (or boxing) ring. Hemingway wins by a knockout, and the bull saunters off, snorting..."
1	'Same as other romance books'
5	'It was a great story.  The language was a little harsh for younger readers.  I am looking forward to the next book.'
5	"I have fallen in love with this book. To begin I saw the workings of a great mind when I realized the vividness he put into the dystopian setting that the story took place. I found myself lost in the bleakness of it all and I must say it takes a special person to captivate all aspects of the senses so thoroughly. The story was fast paced and many times I felt as though I couldn't be sure that was coming next. This really added to the appeal of the story. As a read the story I became more enchanted with Aurelia's character. She represents such strength and power in a woman. The love triangle is the best part for me. It is evident through the writing that the conflict outside is sore and that her choice will be a defining moment, a bit like that of the Hunger Games. I enjoyed the effort the author put into developing these characters and their struggle not only for the world they live in but also for their love."
4	'Only Tilly Greene could write something so delicious you want to take a bite of the apple and fall in love with the "snake". Lucifer has a heart, granted it might not be as good or holy as others, but he has one.... and his little object of desire is going to see every dark piece of it. Ohhhhh and does she. I wish I were Nia.'
5	"More Than Friends is a passionate and sensual tale about being more than just friends. The chemistry between Brian and Jeni is scorching. Friends with benefits is everyone's dream, but for Brian and Jeni that dream is a reality. Through everything  that life throws at them, they are there for each other. The good, the bad, and the crazy! Can they make a real relationship work? Sometimes true love is standing right in front of you.\n\nJessica Jayne arouses the reader with her passionate writing and romantic notions. Her characters win the heart of the reader through their love, loyalty, and unwavering drive not to give up. More Than Friends has a nice balance of romance, drama, and sexiness! This is a quick, fun, and feel good story that you will devour in one sitting."
5	"I love all of her books very exciting and suspenseful. I have grown to love the characters and look forward to the next adventure. You must read all of the series. I'm a fan ."
3	"The story was good but didn't end up going anywhere the character's were ok but not very deep.the story is the same as the other one and it just ended like a page torn out of a book,I will not invest in this series again and let me say there was no wicked nites"
5	"There are 4 books out in this series. I with out a doubt loved this one the most!!!This was my birthday read and I could not have picked a better book and author to give me a great story. Dex and Crissy have know each other for ever. They grew from friends to best friends to finally admitting the love they had for each other. Dex was always her protector..she kinda needed one. Her child hood was bad but she tried to stay as strong as she could,especially for her dad. Im sure For her to finally let her dad go was hard...but Dex was there holding her  hand the whole time. Loving this series sooo much. But I'm pretty sure Dex will be the top Boyfriend for me in this series. There is no one else out there like Dex!! DONT WASTE Anymore time...CHECK OUT THIS SERIES.I promise you are going to love every book and every chapter. Awesome job Michelle Lynn"
5	'This was something different for me to read but I absolutely loved it.  A different take on a HEA.  I would suggest a new cover as it doesnt reflect whats inside.'
5	'This book presents effective solutions to homesickness. Homesickness can happen to anyone. This book has great tips and solutions for different types of people and different situations of homesickness. This book is well organized. I liked the tips. Recommended.'
4	"This is not like the books I typically read. I am drawn to happy light romances but thought I'd give this a try since I have enjoyed so many other Tule Books & authors. This book was about Lucy & Gloria whose lives were intertwined and turned upside down by the same man. It was about love and loss and rebuilding. It is definitely not a light read but interesting and complex. After reading this I would definitely pick up another book by Carol Marinelli."
4	"Ffs I didn't think this ride could get any crazier but omg I was wrong so very wrong his ride was more so much more and it pulled my emotions in so many ways that I just didn't know how to deal with them the things that happened I did not see coming and did not expect the people I did not like in book one really grew on me and completely redeemed themselves and I then there were the fcukers who deserved every single thing they got and still we have the badass's that are The Parker boys standing strong along with Ragan and Haley.  Right now I need a break for a day or two to process and come to terms with my feelings but then......then I'll be diving into book 3 for which I think is going to be the biggest fiercest most thrilling book in this series !!!!!\n\nAnother epic worthy 4.5 read"
4	"of a timeless story. It's really beautifully told. I just wish there was decent editing. So far all of her books suffer from poor editing, which is a shame. At one point the main character is referred to as Nora. Her name is Clara. But there are also a lot of missing words and incorrect word tense. It's annoying, but not enough to make me stop reading the story."
1	'Could not finish it even though I tried.  The first of this series was just a short novella and it looked promising.  Thanes favorite line...get in the back of the pickup as he wanted to get laid.  Ridiculous!'
5	'Humble and appreciative, this is a great book for anyone interested in coaching and/or how a coach can affect the lives of\nthose around him/her'
2	"I just could not get into this book.  I didn't like the characters and the story dragged. it was easy to figure out who did it way before the end. it skipped around from here to there and was hard to follow.  it also had too much profanity for me. I do not recommend it."
3	'Lots .of spelling and grammatical errors.  Overall a good book and one of the few not from humans perspective.  It starts off telling of the human goblin war until the son of the duke is captured and he spends a year living as a goblin slave.  Great book for showing that not everything is always as it seems.'
5	'Has been one of my favorite books of all time\nTakes you back to a time and place that is so very different from life now. However the love stories are.timelessness'
5	'Excellent product and service'
5	'I love this author!'
5	'Nice short stories for when you have just a few minutes or for when you want something to read and be able to finish when your children are watching the same Sophia the First for the 5th time.'
2	'I finished the first book in this series and thought it was mediocre but offered enough adventure to make me want to see how the story played out.  The cliffhanger in the end of course led me to purchase this next installment.\nI cannot stomach this 2nd book.\nMeaning I can\'t get past the first few chapters.\nSEARCH has a mundane cliche story line, that is unfolding as lazy, convenient and predictable.\nI thought i was getting YA Urban Fantasy when I started this series, and was surprised by all the character\'s first person POV & inner dialogue about sex sex sex.  I\'m thinking this is more a romance-smut genre novel.  But I came across the first book in YA Urban fantasy...-ohwell\n\n**plot line spoiler (-ish)**\nMy reason for calling this mundane cliche and lazy:\n-The heroine is torn between two dudes -good guy rivals. One very goody two shoes but tough and good fighter ; the other bad boy snarky-pants that forces love-hate relations, also tough and good fighter. Both on the side of GOOD (vs evil).\n-The heroine began to discover her history (and her love interest) in the first intallment\n-The second installment is supposed to elaborate on that plot, but it just goes into her new found riches and even more guys revealing their affections for her .  And she feels \'soooo reluctant, torn and out of place, blah blah blah\'. smh\nThis story is unfolding to be a mary-sue Princess Bride snore bore...just boring.\nThe whole time I was speed reading through the  pages (trying to stomach the snore fest in effort to get to any semblance of adventure), all I could think is, "I could be reading something else...Something interesting...that I actually enjoy..."\nSo, I closed this book. I hate starting a story and not finishing it, but with so many other great kindle books in my library, I cannot waste valuable brain cells on this book.  Maybe on a bored day, with no other viable options, I\'ll revisit and finish this one.\n\'Til then, I  don\'t recommend this book.'
3	'I was excited to get this book. I absolutely love elephants. They\'re beautiul,, huge, majestic creatures. That\'s where my enthusiasm came from. Now I knew that most of the pictures wouldn\'t just be elephants, because it\'s "Wonders of India" but with that in mind, about one fourth of the pictures there, I had absolutely no clue what they were. Some of the pictures were absolutely beautiful, but some were just lacking the necessary definitions to truly see what they were. I love most coloring books by this creater, but this one just isn\'t my favorite unfortunately. I can see myself printing off a few to color and use as some sort of decoration (I love using coloring pictures to decorate in frames and do other things). I just wish that there were more that Had great details and definition so we could reasonably understand them. I did receive his product for free in exchane for an honest and unbiased review.'
5	"As a person who got bullied in school, a lot of the advice in this book resonated with me. It gives good advice for the parent on how to recognize that their child is getting bullied, why a child might not tell his/her parents of what's happening, and many practical steps on how to deal with all of it. I highly recommend this book."
5	'This is an excellent book and it has alot of information and pictures.  It came with everything I needed for class:  the book, the atlas, cd and an access code.  Plus this was a very good price considering all that came with it.  I also got this shipped to me super fast by Amazon.'
2	"I think this author writes well but I really did not like the heroine of this novel and since we are in first person, we are in only her head. This dislike ruined the book for me because I think it was a matter of lack of character development more than a personal distaste for a kind of personality.\n\nI get that one can be damaged by a past relationship and her confidence was shaken but this became her dominate personality trait. It would also be very inappropriate for a therapist to just hand out love advice and makes what MFT does much less complex that the job actually is so that bothered me. She wasn't quirky, thoughtful, self reflective, crass or any thing else than her feelings for her past relationship. I have no idea why her friends liked her or why Ethan, the hero would.\n\nI liked the setting of Sacromento. I love romances set in well know but lesser know places. I might try another book by this writer as the detail work here was good enough to take the risk of time.\n\nI was given this book for my honest review so there you have it."
5	'Great book part 1 and 2.. Did not want it to end!! Takerra is by far the best hands down....'
5	'It keeps you entertain wondering whats happening next and who is good or bad. Good story line. Must read if you like mystery that keeps you guessing.'
4	'I was given an ARC by the author for an honest review\n\nAnother great installment in the story of lilliana ,Connor and Graeme.\n\nThe struggles keep going and Connor is fighting for his life while\nan attack against the three is being made.\nBalances are changing and their running keeps going.\n\nQuick paced,funny ,filled with action once again a really great story!!!\n\nOnly minus is that at times especially in the sex scenes i felt like the author over did it sometimes with the words!\n\nStill a great continuation!!!'
5	"Awesome, loving, funny, thrills, tears, anger, exciting, different, steamy, beautiful, learning, animals, greed, Exquisite, I can't think of anymore words to describe how much I loved these books."
5	"I love all of Monica's work, but these books are a great read.  I love a good, easy read that lets me escape from reality for a while, and this is definitely it.  I can't wait for the next book!"
5	'We are really pleased with this book and these cute little monkeys.  My four-year old has been asking for these stories even over his beloved "Old Mother West Wind".  So, even though Christmas is over, we\'re still reading about the little monkeys.\n\nI love that the stories are interactive and even give the parents the words to engage the child.  There is even prompting based on the response your child gives, which helps you remember to really read and not just say the words in front of you.\n\nI felt like the book was age appropriate, complex enough to keep his mind active and with good morals and themes, but done subtly.  I\'m really happy with this book and highly recommend it.  We will be purchasing other "Three Monkeys" books'
5	"this series was great...I couldn't put the books now..this one out of the series was very good,  I liked the gambling part in it and they have a lot of action... love them"
5	"great book that really made my girl scream, i can attest to how much information is in here that i used for the forces of good. i would rate myself as decent in the sack, but this book blasted me to the next level. lots of common sensical stuff in here, but also lots of smart insightful stuff into the psychology of sex. and isn't sex mostly mental?"
5	'WOW!\n\n"Growing Herbs" was such a great book!\n\nIt thoroughly discussed everything you need to know to grow wonderful herbs for all sorts of uses.\n\nIf you want to grow all sorts of herbs in all sorts of places -- you NEED this book.\n\nIt will make things so much easier and faster for you.\n\nHighly recommended!'

4	"I really enjoyed this book.  Stefen is a known womanizer while Leah is a quiet reserved woman.  She falls for Stefen's charms and into his bed.  But it ends horribly.  After Stefen is attacked because of a legal case he defended, he goes back to his cousins to rehab, and maybe get forgiveness from Leah.  Leah of course forgives hm after some time and they get their HEA!  Not without some drama along the way, but definitely all good stuff that makes the story complete!"
4	"I recommend this book. It is an easy enjoyable read.  The use of twins, a male and female set, is an interesting twist. I cannot wait to see how Erie and Deckline's story plays out.\nThe main hero and heroine needed more of a connection, IMO. Also, why is so set against holdings? Eva switched from hardline no shifter attitude to being lovely with Elijah, it was difficult to connect to her. But it was still an enjoyable couple hours read. I look forward to watching it unfold."
5	'Loved it. Just enough Hot and Steamy. Just enough angst Just enough Funny to make this stand alone a wonderful read. I needed a good funny read and a strong female character. Hey throw a hot male love interest in and it makes for the perfect story. Read it you will love it too'
4	'I would recommend this to everyone. It is an enjoyable read. I love a good love story. I wish the story was filled out a little,it would make a good novel.\nThanks'
5	"Story has a great folks can't wait to read the rest of the books in her series. I can tell its only going to get better."
4	'This sweet light romance was a clean easy read. Though the characters were engaging, both primary and secondary, the pacing was a bit off for me. The story seemed to speed up, with less description, towards the end, so the ending seemed rather abrupt. Don\'t get me wrong, I am a sucker for a cowboy book, especially one that brings the sweet and funny, which this one does. It was well plotted, with so many accidental "adventures" I can\'t count. I would read more from Maggie McGinnis.\n*I received my copy from NetGalley.com in exchange for an honest review.'
5	'I wanted a sexy short story to distract me from the house work I should be doing, and this was definitely a good choice! I would like to read more about this couple,  so I will surely by looking into the Decadence Creek series.'
5	'So worth your time and get ready to be intrigued! From start to finish in just this first episode, I already started adding the additional episodes.  The characters are strong and multi-layered and the dialog is funny, sarcastic and clear in the delivery.  I feel the need to finish the whole story line and both sad and glad that although this episode ended, there is another to carry me along. This is going to be a wild and crazy adventure!'
5	"a very well-composed paper with a thorough summarization of the day's top events.  love it!"
3	'needs to be more basic'
5	"I really enjoyed the character and their part in the story. I can't wait to read part 2 the suspense is killing me."
5	'Great history'
1	'Was absolutely not worth the money. I was disappointed and will most likely not purchase books by this author in the future.'
5	"I was given the honor of getting an ARC of this fabulous m/m/m book. I haven't read many of this type but WOW these three scientists make being snowed in very hot and heavy! I also feel in love with the characters themselves and was isnspired how their stories development throughout the book. Definitely a most read book!"
5	'This book is of course a classic so nothing need be said more about its contents.  My purpose in this review is to cast a positive vote for the Kindle version put out by OSNOVO.  Great job Sir.  All the links etc work fine.  The pagination is very good.  Now that this is available on a Kindle I refer to it MORE than I do my hardcopy. For this price my question would be - if you are interested in Biblical study why would you NOT get this?  Superb value for a Classic gem.'
5	"That's about all I can say Iam pleased with it. If I had known about it I coould have saved myself the price of the Armor Shield which has yet to be applied to the tablet."
5	'A nice brain teasing game that makes figure all the words you can spell with a specific number of letters. Love it.'
5	'What a fascinating fun ebook!  I enjoyed it and am sure that kids from1-8 will really get a lot of fun from reading this ebook of Oliver and Jumpy!\nI highly recommend this ebook do a five star rating and for kids ages 1-8 years of age. Such brilliant colors too.  I received this ebook for free and in exchange for being able to read it I am now giving it an honest review.  Super job Werner!  By Angela'
5	"Reason I got a kindle was to read this author's books.  I have read the first two of the Wonderland series.  The characters seem real to me as I find myself thinking of them when I'm not reading the books.  I also thought the transitions to be plausible as well as the story line"
2	'The story line is interesting and entertaining, though not sophisticated, just a light read.  But the editing errors were extremely distracting.  Please, please, please edit!!!  There were tons of spelling mistakes and even a couple mis-naming of characters that were previously introduced.  I would want to know what happens to Clara, but I cringe at the though of reading such careless writing.'
4	'Good read, very erotic, a bit over the top with the sex scenes which is the norm in this genre.  The story is actually pretty good and well written.  This e-book is worth the money.'
5	"This is a great standalone sci-fi series opener. It features Alana Lomig, a Lady Warrior and new appointee to the Queen's Guard. She meets Gared ab Einuf on the eve of her first day of service. He's a Pruxnae, a race that captures and kidnaps prospective mates. But he is handsome and charming. And he asks for one dance and promises not to kidnap her before their first kiss. She agrees to his terms and wakes up the next day in a small biosphere in the jungle of her home world, where her captor is the least of her worries."
4	'Good writing~ read. Personally had a hard time with chain of events.'
4	"it was about what I had expected it to be. no surprises, I even was aware of Laura's fate, before it happened."
1	"I thought the stories were disjointed and didn't flow. One of the authors would switch from one persons perspective to another without an indication."
5	'I tell you when I read this author I just suck it up like a my favorite drink through a straw. Every chance I got in between work and grandbaby picked this gem up. I could hardly wait to see more of the shenanigans that would unfold in the Dollhouse. I say that lovingly because I have fallen in love with some of the characters. In this one more of the layers of their personalities are revealed in between the events that unfold. Duchess is the one draws your attention the most. She has a armour of steel thanks to life,but a heart that is big as the sun with only a select few that have the key. One by choice and one by a surprise of fate. In here she will also realize that she will finally have something that she thought was elusive for her but I will say that the Captain too received the gold at the end of the rainbow when he met her. When their paths crossed they became one in a sense that in all the crap that life can throw there are those that will be given that rare thing called love. Oh I found I could also be blood thirsty too-when the "friend" reveals the truth and the skin of the viper is shed I found myself saying yes when he did not believe she would be true to her word and self. Finally Frankie, oh that girl while pleasing everyone but herself she almost lost herself, but her present called life interjected giving her a new direction to go for. Those are just some of the characters because this author has one very much chuck full of life filled with the people who live there in this world that is no easy street but really was there ever one promised any where? I would say in this one some have found what was stolen from them-faith. She shows people are going to live to fullest in what they have been given while the rules change for them as they find what was lost or stolen. This is one upcoming author that can blow my sails any day.'
4	'A very informative overview of a forgotten struggle against communism in Africa, as well of ingenious counter insurgency strategies and tactics.'
5	'Carly Philips does it again. Great character development, truly interesting story line and a great story line. Buy this book for a wonderful summer read.'
4	"I love this main character. Hetta Coffey is my kinda woman.  And if she ever really lands Jenks it'll be a miracle."
3	"Let me start by saying, I love a shifters books. I love romance, those two put together makes a really good book. I especially love a hot as sin biker/shifters. What I don't like is a weak H. Not saying what Erin went thought wasn't tragic, I personally don't cope well with characters who can't overcome. She did eventually but, I think I like stronger kick a** chicks better. The story played out well and it was truly enjoyable."
4	"4.5 Stars\nThis was a very quick and easy read and I absolutely LOVED it.\n\nI fell in love with Monroe right away. Much like Natalie, I totally judged him in the beginning and thought for sure he was going to be your everyday NA hero, a total player. He SO was not!! He was sweet and sexy and knew exactly what to do and say to help Natalie take her mind off of her douche ex-boyfriend and celebrate her birthday. I wanted to run away with him!!!\n\nI loved Natalie as much as I loved Monroe. She was SO not the nice girl she pretended to be. She's not bad either, but she definitely had a bad chick hidden inside her. I am so proud of the way she dealt with her douchey boyfriend. Even more, I loved that when she let go, she completely let go.\n\nMy only complaint about this book is that is was so short. I couldn't spend hours with Monroe and Natalie!!\n\n*I received an ARC from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review"
5	'"Wanting is a bitch, isn\'t it?"\n\nTy Callahan is furious.  After being used and abused by his last Dom, he thought he found someone who might want him.  Treasure him.  Need him and love him back the way he wants.  Quinn Taylor, he thought, was that man.\n\nUntil Quinn tossed him aside like yesterday\'s garbage when his ex Lorcan James came strolling back into the picture.  Then, Ty\'s anger has him at his breaking point.  In his mind, Lorcan was to blame.  If he were not in the picture, Quinn would be free to be Ty\'s again.  And his anger at Quinn and Lorcan builds.\n\n"You think you\'re the first person to walk away from me?"\n\nBecause how could that girly looking boy ever give Quinn what Ty knows he craves.  Lorcan can\'t give Quinn the pure gift of his pain and submission - he would break under the weight of Quinn\'s needs.  Not like Ty.  His mind made up, Ty begins a campaign against Lorcan to win Quinn back.  And it seems to be working, at least initially.  He can see the doubt in Lorcan, but Quinn is always there to make it better for him.  Be there for him.  Like no one has ever been there for Ty.  And his desire for revenge grows.\n\nBut when Blake Henderson catches Ty in a compromising position, his plan may be in jeopardy.  Until the man, the son of the rancher who tried to kill Quinn, begins to pursue him.  Thinks he may be able to give Ty the peace he craves.  And he makes Ty an offer.\n\n"One week, Ty.  Nothing heavy, and you have your safewords.  All you need to do is focus on me and my needs and be honest in  your reactions."\n\nBecause Blake is a Dom.  He can sense the struggle, the rage and jealousy that consumes and threatens Ty.  And he thinks - no, knows - he can help this bitter and broken man find a center.  Before he is lost in his fury and does something he will regret forever.\n\nWill Ty accept Blake\'s offer?  Or will his demons prove too strong for them both?  And will Blake find redemption for his tragic past with Ty?\n\nSJD Peterson has delivered a stunning character study of two men haunted by the losses in their lives who may find a chance at redemption.  This third book in the "Whispering Pines Ranch" series starts with the dull embers of Ty\'s hurt, and builds to the full inferno of what happens when love becomes obsession.  I was awed by the depth of the pain, only hinted at when we met Ty In "Quinn\'s Need".  How the layers upon layers of hurt heaped on him left Ty on the precipice of doing something horrific.\n\nAnd then we meet Blake, all solid and sure of himself.  We think.  And as he takes Ty in hand and soothes the flames of hate and hurt in him, we then get to see the broken man living behind the hero.  And lose our hearts one more time to one of Ms. Peterson\'s sharply drawn and lovingly crafted men.\n\nI\'m not sure there are many writers in the genre out there right now who take such time and care in building their men from the ground up.  Make them complete and fully realized, and force me react so honestly and so deeply to them.  Quinn, Lorcan, Jesse, Ty, now Blake.  I feel almost guilty feasting on the buffet of richly imagined men.\n\nAlmost, I say.  But don\'t tell Ms. Peterson.  Let it be our little secret and maybe we\'ll get Jesse\'s story...\n\nTom'

5	'My sixteen year old son introduced me to the Night Vale podcasts several months ago.  I totally love them and understand why my son loves them too.  I listened to all of them before getting the book.  My husband asked me if the book would make sense to people who have not listened to the podcasts.  I think it could be read/listened to without having heard the podcasts, but you would not have a lot of the background information and it is better if you have been following the podcasts.  I got the audio book and the physical book and listened to most of it and read some of it.  I think I like the audio better than the written book. I love the narrator and I think he adds something to the story that is just not the same without him.  The story is a bit like the old Twilight Zone TV series in that many inexplicable and creepy things go on in Night Vale, but are seen as perfectly normal for the most part by the people who live there.  This story follows Jackie Fierro (I have a cat named Fierro - had him and his name long before this podcast and book came out though) who is the perpetually 19 year old pawn shop owner and Dianne Crayton whose son Josh changes his physical form on a regular basis.  Their lives become entwined as they both need to find The Man in The Tan Jacket who everyone forgets and Troy, who proves to be quite elusive.  I thought the plot twists in the book were quite interesting and I enjoyed it very much!  I hope they keep up with the podcasts and perhaps write another book - or maybe it could make an intriguing movie.'
5	"This is the fifth book in this series and they just get better. I love the writing style, the characters and the stories. This is such a great series I can't believe I'm just now reading it."
5	"I lost 5 pounds the first week!!  I've never done that and I'm an avid dieter  I'm feeling so good."
1	'If this book is not free you paid to much. cut copy and paste from links you can find online'
3	'Good, brief summary of the Pacific War. however, the book is full of spelling and grammatical errors. It needs a good editing.'
5	'The instructions in the green books are heart felt and wonderful.'
5	'I loved this book so much! Nicole won me over with her sassy attitude. Victor was such a great addition to the "Contreras Men." Sexy story. Really great writing. I recommend!!'
4	'Another fine read. Good action and excitement. Lost a few good men on this mission, but got the job done. This one was a bit more predictable then previous books but still good.'
2	"I chose 2 stars because there is the interest it generates to see what is Sarah going to do. She really doesn't want to continue as the Flame, she just wants to go home, but keeps on trying to do the job she is called to do. But the brutallity is gross and I decided I would not enjoy the series."
1	"Don't waste your money. This is a pamphlet, not a book. And it contains information that is readily available FOR FREE from any of a number of websites. This is nothing but the most very basic of options information."
3	'Your book are getting to be cooky cutter books same thing we every time just Change of name. I wish you expand your stories & kind of inter mingle to be more interesting'
4	"I found the book enjoyable and fairly interesting, if a bit predictable. However, I found lines where there were clear errors in formatting/grammar where whole sentences were not spaced, sandwiching words together in several areas, which was a bit distracting. I liked the central theme of the book however, and how each central character developed through the story. On the other hand,I think some of the secondary characters could have used a bit more development or background information (such as Taylor, Rhea's best friend) instead of randomly popping in and out of the story line."
5	"This is the best book of its kind that I have ever read. Love/hate and angst with sizzling chemistry between the leads. I haven't come across better sex scenes anywhere. Both the way they happen and the way they are written is what makes them so hot. I like the build up to it. The antagonism between them isn't based on repressed attraction but rather is caused by assumptions about each other. It is a confluence of events that sparks the attraction between them. The change between them is only physical, and it doesn't magically erase their problems. The pace is realistic, and the author spends time developing the characters. This is one that is good enough to read more than once. I am looking forward to more books by this talented author."
5	"Title said it all .but ending needed more\nAnd they should appear in more then the last book of the emporer's edge"
5	'Matt is so good at what he does but, the Blood King seems to be unstoppable. He can do things others can not. But, he has the ability to attack us on our own soil, the United States. Something no one has done except in WWII. What are we to do to stop this man? How will we survive?'
5	'A great read. Very honest and insightful. Hussey gives a personal view of the highs and lows of his career.'
4	'I read this on Kindle unlimited. I like it a lot more than I thought I would. I really have a thing for possessive and protective heros and sweet innocent heroines. The supporting characters were awesome and pretty  well fleshed out. I will be reading the rest of the series.'
5	'Captures you immediately! Even though it is a short story, it has full and rich characterization, fast paced action and a compelling story.  Loved it!'
5	'Good read! Michael is a great story teller.'
5	'Good book. I loved every message but I needed something more entertaining and longer to read. I would recommend though'
1	'Boring'
5	'Very cute, easy read.  I am a TA and it kept me guessing which cruise line!'
5	"He never judged her on what she didn't  have and that made the story even better. The fact he and his father bonded was wonderful."
3	"These short stories,were  very short,and sweet..if you have a moment...that's all it will take...Just don't look for a typical ending..too many question left, not answered... anyway..Enjoy!"
5	"Excellent tool for the diligent student who desires to dig deeper in the Orthodox Teachings. As a devotional it will take you through the Old, New Testaments, Psalms and Proverbs.  It contains a wealth of Hebrew Words with phonetic spellings in English. Reader is equipped with original words found in Hebrew writings, never a watered down connotation of the word. God's word is pure and should be preserved as inspired by the Ruach Ha Kodesh. This devotional contains multiple sermons via tube."
5	'Amazing characters and story lines.'
5	'This was a truly thought provoking read. I found it especially relevant as I have been a witness to the shift to a technology driven society.\nGrowing up in the 80\'s, I saw technology slowly enter our daily lives until it took over.\nI often wonder as a parent in 2015 how I would cope without my "tether" aka my smart phone where I can contact my children at any time.\nThe concept of us being a global person rather than one member of a geographic community did not exist just 20 years ago. I can write a blog and influence people across the world.\nThis book was very well written. It really caused me to reflect on how society has changed and whether I am too technology dependent.\n\n*I was given the opportunity to review this book in exchange for an honest review. All opinions are my own.'
5	'One of my favorites in this series. I could see myself enjoying a MC novel, but an MC where everybody was a werewolf was outside my comfort zone. Candace makes this work.  She sets up paranormal rules that are realistic and makes the relationship between Duke and Gen seem very possible and hot. Gen may be the sexiest realtor Ive ever read.'
4	"A fun read that keeps you wondering what is going to happen next. The story draws you in, and won't let you out until you have read it cover to cover. I enjoyed this book and am looking forward to the sequel."
4	"Definitely a fun read - I love bear shifters :). Even though there's not a lot of depth to the book for a short read there was enough to make it an enjoyable read :). Christian and Vincent are great together"
1	'Wtf is all I can say. The ending was a huge disappointment.  Especially compared to the rest of the series.'
3	"Not the most gripping thriller ever written.  The hype that you shouldn't read it before going to bed or you won't sleep is way off base.  The sex scenes were way too graphic for a so called mystery novel. The characters were ok, but not well rounded enough."
5	"Great read, I've felt as if I've been stuck in a rut with no direction. This helped me realize what is important to me and what I need to work on to grow as an individual. Lots of great information here, I will probably read it again, highly recommended!!"
5	"As always, outstanding, throughly enjoyable, and sad it's over but looking forward to the next book.  Keep them coming please!!!"
5	"I have been patiently waiting for who held the key to Micah's heart and it was SO worth the wait - I can't get enough of Sable's books and have read them all - I reread them because I am reading so fast because they are so good I miss some things sometimes - her books never let me down and I love owning all of them - way to go Sable !!!!!! - xoxo"
3	'Great story line, love the characters!  I would love to see much more detail as these story lines mingle.  This is the best Amish Days yet.'
5	'I love that Esi got her own story!\nFrom book one,Adam seems like such a jerk! In this story, I started liking him little by little, until finally, I loved him lol.\nBeautiful writing, fabulous character development, and hot and steamy love scenes! I love it!'
5	'I was so glad Amazon had this book! It has always been my go to when I need encouragement from the Word for a specific issue.  I highly recommend!!'
5	'Tiana Laveen did it again!  I love Part I and Part II of this book  Laveen is such a great writer.  I love Saint and Xenia because the two characters represent true love.  It is so hard for me to put books aside without completely reading them if they are written by Tiana Laveen.\n\n#I Reader'
5	'Hot and sizzling !'
5	'This book is unique. I loved the lessons learned by the female lead character as she grew from meeting the main male character. I loved his persistence and sense of humor. I would definitely look for more books from this author.'
5	'Fast-paced, witty, sexy and entertaining, this second installment in The Mandrake Company series is a delightful way to spend an afternoon.'
5	'It has been a  really long time since I read a book of this nature. I really liked it and am glad they made another to follow it.it was a really nice change.'
5	'Absolutely loved all 3 of these books! Great action and I hate that they had to end. LOVED THEM!!!'
5	"Quick read with an enjoyable steamy plot! I can't wait to read more. The book was the perfect length for a long car ride. I only wish I had the rest of the series downloaded for the ride home."
2	'I tried to finish this book,but GAVE UP. Story was too similar to other books. Did not even care for what I assume would have been main character. Poor little rich girl!'
5	'Cara and Able make a great couple.  they were both scared of getting hurt by the other.  once they fingered out that they were in love everything eels worked it self out'
4	'A good read one worth the effort. It however left me wanting a little more. Yet what is said is great and gives yuou a lot to think about.'
5	'I first read this book back in 2001 when I suddenly lost my hearing and was considering cochlear implants.  At the time, I chose to go with a hearing aid, because even after reading this book (among others), I didn\'t feel the CI technology was where I wanted it to be.  This year, I finally went ahead and did it in one ear, and coincidentally just found this book in storage after moving.  Reading it again (post surgery but pre activation), it is still completely relevant and is incredibly helpful, especially knowing that in just a few weeks, I will be "hearing" again too.  No matter how many people you talk to these days that have a CI, this book is still helpful as you walk through every step of the process with her and she\'s feeling exactly the same things you are.'
5	"4.5 Dirty Rotten Dark Stars!!!\nWhile this series started out like a bad car accident that you couldn't look away from, I have grown to admire Faye.  She finally finds out what it's like to be 'normal' in this addition.  My heart was all over the place for her from the beginning where I was sobbing for what she lost and then breaking when she kept comparing herself to the new colleagues she was surrounded by. She thought so little of herself.  I was glad to see resolution to that aspect of the story.\n\nRhett.......that boy was on my last nerve during the whole book.  Talk about wishy washy.  I felt bad for both Sarah and Faye.  I'm thinking we will see a totally different Rhett in the last installment.  After that ending, Filthy 6 can't come soon enough.\n\nIf you like dark romance with quite a lot of taboo this is a great series to add to your collection!"
5	'I thoroughly enjoyed reading this novel.  It is a clean and very interesting romantic story.  There is no violence or sexual content in this book and it was a pleasure to read.'
5	'It was a great read. I learned alot about many people. It was a lot of fun to share.'
4	"She covers everything in this book. Talks about good fats and bad fats which I think is very important, she also talks about protein sources and the good carbs. The best Part is the essential vitamins and minerals and the 50 pointers for success. I'm always trying to eat healthy meals and this books is helping me a lot. I recommend it to everybody. Thanks!"
5	"Love it can't wait to read part 2. It's a brotherly love. Great book keep up the good work yay."
4	'I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It has everything: Action, love, aliens, super powers. It was an all around fantastic read. I had trouble putting it down. So much so that I finished it in one evening. I highly recommend this book for anyone who enjoys science fiction.'
4	'atmospheric, not documentary, history but highly evocative of the daily life of a free people'
5	"This was my first Jess Williams book but it won't be my last.  I thought it was an entertaining book reminiscent of Lonesome Dove."
5	'This is a great start to what I know to be a wonderful series. The write is good and the characters are great. The on sad part is it is so short. I need to know more!!!!'
5	"Amazing Story. The character's Liam and Rachelle had chemistry. Liam is a billionaire who wants a trophy wife and he wants Rachelle who is a model. The ending was good."
3	"What You Own is in first person POV that alternates between the two main characters with flashbacks written in a present tense, diary style that works quite well. The author utilises an almost conversational style. It's very much like you're listening to Ryan and Adam tell you their stories. I did find the short back and forth point of views, especially in the first few chapters, a bit too much. It made it difficult to really get a handle on either character. This did ease up somewhat with longer time given to each character before switching POV and I ended up getting a better sense of the characters. I think some of the problem I had with the POV changes was that they weren't a break or a scene change but carried directly on from where the other character left off with the events happening and I found that a little jarring. That both point of views were told in first person didn't help because I found myself being pulled out of the story repeatedly as I had to keep remembering whose head we were in.\n\nI can totally see how another person might love it, but this story was merely okay for me. The first person alternating POVs distanced the story and I had no emotional investment in the characters. I mean, it was kind of like hearing about someone I didn't know. While I wished them all the best and hoped things turned out well for them, it was in a vague kind of general way that I would have for anyone. It wasn't a personal, fingers crossed, I really want good things to happen to my friends kind of wish. And being unfamiliar with Rent and its music, all of those references went right over my head. It had its sweet moments and, even though it didn't quite work for me, may well be worth giving it a try for yourself.\n\nRead the full review at Live Your Life, Buy The Book"
5	'So far I am really into this graphic novel. The illustrations are freaking fantastic and I love the story. Would highly recommend especially if you are into steampunk.'
5	'I liked this book a lot, I just wish that there was more to it. :-( I really did not want it to end.'
5	'Secrets delivers a strong thrilling suspense story.  This is the finale of the Secrets Series.  Larissa and her hitman Jason continue on the run.  They continue to outwit and outplay the secret group, the Trust.  Now they are looking for Jasons dad to find out his involvement with the Trust.  When Larissa meets his dad, she finds out where he gets his strength and wit from.\n\nI really enjoy the action packed drama and sizzling suspense.  Jason and Larissa are so well suited to each other.  It is amazing that they met when he was sent to kill her!'
4	"This books shares a typical boyfriend and girlfriend story break up story. Stories such as this are all over the TV, news, magazines everywhere. Im at the point of my life where Im starting to believe that there are no more women or men out there with good moral and values anymore. Having a family is the only thing I think about now a days. The idea in this story was to become a family and not have the stress of focusing on each other but focusing on the baby, which is where the co-parenting idea comes in from the plot of this story. I don't know if I would be willing to do such a thing but I guess for the babys sake and the fact that it seems no one is willing to have a normal faithful relationship these days, maybe the idea of co-parenting is not so bad idea after all.. I guess once you all read this story you will come up with your own outlook on this co-parenting issue. So purchase the book and enjoy. I really enjoyed reading this book and learning so much about the couple in the story and co-parenting."
5	'Delighfully written'
4	'Jacobs Christmas Dream by: Darlene Franklin\nJacobs Christmas Dream is part of the Christmas Mail Order Collect. This is such a sweet story of faith, love and inspiration. Can Becky learn to let go of her determination and learn to follow what God has planned for her life? This story hit home with me. Reminded me that I need to stop being so determined and accept what God has planned for my life. Excellent story. 5 stars!'
1	"This book was an incredible disappointment. Even on the simplest level, it makes absolutely no sense, doesn't tell a story, and is not engaging in any way to a child . A baby animal makes its sound (moo, quack, oink, woof, meow, etc) and the adult animal says dada - to the baby animal. Yes, one word on each page with a picture and still can't make any sense. Instead of entertaining or educating, it implies that every baby has a loving daddy, which unfortunately is cruel and insensitive to some children. It's just so stupid, I'm returning it. It's not only bad, it's a rip off."
3	'This was an ok read.. I expected to read more about the disease but alas, not. In some areas the book was a little far-fetched. It did hold my interest but it did not have that "wow" factor I was hoping for. Thanks to NetGalley, the author and the publisher for the ARC of this book in return for my honest review.'
5	"Love,hate ! Action packed its such a wonderful! Book. I've always loved werewolves since I was a kid! This story is one of the best ever !!!"
5	'Exactly what I wanted'
5	'Omg. I loved this book. Already bought book 2. I was hooked from the beginning.'
3	'could not get this to download...'
2	'I just started juicing and was looking for some book to introduce me to it. There must be above 50 recipes in it .But not anywhere near in depth. For example I was looking for a recipe to mix the parsnips with and I believe there was only one recipe for that. It was lacking even for a novice. I did discover one thing while I juice though if you add one red pepper (skinned) it makes almost any vegetable juice palatable!'
5	'A story that rings true in the telling. Kids visit an old geezer who tells them of flying a P38 in WWII.'
5	"I've always been a fan of brain teasers and this book certainly didn't disappoint! There was a great range of puzzles from easy to difficult and most of them I had never heard before. Looking forward to reading more in the future and sharing these with my family who enjoy them just as much as I. I received this product for free in return for my honest review."
4	"3.5 Stars\nRuthie Knox is an author I never have to worry about if I'm going to enjoy her books for not. Even though this series is not my favorite by her, I still enjoyed it a great deal.\n\nI read this series all at once. I don't know how often it was released as a serial. That may have actually worked better. It took me quite awhile to actually get into the book. While it's extremely well written, it just seemed to drag on in the beginning. I didn't feel the hook till probably the end of chapter 5. And the book felt long. I love long books, but this was much slower paced. Again, this may have worked better as a serial, with breaks.\n\nThat all, being said, I liked the plot, the characters, and the side characters. I felt incredibly sad for both of them at times. This book made me mad, sad, and laugh."
3	"This book is written around the sex scenes and I don't mind that, but I need a little more plot. I found myself skimming paragraphs and pages to find out what happens to the characters even though I know there is a 'Happily Ever After.' It was a good plot, but both the plot and characters were shallow. I can work around unbelievable plots, because this IS fiction, but I need better character development and a better written book.  I may try another from this author, later."
5	"I would recommended this book to anyone who wants to know the truth. Seeing is proof to believing plus you probably wasn't shown this in school."
5	"This read has drawn me right in from front to back!  I am extremely fascinated by Raegan's every word in this particular piece of work because it captures every emotion that real life entails.  There is darkness, there is sadness, there is doom, there is isolation, but overall, there is hope. Raegan expresses his emotion allegorically as well as literally.......and I love it! I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for emotions as they occur.  Short and to the point."
5	"I love that she went back home and found out somethings didn't change.  I wish I had read the first two books of this series.  I can't wait to read about the others."
5	'I finished reading Luis\' book and came out of it with what "I never knew!"\n\nWhat special souls are these kids, and what special families are needed to bring them beyond rocking in a corner, as they have so much more potential. BUT so little is known and there is no cure; there is only hope, love, and the patience to see those through.  I believe that had I not read this book, I\'d not have known what was going on, or I should say NOT going on behind the eyes of an autistic child..\n\nLuis, how kind and selfless of you to bare your soul in telling us the good, the bad, and the ugly that you have and are going through, and how wonderful that through all the strife, you come out of it seeing the good, the beauty, the love!  You truly are a special dad!  And I believe you couldn\'t have been that special dad without the help and support of the rest of your immediate family.\n\nThanks for the tears and the laughter I got to experience while reading!  You\'d bring me to tears and then crack me up!!\n\nI hope that your book helps your friends and your family understand about autism, as well, and that other dads like you feel freer to feel, talk about, and to fight for their kids. Unfortunately, autism is so prevalent now; they need to find the cause and cure!\n\nBless you and your family, Luis!  One doesn\'t need to have an autistic child to be enlightened by Luis\' writing..one just needs to care.'
5	"I loved this book could not put it down. Jericho finally finds the one for him. Can't wait for the next book to be out."
5	"This is a lovely story and a great illustration of the fact that a few years can make a big difference in maturity and perspective. Kalli and Walker both needed to do some growing up in order to make their relationship into something meaningful. I really enjoyed this book. In fact, when I finished it I bought several more of Ms. McLinn's books."
5	"It's refreshing to read a UF with a male lead.  When I read and write I see the story in my head like a movie and I have to say, Sacred Bloodlines would make a kick ass movie.  I'd definitely pay to see it in theaters."
4	'Now that we are"post second term election"perhaps we can get to what really matters. Go Mr President. Give it all you\'ve got.'
4	"I don't know why this book/story has such low reviews because it's actually pretty sweet. And it's a twist on the normal animal shapeshifter with one being a demon shapeshifter. I would have loved to read more of this story."
5	'Another great book expounding on the teachings of the Early Church Fathers.'
2	'This is the most maddening book that I have ever read. I wanted to love it because the plot is very good, but the writing itself is poor at best. Choppy sentences, modern day ideas imposed on historical characters, arguments that started and then ended for no reason, modern day phrases and words, too many details given in some areas and not enough in others, and this is just the beginning of my complaints. Just because some people say "I declare!", doesn\'t mean it should be used in every other sentence. All in all, a very frustrating book.'
5	'Another wonderful book by Sawyer Bennett. This book struck close to my heart in that my father had a similar cancer. Hope, strength, courage, caring and love are predominant players in "Garrett." A subject that could have been sad was instead uplifting and well...hot! Yes, your life doesn\'t have to stop with this diagnosis.'
5	'I have read three books written by Billi Tiner and this one is my favorite. The story moves along very nicely and kept me interested throughout the entire book.'
4	'Good easy reading book.  Kept my interest. Would recommend to others.'
4	'A nice easy read about the basic options for investing with some recommendations from the author. This book is perfect for those just now looking to get their feet wet, however, if you have already researched about many of the different types of investments, investment vehicles, and other intros to investments, then this book will more than likely reinforce a lot of what you already learned.  The lighthearted approach that the author takes makes this intro to investing book more entertaining than other intros out there.'
3	'Paranormal romance and very steamy. The elfin king wants heirs to his kingdom, but he is not immune to a little wooing of his human wife to go with the sex.  Not like any paranormal romance I have read before.  I would like to have seen a little my more back bone from our heroine and bravery.  All and all, it was an entertaining read.'
4	"A dog eat dog mafia true story . A very smart and tough man . I don't blame him for what he did ."
4	'I do not have a color Kindle, so the pictures were dark and difficult to see.  The story was cute with a good message for little ones, but I would not recommend it to those without color, especially if their little ones cannot yet read.'
5	'I love the thoughtful reporting of ProPublica.'
4	'I know the shopping can be a illness.\nThis book explains what you do for help, what you avoid\nWe know, the shopping, to feel good, very good, when we had a bad day.\nBut more shopping can be problem, for me, for you for our family.\nThis book gives to we a lot information. It is very good book'
3	'I received this book for a honest review. I liked the story line between Lucas and charlee but it was confusing as the setting kept changing. Did Charlee have one or two brothers her best friend name was interchanged. Other wise it was a good book'
2	'The story line is fine, the characters developed fairly well, but the grammar, misplaced lines of text, and spelling errors make this book difficult to read. Although the book has potential, it needs lots of editing work. I could not read even a quarter of the book before I had to put it down - bad grammar gives me a headache. There is one passage that makes no sense at all where the characters are in the forest and the writer begins to describe something from a prior scene in the book (3 pages earlier). The plot is a bit scattered in the beginning and the misplaced lines just added to the confusion.\n\nWould not recommend.'
4	"I just discovered R. J. Lewis.  I've loved all the books by the author, especially Borden.  I would recommend this read!"
3	'Basic Picture Book. However there is only ONE time that Horse and Hen counted and it was not even to ten.\nIt is repetitious I will give it that one.'
2	"Why break a story into 2-3 parts....SPOILER: this, too, has a cliffhanger....when you could have 1 nice length story, unified and memorable?  Here's the thing, I can borrow books using Kindle Unlimited, however, those stories that are COMPLETE, good, and that capture my attention I flat out buy AFTER reading them.  I had to go back to book one to remember the story/characters.  Then partially into chapter 1 I remembered why I was unhappy with part one of this story, only to be met with the same theme, cliffhanger, sense that the story was missing something, and another abrupt ending.\n\nWill I read the next installment?  Doubtful. As for my rating, the book isn't complete rubbish, but definitely not great either."
5	"It's a great good book can wait to read more about Kate, Mac and Nick. I thought it was excited and sometimes sad at some parts of the book. It's  worth reading again."
5	'Do not read before going to sleep!'
5	"I was given an ARC in exchange for an honest review.\n\nI love Stacey's writing and you can add this story to my list of favorites.  It's a no strings attached relationship from the beginning that obviously develops into something more.  Both Sarah and Lynx have traumatic pasts and are afraid to let one another in. But eventually spending so much time together the walls around their hearts start to break down and their pasts start to unfold.  There is so much angst in this story, tissues are advisable.  This book will grip you from the beginning and keep you engaged until the end.  Loved, loved this book!"
3	'Found some good  points  . Words kinds appealing.\nKinda had me anxious to start now  .Ready to try it. .'
2	"This book was a run along sentence it was the same thing over and over make up break up over and over so with that being said i won't be reading part 2"
4	'Fun read.  Enjoy how each book has a very different\nsetting.  The author makes it easy to visualize what\nthe characters are enduring.'
5	'Another McKinney man to fall in love with, and of course the woman of his affection. This book was amazing and beautiful. Claudia can write a great hot romance with all the feels'
5	"MMA MAGIC 'King'\n\nIn this story we are introduced to a world of fighting, not only for titles, but for love and freedom. Freedom from the past. In Chynas case shes fighting abandonment issues with an ex who was more interested in drugs and his next high than the woman at his side fighting for him daily.\n\nThrough this ex-relationship shes learned about dishonesty, cheating, lying and being used and abused. Not physically, but emotionally shes damaged and doesnt believe in love or relationshipsat least not past one-night variety. Shes not looking for forever when she meets Jace, or in the MMA world known as King.\n\nKingJace, is just as damaged from his pastonly not from a romantic relationship, but from parental relationships. A mom who only wants her sons for what they can get her...she is an addict, and love isn't anything she shares with her children. Jace has a brother, Jacob whos evil to his core, uses his brother for funds and uses Jaces love and loyalty to him against him for his wants and needs.\n\nThis couple is enamored with each other upon first sightChyna is Kings biggest supporter in the ring...where there he is the King. That is his world and hes in charge there. She goes to his fights religiously, even not knowing him personally she is his biggest supporter. She likes to see before fight interviews and pick the biggest jerks and makes sure they're not on her approved list of winners. Jace the King is her dream. A dream shes determined to keep just that. Only her best-friend is dating her best-friend, which means inevitablythey meet. When they do, she cant get herself out of the fan fog, and has to bring herself back out, she is consistently getting lost in her day-dreams and meeting him hasn't changed any of that.\n\nKing Jace, wants Chyna, at first just for a romp between the sheets, only a group weekend away lands these two into spending a lot of time alone. Their attraction turns to friendship, that when they get home leads to Jace realizing he will do anything to make Chyna his. Chyna also realizes that shes his as well, and begs him not to abandon her as everyone else in her life has. Thats right, Chyna has been abandoned by everyone, including those who should love her the most.\n\nThis story reminds you love is worth the fight. Keep fighting for love with Jace and Chyna as we watch their romance bloom and they learn to trust, love and fight for what they want.\n\nI have to say, MMA is not my genre. I know nothing on the subject, but Sapphire never made me feel that way. She makes you feel in the moment and as if you are an expert in the subject. Thank you for sharing the love of your husbands sport and introducing us to a world most of us know nothing about. Your way of genre knowledge astounds meThank you Sapphire. 5 star review and two thumbs up!"

Social services wants to split them up so Harlie makes a home for them. She works and keeps house while Angel goes to school but it was apparent that Angel has deep psychological problems.

Family is not just created by those we are related to but by the people that we love and trust and share ourselves with.\n\nThanks to the author for a copy of this book.  All opinions are my own.  This is my first book by Laura Drake but I have already started ordering some of her earlier books because I enjoyed this one so much."
5	'Great guide to public speaking, lots of simple yet effective tactics.'
5	'I love this author so much.  Everything she writes is amazing.  This book is another superb addition to the list of fantastic books by Megan.  Read them all!!!'
4	"Very good book! Wish the ending would have had a little more detail about the family and what's gunna happen next but other wise a very good book!"
5	'I loved this book and it was even better than the first, which was great as well. Amber really shined in this one and from the first line, it was non stop action.'
2	'A glimpse into online dating from one persons personal experience.  One dimensional and not very interesting.  There are much more interesting reads out there.'
5	"And so the story continues and pulls me in even further!!\n\nAll 3 books have been very well written and the story line has been beautifully executed. Each book leaves you wanting more....there's an urgency to devour the books to find out what's gonna happen but at the same time you don't want the story to end!\n\nUsually when reading, it's the main characters that imbed themselves in my head and heart ....but in these books I am invested in ALL the characters. The author has done a marvelous job of bringing all the characters to life in a big way and I find myself connecting with all of them on some level. Of course I have my favorites....Tanner, Tanner, Tanner....and then there's Abby who is the kind of heroine that I thoroughly enjoy reading about, strong and capable but tender and emotional also.\n\nThis book brought a lot of answers and understanding to questions and events that took place in the first 2 books. I absolutely loved that these books were unpredictable...about the time you think you had something pieced together, it would take you in a different direction. The book, for me, was very easy to follow.... Just not predictable!\nI will say that at the end of this book my heart was broke and I hated having to come back to reality with that feeling ....sooo I will be waiting, not so patiently and with a broken heart, for the next installment!!(less)"
2	'The information was too basic.  There was not enough info in the book to make it worth my time.  Not at all interesting at all.'
5	"This series is a compelling, complex new take on the possibilities of human and alien kind.  Couldn't put it down. I'll be waiting for the next installment."
5	'Wonderful illustrations and a great little book. I love that there\'s a good mix of boys doing "girl" things and girls doing "boy" things. Anyone can be anything they want to be- boys can play tea party, and girls can be super heroes. Love this book, I think this will quickly become one of our favorites.'
5	"I sat down to read this with the intention of just reading a few pages when I could find time.  Then, I just couldn't stop.  I had to see what happened on the next page and then the next.  It's a fun romp with it's own unique twists and characters one would definitely love to see again!  At the end....well...I had some questions.  Your imagination will take you there.  Hmmmm....I wonder who could star in this story as a movie?"
5	'Excellent i am so glad I discovered this author, this book was well written, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. These days it is so hard to find a good book without all the explicit sex scenes that when I find one that is well written I am overjoyed. I highly recommend this book to any who clean regency romances .'
3	'Good story about the beginning of a family line that will live and build Australia.  Good characters and a good flow to the story.'
5	'I cant say how many times we have made these recipies since purchase and they are so easy to make your own as well'
5	"The third installment of The Chronicles of Midgard was by far my favorite of the books. I loved seeing Maeja's character strengthen as she grew into her role as the Valkyrie. Seeing her having to wade through diplomatic relationships as she seeks alliances was very interesting for me; her backround as a Jarl's daughter helped but even with that it was a very tricky situation. I enjoyed seeing the interplay between the various ambassadors and feeling out the international relations in her world during that portion of the book.\n\nI'm now going to sit here and get impatient until book 4 is published."
4	"There seems to be some very valuable information here, but the writing style, excessive redundancy of various points, and what seems to be (but isn't) circular thinking, makes it a challenging endeavor. All in all, however, the good doctor makes some valid points, in my opinion. I would suggest, however, that this manuscript be proofed and edited, since it will not only increase reader comprehension, but it might also pack a significant enough 'punch' that the world will actually listen."
5	"I've followed the blog for awhile.  Today I read the one story available on Kindle.  It is great.  Well written, not sacarhine but truthful.  A wonderful wonderful story that talks about black people I've known all my life.  Congratulations and as soon as I write this I will buy the book."
5	"First off why are there no sexy gingers as leading men in novels? Liam was H.O.T\nWhen we first met Liam it was in Dylan & Sky's story, Liam was with Honey (I had some serious Honey Boo Boo flash backs everytime her name is mentioned) Our story begins with Liam actually thinking of marrying the god awful gold digger! Poor Liam!!! Around Christmas time pics leak of Honey with another man, So Liam goes home to have a Welsh Christmas with his family, when he gets home he discovers a family friend and her daughter living there with his family.\nCerys and her daughter Ella are thrown out of their home by her boyfriend and Ella's dad Craig (aka the douche bag) Sparks start to fly between Cerys and Liam, and Liam is just amazing with Ella. Something happens that calls Liam away (band business) Liam doesn't want to leave but he has no choice. The the jerk shows up and convinces Cerys to being Ella home with promises of change. Flash forward, Liam actually attempts to marry Honey, coming to his senses and leaving her the day of the wedding (totally loved this part) and finally wakes up to realize his heart belongs with Cerys and Ella. Rushing back home to Cerys and Ella, Craig causes so much drama for them and pulls one stunt that I am shocked that Liam didn't kill him for. The guys in the band make a couple appearances in the story, some awesome news about Dylan and Sky, and it seems that Jem might actually be sober???? and I swear Bryn is hiding something :)"

5	"Once again Jen Frederick has me swooning for another member of the Woodland Series and this time, Finn O'Malley will capture our hearts in UNREQUITED.\n\nWe all remembered from the previous books that Finn O'Malley was the guy who made his living flipping houses. But when his father recently passed away, a big construction project of his father was left for him to complete. Finn is completely devastated that he lost his father. Not only did he lose the man he admired and looked up to, but he lost his biggest supporter. Reeling from the loss, he turned to alcohol and random sex to fill in the void and numbness. What Finn didn't expect was to be consumed with lust and feelings for Winter Donovan after their one hot, sexy, passionate, and steamy night.\n\nWinter Donovan is the woman who had always had a crush on her older sister's ex-boyfriend. Finn was the one guy that stole Winter's heart. She always wanted him and when that opportunity to be with Finn for one night, she couldn't turn down the chance. And what a hot steamy sexual night it was. That one night changed the course and relationship for Finn and Winter. The lines of friendship blurred when they both finally saw that their attractions and feelings for one another was all consuming. So when Winter finally found happiness and love with Finn, will her sister Ivy make her feel guilty for pursuing Finn? When it comes to choosing, will she love or family?\n\nUnrequited by Jen Frederick was one of those reads that was devoured in one sitting. It is a story that truly showcases the growth of characters. I loved that Jen allowed readers to see the beautiful transformation of Winter Donovan as she discovers her inner strength and learns to stand up for herself. I applaud Jen for writing a heroine that is Asian because it makes this romance tale so modern and realistic. It was a breathe of fresh air to finally have some romantic diversity.\n\nAs always, Jen Frederick's writing and storytelling always leaves me smiling and wanting more. The Woodland series is a great series to get lost in and fall in love with swoon-worthy book boyfriends. And be prepared to get your hearts captured by Finn and Winter. Their story will remind us all to never give up on true love and sometimes you must learn to stand up on your own.\n\n~Michelle of Four Chicks Flipping Pages"
1	"Why charge for the fans to know what order to read his books. I've bought every book Blake has written. Is there not any loyalty to the fans? Shame on you Amazon!!!"
5	"I loved this book. I really didn't expect to because it started out a little slow , but soon found myself carried away by Elmo's experiences & escapades. I laughed out loud and at the end got a frog in my throat and tears on my eyes. I'm glad I read this book first as the author suggested. I can hardly wait to start the next one. Another thi ng I came away with was gratitude that my church keeps our congregations small  my church family is very important to me and I know I wouldn't thrive in a church as big as the one in this book."
4	'What a totally fun read about a close community of witches, and a great introduction to characters I hope will appear in future books.'
5	'OMG!!!! I swear if I could just read 1 page a day, I would\'ve.  Once I started reading, I never wanted to stop... even to sleep LOL ....  It was very descriptive & explicit, kept me wanting more, & wish it would\'ve lasted longer. This book definitely made me keep saying "Just one more chapter each time I finished another chapter"... I SOOOO cannot wait until I can start on the 2nd book!!!'
3	'I really enjoyed reading this book. It was an easy, fun read about 2 childhood friends that goes to Vegas, get drunk & wake up married.  I liked the honesty between Lovely and Drake. They truly talked to each other! Cant tell you how much I appreciated that. That removed the need for miscommunication that leads to drama and breakup in the story. They had to figure their way through the next steps. Do they stay together or divorce?  Good easy read!!'
5	'I love mc reads and this one jumped to the top with my long time favorites. Already have book 2 and starting it jow.'
5	'The book was a great read especially since it fills in a lot of background of the main character in the Empire Corps series.  The book covers Edward stalk years from is childhood to his first deployment in the Corps.  It is a stand alone book but it easlily could have been a prequaled to the series.  I highly recommend the book if you enjoy he series or if you want to sample the series.'
5	"When Grady Sinclair was a teenager his father made sure that he knew he or any of his siblings wasn't going to amount to much. Well he proved his father wrong. After his drunk of a father died after the dreaded Sinclair annual Christmas party, Grady renounced Christmas and parties in general. Moving to a small town in hopes of keeping his reclusive billionaire self to his house he never expected to have to go to another Christmas event again. That is until he met the director of the local community center.\n\nEmily Ashworth has failed! She failed herself, she failed the town, but most of she failed the kids. Having all the money in the centers account stolen by the man she was dating she knows she has to go to the one person she fears will say no. Sucking up all her courage she goes to Grady Sinclair. After literally falling at the feet of this beautiful man, she musters the courage to ask, but what she doesn't expect was for him to make a deal. Teach him to love Christmas again by living with him or no money. What's a girl to do?\n\nMy opinion...\nThe only think wrong with this book is that it was a Novella and not a full length book. I loved this book! J.S. Scott was a new author for me and I can't wait to read more from her. You can't help but love the lonely reclusive Grady and the fact that he flipped his old man the bird by proving what he was good at, just made his life a little better. Though he does feel like something is missing until Emily comes into his life. I liked how she was not made out to be a tiny little thing but a real woman and that she could capture the attention of this gorgeous man.\n\nThe writing while rushed because of it being a novella, was virtually flawless. I found very few writing mistakes and I did like how the other siblings were brought into the story gradually. I would have like to have seen a little more buildup to the ex coming back but all in all I thoroughly enjoyed this book."
5	"One of the VERY BEST series I've ever read... Love the characters and the story line kept me riveted from cover to cover. Be prepared for an emotional and intriguing ride!"
5	'Another great Katherine Pathak novel. Fun read and great storyline.'
5	"This book was great! I was thinking it was pretty lengthy but I appreciate it! It didn't leave out any details for the different characters and it wasn't overkill of information. This had me up until the early AM because I couldn't put it down!  The ending was icing on the cake!  I hate that the other female died.  I would have like her to hang around to suffer the loss of Drake after the crap she pulled to get him.  I absolutely loved each brother differently and how their characters evolved for the woman and women in their life.  This author is definitely going on my favorite author list."
5	'Very easy to read and comprehend, this book stays focused on wight loss and integration of cross-fit into your everyday workouts. In addition to being very nice to those of us just starting out, the reader is constantly reminded to keep up a healthy mental image and to never give up! Some people have said things such as "I\'m still fat" or "More of an essay"; however, fitness does not come from reading alone. The only way to get fit is to exercise, and exercise often. That being said, this book will help you get onto the right track towards your "dream body," so keep at it~\n\nI plan on buying my buddies a copy of this book for their birthdays, and I suggest you do too!'
3	'Not one of my favorite storylines.  normally I love these characters and the situations they get into but found myself thinking that a lot of it was not believable and wondering how much actual research went into the prison system and the way things are done.'
5	'What a romantic erotic tale with a handsome wolf alpha and a beautiful human woman. Virgin status makes her even more of a catch as well as physic abilities that she is just discovering. I feel that all readers who love great romantic shifter stories will enjoy this book'
5	"Raven and her friends are fun, interesting and well fleshed out. Pun intended (you'll get it when you read the books). Their dreadful adventure is fast-paced, thrilling and keeps you guessing. This is like no other apocalyptic work. Larsen knows what came before him, and he plays with well known themes while making his own unique story. His first book is a fun take on themes that needed a new, interesting voice. Well paced, interesting read that this reader really enjoyed. I give this book about apocalypse, friendship, love, and endurance despite the odds: 5 out of 5 Opinionated Zombies or stars."

5	"I was very glad that this book has some very varied recipes for substituting almond flour in common menu items.  While I do not have diet restrictions, I would like to incorporate alternative ingredients to broaden my experience and offer goodness that may have issues.  I will consider other books by this author.  However, the waffle recipe does not list almond milk or its quantity in the ingredients but list it's incorporation in the instructions.  I would add enough for a thick batter consistency.  It is obviously an isolated editing oversight."
3	"I enjoyed reading this book.  Although the book goes on about the girl's menstrual cycle, the way it was used, to me, was not so much disgusting as... well, I'm not sure how to describe it.\nThis girl's struggle to remain grounded in her ideals of faith and religion, and be submissive to what the historical period's idea of how she was to act made it a good read.\nIn today's society, the way this girl is treated would be an outrage. Its an outrage that women were treated this way in any age, but she comes through it like a champ.\nI recommend it."

4	"I loved this book as much as the first one my only problem, no Blake and I definitely felt his abscence.\nAfter losing Blake at the end of the last book after sacrificing himself for her Winter is lost it's been three months she calls him to her with his lodestone (a crystal that will let him know when Winter needs him) to no avail, until one day she sees a vision of him being held prisoner in the Dead Lands.\nWhile attending a graduation party Winter wanders off and is set upon by two Demori who realise that she is a Key but just as she is about to be attacked she is saved by Sam who has been on the run since the end of the last book.\nSam becomes her ally in trying to find Blake after realising from reading Blake's diary that he stole that he never killed anyone and that his family the Bane who are sworn enemies of the Demori had him believing that all Demori were bad.\nThrough Sam, Winter is introduced to more Bane members and they strike a deal with her, they'll reunite her with Blake after she opens a portal for them into the Dead Lands, so she flies out to France with Sam and her best friend Jasmine and after arriving at the castle has a feeling that something is wrong but she doesn't quite know what it is.\nAs in the last book this one has chapters relating to the past, this time to Ariman (Blake's father the first Demori) and Ariman's mother Lamara the Farseer, I find the back stories of all these characters really interesting and hope that the same theme continues in the next book.\nI also loved the addition of Blake's diary entries leading up to and after he met Winter to see what his thoughts were when they first met.\nI wasn't a big fan of Sam in the previous book but he's definitely one of my favourites now and I'm thinking that Sam has developed feelings for Winter and perhaps she might have done the same, I think that this would make an interesting twist to the story.\nAll in all this was a fantastic addition to this series, an unputdownable book from an author who knows how to keep you enthralled."
5	"Excellent commentary on one of my favorite books of the Bible, Ruth. The different information included by a selection of noted Bible scholars and ministers is well worth the affordable price. Spurgeon's  sermons alone are worth the price. A good investment for learning and understanding  God's word, book by book."
4	"It's a story of one man's life inside the Vietnam war... my ex-hubby had problems the rest of his life after Nam, he just passed a few months ago in a V.A. hospital. Enough said. Good reading!"
4	"I really liked this book. It was a fun adventure of a quirky, insecure and fun young women. Her adventures are cute, funny and just makes you root for her to finally get it right and find happiness. The author is great in setting a scene that really pulls you in. At times, the descriptive nature of the writing style almost seems a bit much until you realize that you are just so drawn into the story that it really doesn't matter too much. Overall, this was a light, fun read that will make you smile in the end. Also loved all the song references, and the quick wit of the supporting characters. Fun, Fun!"

1	'Do not recommend\nnot user friendly on old Kindle so not much fun to play doubt if I will ever use it'
2	'This is one more book that though have to buy 3 or 4 just to get to the ending. Thank goodness this was free.  spoiler alert...Maxwell is an $#hole!'
2	'This author was attempting a thorough analysis worthy of a grand jury summation. It just gets lost in the tangled and repetitive  arguments and bogs down. Worse, it is replete with grammatical and typographical errors so bad the reader finds himself wondering what the author is trying to say; this book reads like it was written by Paulie Walnuts!'
5	"I had some trepidation about this book, because I love Holmes books (both Doyle and any good pastiches) and I love stories about the Titanic, and I wondered how the author would do both justice.  I needn't have worried, however, because this book was tremendous.  I would have to put this in the top 2 or 3 of the pastiches I have read on Holmes, and I have probably read well over a hundred of them.  What I particularly liked about this book was that the author had Doyle down pat, but also improved on the originals by really bringing out the most noble elements of Holmes and Watson, along with writing a cracking good tale.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who has ever liked Holmes stories, and I definitely hope the author writes more of these."
3	"Interesting storyline.  Needs to be edited to correct spelling, typos and numerous other writing errors.  The author's ending of story as the beginning of a new one was ok.  It was a nice easy summer read."
1	'The book was ok. What bothered me is that this story was broken up into 5 "books" that each took less than an hour to read. Clearly a ploy to get more money out of people. Lame'
5	"Oh man if only shifters were real.  To be loved like that and forever....it's everything a girl could ask for!"
5	'I really enjoyed this book. Well written and straightforward. Great overview of the story of Plymouth Plantation. It was very engaging. Would recommend for anyone interested in history. A great read for high school students taking American history. Quick enjoyable read.'
5	'Jordon Holiday\'s "Practice Hands" is a haunting kaleidoscope of feeling, beauty, pain, elation, confusion, and hope.  The author\'s artful words paint the canvas of life with such eloquence that the reader cannot fail to be drawn into the struggle and beauty of the transformation depicted.  It has been 20 years since I have read any poetry so powerfully moving in its stark honesty and emotion. Words of such pristine beauty and depth could be improved only by being set to music. I hope that a musician searching for a magical, heartfelt lyricist will recognize the amazing talent of Jordon Holiday--his poetic words clearly deserve to be sung.'
4	'Lots of magic, not too much teenage angst, and an actual plot, though it did get muddled at the end. Actually a long book, not the usual short story for free. Would have given it 5 stars except it got way too ambitious at the end and added a lot of extra story line. When editing, it would be better to take out 20% of first half of book, then develop the part they added in at the last minute.'
1	'The book is a family favorite read and re-read on back packing trips, sailing trips, and by the fire.  This version is unreadable.  It is a computer printed edition with no spacing and a disagreeable manuscript type face.  I have returned it.'
5	'Everyone should read this to learn about all the ways our opinions and choices are driven by influencesway beyond our conscious knowledge.'
5	'The story holds my attention all the way through. I enjoyed reading it very much The writer has great word skills'
5	'I truly enjoyed reading every page of this scientific treatise on why Americans are so overweight and what they can do to change their situation.  Astonishing to read about the linkages to diabetes, heart disease, schizophrenia, acne and much, much more.  One must be very dedicated to give up all gluten. but certainly cutting back on these foods is doable.\n\nShould be mandatory reading for all high school seniors and college freshmen.'
5	'I really enjoyed this book although at some point I thought it was predictable so I was going to give it a 4 star rating. All of a sudden it gave a twist to the supposedly predictable end which made me change my mind. Good style, easy read and hard to put down.'
2	'Birds? Are there just this few birds in the world? The color is excellent, by the way. But the content is just too much less than expected.'

I\'m surely hoping for the 4th part to come soon. Ava is a mysterious creature, she\'s a half vampire, half... you\'ll learn later don\'t want to spoil and doesn\'t really know it. She begins with this adventure of learning what she is and what she can do, in the process meets some good and some evil that are within favor or destroy her. Ava starts working from one of this characters and is capture by other while help from some more. Is a really good trilogy, don\'t want to say more because I want to avoid Spoilers but if you like vampires with a twist this is for you. It is NOT only a vampire story it also brings fairies, angels, demons and so on, so on. So read this first one and decide for yourself.'
5	'Good item.'
5	'Vagrant Anne is a finely crafted story that makes you question your day to day relationships and interactions. In a world where we are conditioned to turn a blind eye to those in need, Vagrant Anne brings to light the need for compassion in a less than compassionate world. The end is disturbing  enough to make one self aware the next time they encounter a stranger.  Good read!'

He doesn't know much about her but he does know he wants to get to know her more. Lara feels attracted to Blake however her past is holding her back.\n\nWhat happens when the magic of Christmas gets involved??\n\nI really enjoyed this Christmas gem. Looking forward to reading more of this authors work."
5	'I really enjoy Dr Al Sears books. They are well researched, well written and give you the straight facts whatever the topic. This book is no exception. Would recommend to anyone interested in this topic!'
5	'I read all 4 books in this series to my sons 7 & 5.  They loved it.  As I would stop after one or two chapters they would ask me to read just 1 more chapter.  It is fun, well written.  I wish there were more books in the series.'
5	"Love the book! The writer definitely didn't spend a whole lot of time on the back stories...straight to the neaty griddy! Read it in one day! Could not put the book down! The sex scenes were absolutely INCREDIBLE! The connections between the two of them was great!"
1	'This book reads as if it was written by a 12 year old. The grammatical errors and poor editing make it almost unbearable to read. I am a firm believer of never leaving a book unfinished, so I went through with the whole thing, but it was bad. Bad, bad, bad.'
3	'The book was alright. Too short of a short story. I might read the next book. I wish the author would of written the book a little longer.'
4	'Complimentary copy provided by the author in exchange for an honest review.\n\nErin is a surgeon, finishing her residency and gearing up for her follow on fellowship. Becoming a successful surgeon is her ultimate goal, however she has done so by sacrificing her social life. She goes out with her intimate group of friends; Jack, her best friend since childhood, his roommate Simon, and Kara, her closest female friend, but has no sex life to speak of.\n\nWhen Erins sexual frustration becomes too much to bear, she agrees to participate in a threesome with Jack and Simon. It was beyond her wildest dreams and she is interested in doing it again. Surprising her though is Simons interest in BDSM. When she learns that he is an experienced Dom with a dungeon of his own, the two work out a mutually beneficial agreement. When Erin finds that its not only the sex that is helping her shake off some of the stress from her job, but also her role as a submissive, she soon finds herself in over her head, almost becoming addicted to the acts themselves.\n\nI loved the relationship that Erin has with both Simon and Jack. Erin is a very strong character, not taking any crap from either of the guys, and is willing to go for what it is she wants. The shared history between the friends lends to believability and the establishment of trust between them, something incredibly important in the D/s relationship between Erin and Simon.\n\nAs the relationship progresses between Erin, Jack, and Simon, cracks begin to appear, namely after Jack and Simon begin to explore their attraction towards each other. When emotions become involved as well, things go downhill in a hurry. There are unrequited feelings that threaten to break up the trio altogether. Can they remain friends after everything they have gone through? Or will the awkwardness be too much to overcome?\n\nWhile I liked most of the characters, for some reason I did not like Kara, at all. The way in which Erin spoke about her and to her did not lead me to believe they are friends at all, more like frenemies. I really disliked her as a character and saw very little value in her as a character; she was definitely more of an antagonist than friend to the group.\n\nThis book is hot, scorching hot. If the idea of MMF or MFM m&eacute;nage a trois doesnt appeal to you, youll want to skip this one. The BDSM scenes between Erin and Simon are descriptive (sometimes overly so) and depict Simon as an effective Dom, for the most part. The MFM scenes are hot, the MMF scenes even more so. Im definitely interested in how this relationship is going to play out.\n\nThis was a four star read for me. With the exception of Kara, I liked the characters and the storyline was well written; however, the descriptions of the sex scenes could become a little long winded at times (and I really had trouble visualizing them because it would seem that Erin is more Slinky than human). Like I said, I am definitely interested in seeing how this plays out because you just know that when you have a triangle such as this, things might be good at first, but at some point, someone is going to get left out.'
5	'Great !'
3	"Chasing Trouble is a meaningful and sexy romance by Joya Ryan. The characters are well-described, interesting and compelling. Unfortunately, with the exception of the first chapter, I found the plot to be a bit bland.\n\nJenna Justice, the primary female character, has a lot of good qualities. She is a wonderful kindergarten teacher and goes out of her way to help those children who need additional care. Since Jenna's mother is an alcoholic and considered trailer-park trash by the locals, Jenna goes out of her way to blend in and do everything right, so that she is acknowledged by the small town of Diamond, Kansas to be an upstanding citizen. Some of the town gossipers believe Jenna is just a chip off the old block and as a result, they never let her forget where she comes from. Luckily, Jenna has a group of very good friends who love and support her.\n\nProfessional bull rider Colt McCade, is the main male character in this story.  He is a good-looking guy that tends to shy away from any romantic commitments. He likes playing the field and in his line of work, it is very easy to do. Colt has known Jenna all of her life, because his younger sister is Jenna's best friend. After Colt lost his parents, he evolved into a wild child and was sort of forced out of Diamond at the age of eighteen. Now he is back in town, rehabbing, while staying with his sister and her young son.\n\nWith lots of history to cradle them, Jenna and Colt begin a romantic relationship.\n\nTo begin with, I could not understand why Jenna would want to live in Diamond. Some of the townspeople really don't like her and constantly harass her because they believe she is just like her mother. It is such an old fashioned attitude considering today's societal norms. Furthermore, Jenna comes across as a smart woman, so why would she let herself be bullied on a regular basis? Lastly, I was able to connect with Jenna and Colt individually, but not as a couple. Their sex scenes were well written, but I did not feel the heat between them. Overall, I found this to be a fair read.\n\nComplimentary copy provided by the publisher."

5	"Best one to date!!!! I have read all of Sarah Ashley's books and always amazed that they just seem to get better and better!!  All of her writings keep me glued and leave me wanting to read more. The artifacts took on a whole different intigue as we all kbow there are many haunted places but who knew there was so much to learn about haunted items. A best seller for sure!!!"
5	"This book provides a really really interesting take on the Second Coming .I've never read anything like it before so I can't  make comparisons. I think that's a good thing though since I originality is very big with me and sadly difficult to come by .Usually different means weird or off the wall .that's not the case here.while I will not pretend to have understood all of the points it wants to make I did enjoy the journey. I will definitely recommend it to people I know because I will want to hear their take on it. I will recommend it here to others as something you need to read and think about yourself."
3	"The quirky heroine in this story captured my attention right from the start.  A medieval heroine with a shoe fetish?  Yeah, something different!  The added mystery of a King's murder was good, too.  For the first half of the book, I was totally in to this story, then....I got SO sick of the shoe thing.  It was totally overdone.  While it is obvious that the author has done a lot of research into the time period (I was fascinated by some of the details), I kept pausing in my reading and wondering about the details of the 'proxy marriage.'  Although there may have been instances of a proxy being forced to consummate a marriage, I was unable to find any in any quick research that I did.  And, I find it difficult to believe that a proxy would remain in the household and serve as a substitute wife until the actual wife appeared.  Again, I don't really know if this happened but it was bothersome for me.  The ridiculous ending was a total let down and the killer...well, the last half of the book just didn't measure up to the first half for me.  I don't believe I will be reading any more by this author.  2 1/2 Stars rounded up to 3\n\nSexual situations may offend some readers"
5	"Couldn't wait to get the second book after reading the first."
4	"What a beautiful coming of age erotic drama. Even though it's a novella I warmed to the characters immediately.  Autumn and Jerry have been secretly attracted to each other for a number of years, and, in a dual POV story we discover that they are both using the college bonfire as the moment they will finally 'seal the deal'.  Sexy scenes, a bit of drama and romance and I'm happy to say an extremely enjoyable story.  Light, easy, definitely not the last KD Wood book I will read.  I received a copy of this book via GoodReads in exchange for an honest review."
3	'This story has potential, but the lack of editing makes this a tiresome read. Continuity issues need to be addressed, as well as transitions and character development. One-dimensional characters and stilted conversations abound.'
5	'Written in 1961 about a young woman in 1950s New Orleans, this book must have generated great controversy when it was first published. Joan, who is in college but just taking random classes and not working for a degree, has a sure, steady and boring beau named Fred that everyone assumes will result in marriage. Then she has a fling with Michael, and one thing leads to another and Joan is pregnant. Her all-efficient, Southern mother--the classic steel magnolia--arranges a safe abortion.\n\nBut no one talks about what happened, so much so that it\'s as if it never happened. Except for one thing: Joan can\'t deny it happened. The story focuses on her fragile psyche and the shocking thing she finally does to deal with it all, heal in body and mind and move on with her life.\n\nPulitzer Prize-winning author Shirley Ann Grau has written a story of the South, a story of the strength of Southern women and most of all a story of courage. It is heartbreaking, magnificent and inspired. "The House on Coliseum Street" will grab you at page one and not let go--and will haunt your thoughts long after you have finished.'
4	"The story was short and sweet.  It made me cry several times and had me rooting for Travis to open up Autumn's emotions.  It is a story that is relatable because many people shut off their emotions so they don't get hurt by someone else.  I can't wait for the next book to come out!!\nI received this book in exchange for an honest and unbiased review."
5	"Here are some core, practical ideas to sincerely and successfully interact with Koreans personally and professionally. With decades in and around the country, Korean post-graduate degrees and innumerable close connections with Korean business and societal leaders, Steven is in a class of his own.\nIf your goal is to respect and impress your Korean counterpart or competitor (and just as importantly not unknowingly embarrass yourself  or make the wrong first impression), Steven's concise explanations and examples are spot on.  Korea's been around millennia, and things have changed in many ways less than the 21st Century might think.\nYour relationship with your Korean counterpart is key to any subsequent success. Keep your professional edge sharp by knowing the critical cultural norms, the dividends of which are truly priceless."
5	'I can\'t say that I\'ve ever read any of Mr. Ali\'s written works before.  This, being my first introduction to him, is undoubtedly a wonderful "first impression."\n\nThe stories are just so interesting to me.  Having never traveled far from home, I am transported to a place...and a time... where life was simple.  Through these stories, I learned so much about the culture Mr. Ali grew up with as well as the imagination and resourcefulness that a young mind can conjure up.  Add a couple of cohorts, like Din and E and you\'ve got some interesting stories to be told!\n\nThroughout the book, I looked up some of the places, people, movies and even sports mentioned.  For example, I knew who Bruce Lee was, but did not know Ratno Timoer.  I found that I was learning as I was reading, laughing and enjoying myself.  It is a great book and whether you know Mr. Ali or not...you are going to really enjoy this book.  Highly recommend it!'
5	"Bad Habit was a superbly written and well-told story. We finally learned that Bad Habit's name was Braxton Earwood. It  was about time that Braxton would make a place in his heart for the mother of his four children. I like the fact that he had to beg Alex to marry him, he had to drag her caveman style.. The relationship always seemed to be on the fringe, just on the edge of a problem. BH always behaved like he was still single, especially when he was back at work after being home with Alex and the children for nearly a year. The children were their bond and for a while it looked hopeful. But over time, Braxton started to revert to his old behavior with women. He allowed women to think that he was available for them to claim. He did not mention to his former lady friends that he was married with quads. His behavior many times frustrated me, especially with the lady he flirted with at the gym and the lady that he interacted with inappropriate text. BH allowed these women to step over the acceptable line for a married man. I wanted Alex to hire someone to beat his a$$ quite a few times! In the end, a crisis with one of the children and an unexpected dalliance became his wake-up call. Finally BH loss his persona and Braxton the family man resurfaced a better man. This story had so many twists and matters that at time, I wanted to strangle some one. Blu Daniels did her job to make us want to fight for Alex and to see the story through to the very end.. It was worth every page.. Bravo Blu!!"

3	"Cardeno C is now one of my must read authors for gay romance so of course I snapped up the opportunity to read McFarland's farm.\nJared is pretty much a recluse living out a lonely life out in his farm in the middle of nowhere where the nearest civilization is a small town. So when he has the opportunity to lodge Lucas whom he's had a crush on for short while he sees it both as a blessing and torture.\n\nLucas is a spoilt rich boy from LA who is being punished by his father by being out to the farm to have some time to get his life together. Of course he doesn't want to be at the farm so he arrives with attitude.\n\nTheir meeting is a little awkward and it took a while for the initial tension to thaw out, what with Lucas' attitude and Jared laying down an ultimatum. But things finally move on and Lucas loses the attitude and earns his way by helping out with the office work.\n\nThis is a quick read and I read it while curled up on the sofa watching the evening news. But I have to say it's not the author's best work. I felt things were slow in places and we spent too much time in the characters' heads instead of seeing them interact via dialogue or action. Still, things did eventually heat up and the ending was sweet.\n\nIf you're looking for an easy read while you're waiting for an appointment or on a short train journey, then pick this up.\n\n3.5 Lovebites"

Oh my oh my... since book 1 I have been drooling over him. Not only is he cute, funny and BAD, but he is lovable and adorable. So being my favorite I have to scream his praises.  I wanted him with Chase because she was his ideal.. So now it is Hunter\'s staring role. There is a great treat in store for you all. A paternity issue, a love life, a dream and a family. All of which Hunter, my man is so deserving of.\n\nJust imagine a bunch of little Hunter babies who are yelling bacon all over the house. I would love it. Well I\'m too old but if I was younger Id take a chance on my cholesterol levels and ride the hog for Hunter.\n\nNow let me say this series is a wonderful addition if you enjoy glamour and rock style. I would say if you were a Sinner fan then this is another series you will totally fall in love with. There is a lot of steam, but nothing too racy. That is why I love this author, she wrote a romance for some unbelievable rock stars.'

4	"I picked up 'Saving the Hero' because it was free, it had an Asian man on the front cover, and it didn't appear to be erotic. It's a vampire book where vampires are bad because they're infected by a parasite that will drain their life away unless they consume human blood, as well as throwing them a tad bit off their mental balance. The main character is a homeless woman who hunts vampires to keep them from killing people, but she's no Blade, chasing after them with machine guns and super kicks. She's just an orphaned girl with a Billy Club and almost no training. I appreciated that she wasn't Supergirl without the heat vision, even though I also like heroines who can kick butt.\nFor the most part the characters' motivations made sense, and as the book progresses, more is revealed. I enjoyed their interactions and their quirks, and especially liked the excerpts from the uncle's journal. The writing could have used more polish, help with repetitive sounding sentences and the like, but although it was sometimes annoying, I never felt like putting the book down, which is really saying something since I quit three or four books before settling on this one and reading it through. I almost got irritated with the heroine's clunky thoughts about how attractive the man was, but it eased up quickly, and my guess is that it wouldn't bother other people, anyway. I felt the ending was a little weak, but it could have been a lot worse. Anyone who disagrees obviously hasn't read 'Allegiant'. There was plenty of humor in this book, some of it corny but most of it witty, kind of like a clean Stephanie Plum novel with vampires.\nLanguage: Maybe I'm forgetting something, but I don't remember any foul language. If it was there, it was mild.\nViolence: It's a vampire hunting book, so of course there's some violence, but nothing is gory or over the top. No kids rending each other limb from limb or anything like that.\nSexual Content: Surprisingly, none. The worst of it is a little kissing and cuddling.\nOver-All Message/Plot:  No message, and the plot held it together well. I think a lot more could have been done with some of the elements that led up to twists, maybe even making it creepy, but I'd say it was a good story geared toward a teen audience. Would I pay $4.99 for it? No, because I don't charge that much for my own books, but for those who aren't as cheap as I am and don't mind trading a McDonald's sandwich for a pleasant, easy read, this could be a good buy. Three and a half stars, rounded up to four.\nTo find out why having an Asian man on the cover piqued my interest, check out my blog rawhitebooksandmore.weebly.com."
5	"I didn't expect this book to go the way it did. This was a really good book. It's different then the usual guy cheating on girl book, it the opposite with a twist. This really shows you that you can't go around treating people like crap and think nothing will come out of it. However I don't think Cordero really deserved and happy ever after or her co worker or mama for that matter. I think Tanji got it a little too hard, she's young and that's what a lot of young people do; cheat. They weren't married, just shacking up so her punishment shouldn't have been that bad, although she did deserve some. I really enjoyed this book regardless, and will be looking out for other titles by the author."

5	"Oliver, the Earl of Carlisle, sees a very pretty young lady being ignored at a dance, and goes over to rescue her.  He discovers she isn't a shrinking wallflower but a spirited American who is in England visiting her grandparents.  They immediately hit it off.  But they can't marry because Oliver has just discovered his father died broke.  Oliver has to marry an heiress, and quickly, before he, his tenants, and his staff are all out on the street.  Grace, meanwhile, has no interest in a love match.  She needs to marry in order to get the dowry her grandparents promised her, and then go back to America with the money to help her extremely ill mother get well.  These are two caring characters who seem to be in impossible situations.  This is a well-written, interesting, fun book, with good dialogue and good characters."

3	"I'm not sure if the author read Twilight right before she wrote this book but there are so many similarities:\n\n*SPOILER ALERT*\n\n- girl from a sunny climate who moves to the northwest\n- girl is always falling or tripping\n- one person can read minds\n- love interest is immortal and doesn't explain why he seems to detest her\n- a male friend who has a crush on the girl\n- a gang of older guys almost attack the girl until the love interest steps in\n- one almost car crash until the love interest steps in\n- a character named allistair\n- love interest leaves for the girl's sake but comes back\n\nI gave this 3 stars because I read the whole book, which I can't say for a lot of YA books out there. Plus, I want to know what happens to her in book 2."
5	'Great read! I love this series!'
5	'Deadly Image by Tamelia Tumlin was a most enjoyable book that kept me sitting on the edge of my seat wondering what was going to happen next. Lexi Yates lost her husband, a much loved minister in Dallas, a year ago and because of all the memories she moved with her three year old daughter, Anna, to Gator Bayou, Louisiana. Anna has disappeared without a trace and everyone in the town seems to think that Lexi is responsible. FBI agent Ace Valdez has been sent from his New Orleans office to take charge of the investigation. Due to evidence that points to Lexi as the guilty party, the local sheriff is ready to arrest Lexi for kidnapping and because of this her faith in God is sorely tested. Ace has seen all the evidence yet he has a gut feeling that Lexi is innocent. Because of things in his past, Ace does not trust easily and he does not want to have any feelings for Lexi but there is something about her that causes him to believe she is innocent.\n\nThe author did a very good job of developing the plot, characters, dialogue, and action scenes. In most mysteries I can usually figure out who did the crime but the author had me guessing to the very end, in fact I was completely surprised when the identity of the kidnapper was revealed. There were many twists and turns in the story providing one surprise after another. I could not put the book down once I started reading for I just had to know what happened next. I do not want to say more for I do not want to give away the ending of the story.\n\nI would recommend this book to anyone who loves a good mystery with a lot of romance thrown into the mixture and who also wants to read Christian fiction.\n\nMy thanks to the author, Tamelia Tumlin, for providing this book free in exchange for an honest review. The opinions I have expressed are my own.'
5	"A must for any seller or buyer - to learn and/or refresh ones' knowledge with regard to the most common payment methods in the international trading business world! This short book - only 61 pages - is written in a very professional way, yet at the same time, in a simplified language that anyone can understand. The clear explanations, along with the examples and summation at the end of each explained payment type, helps the reader to further understand the pros and cons of each payment type.  Thus, helping the businessman make the right business decision, with the highest protection, at the lowest risk. I look forward to reading the next book in the series of International Trading, to be written by Ran Pelly."
5	"I really enjoyed reading this book. The story of Angie & Caleb was written extremely well and the characters were well thought out.  Caleb's reluctance to team up with Angie for a class project got me interested and kept me reading this book.  Her past and his past are both unforgettable until they learn to be forgiven and do it together.  This was a story of young love and a willingness not to give up on each other.  I would highly recommend this book."
1	"If you're into porn, look no further, you have found that which you have sought. If, on the other hand, you were in search of romance, your search will have to continue. I gave up, half way through the first book. Sex scenes were given waaaay and above too much attention. This is not what I was looking for. At all."
5	"This was a good read. Kept me engaged from start to finish. Can't wait to read the next book and other books written by her."

So she hooks up with Lance yet after seeing him being beaten and steps in to help him out, she has placed herself right into the sight of the his troubles radar.\n\nThe book had some intense emotions, great characters and the ending was perfect.'
4	'Charyn has written a novel rather than a biography and as a novel it reads very well.'
5	"A story of a group of children traveling the stars under the umbrage of a creepy empire. It has a class of narration that you don't get in many books. You can tell it takes its spacefaring from other sources, but it takes its own turns, both into the charming and the horrific.\n\nI also suggest Mimaska."
5	"Soooo, I'm sharing right away\nThat I switched to my Fire\nTo read this second book\nof The Adventures of Bob...\nAnd I'm very glad to say,\nthat if your child is using a reader these days\nThen the color and message\nis quite fine for reading\nI still like the book to hold\nBut do feel free to choose,\n'Cause both are highly recommended\nAnd I simply have to say\nI'd share with all kids... any day!\n\nBob is now working for Mary Marine and his first job is to baby sit...well, actually, much more than that. You see Kody's mother had become very tired and needed to rest, but still need to have her baby trained to eat. The only thing is that Kody was afraid of the deep water where the seals routinely fed. A very important need to be met...\n\nBut Bob had never gone into the deep water either--now he was being called upon to teach somebody else to do so... What to do?\n\nA major point for me is that the book has been written to let Bob know that it is alright to be afraid and to be fearful you can't do what has been asked of you. What do you think Doc did to help Bob meet this new challenge? [check out my blog for pics and excerpts]\n\nWell, he got through that ordeal, but what if you mess up? (And he sure did?) And he got someone in trouble! You see he was supposed to help clean up debris and he was given a net to throw into the sea... But when he and Zena threw the net...they didn't see who sat below! And now he was entangled and couldn't free himself!. Instead of immediately helping poor Beck, Bob started arguing and blaming Zena and she did just the same! But finally they stopped and started running for help and came upon Earl who instead of suggesting how to help, immediately gave some sage advice:\n\nBut still there was a problem to solve! Do you have any suggestions? Then he saw Cathy and ran to her, asking for help... What do you think? Cathy's just a girl, a crab girl at that, right? How can she help???\n\nThe next emergency was that Belle had got caught under the sea and couldn't free herself! Bob's work never stopped and this time he'd need help in the rescue! Who would you ask to help you go into the ocean to find a scared stingray?!\n\nBut then a really big emergency that affected everybody came! A large storm was coming and everybody needed to be told! Can Bob handle this final assignment for the day?! Bob went out to help...but could he get back to shore?!\n\nBob was getting depressed, considering all that he had gotten into. There had been many who had depended totally on him! Had he made a wrong choice? Should he rethink his plans...He had much to consider after today...\n\nOk, I've fallen in love with these wise sea creatures! And the humans are flawed just like us... So all of us has much we can learn in this second book! It's not always an adventure when someone is or could be in danger...You have to be special to be Blue Ocean Bob...\n\nEnjoy this one! It is the most animated of the three while the other two are more about learning. Bob always goes into a task, thinking he's prepared. Sometimes he is; sometimes he isn't...But it never is wrong to ask for help...\n\nHighly recommended\n\nGABixlerReviews"

5	"Remember a few years ago a very talented young musician uttered the words heard round the world proclaiming he has never, couldn't ever be sexually attracted to a black woman? Though preferences are allowed, the wording and venom that they conveyed lost him this sistah's love, respect and hard earned money; never bought another album.\nBut what if he had tried to atone for his racist rant? What if his damage control involved being seen with a beautiful dark skinned lovely  on his arm? What if in the midst of this charade  his heart tripped over his stupid tongue and he fell in love with the very type of woman he had so callously dismissed?\nAnd what if she had ulterior motives?\nAll of my WHAT IF'S are the premise of this wonderfully fresh love story. I loved all the characters. They were realistic although Shaun's modeling gigs were a bit of a stretch, then again maybe it really is WHO you know and not WHAT you know. Adam totally stole my heart and even had me getting all moony-eyed for an actual rock star with that moniker.\nToo bad the real life offender didn't have this tale of redemption at his disposal when he took his racial mistep. If he'd proved more like Adam, I'd no doubt have his last three albums on my shelf.\nThis is a great book and I'm sure you'll think so too!"

Everyones Devon may be different but they all leave you raw and bloodied. I still am and this book touched me on a personal level. I am more the read for Clover's story but I hope we will continue to hear from Willow, I have a feeling there is more to tell!\nThere is not one book of hers left for me to read they all A-maz-ing! She is a truly talented writer, the characters are complex and thought out, the sex is fantastic (beyond fantastic). This book is for the fan who enjoys the truth, ugly truth and beautiful truths of life. I say this all the time to the people I love, Own it!

4	'4.5 stars This is a wonderful contemporary romance set in New Zealand. Georgia was hired by "The Three Kings" nonprofit organization which is run by three brothers. One is a doctor, another is a scientist and lastly is Matt. She writes and illustrates a set of books so kids don\'t get scared of machines and medications that keep them alive. Matt loves what he does. Georgia was hired over a year ago by Matt and his brother. Matt really likes her and she likes him. The are both relationship shy. I loved this series as it dealt with childhood illnesses and the toll they take on the kids and their parents. I always think romances are better rounded when one of the main characters has a child to raise. It\'s more realistic in today\'s society. I received a free copy of this book solely in exchange for an honest opinion.'

5	"This is a great guide for anyone wishing to write an autobiography. Larsen has managed to squeeze an in-depth guide into a 25 page booklet. The booklet helped me crystallize  my thoughts into a coherent form. He uses some of his own life experiences as examples and it makes for some interesting reading. All in all it provides an excellent framework for anyone wishing to record their life story. And all for 99 cents ! Can't beat that."
5	'This was another great read, either a stand alone or it ties right in with the other books. This is a great one about the choices you had to make in every day life, good vs bad'

5	'From the first chapter you are pulled into an intriguing journey.  This journey takes you down into the mysterious depths of the earth.  Every chapter ends with the reader wanting more as the characters develop and move through the story.  The end of the book leaves you hanging and desiring more.  What WILL the future bring for these characters?'

2	"This story is set up in the previous book. I read that and feel I would have been slightly lost if I hadn't done that because the notion of 'mates' doesn't feature in the interaction between Tim and Nathaniel at all in the first 20% of the book I read, which on the one hand helps the reader appreciate things from Tim's point of view, but not the significance of events from Nathan's perspective as they unfold. I didn't get further than 20% of the book when I felt I needed to skip ahead and even when I started reading again at 70% things weren't better - the story was really slow going, almost rambling with ever-present angst. I liked the MC's and the town, even though everyone in that town seems hell-bent on finding entertainment in lovers struggling to find their way and simply staying out of the way, but the way the drama was drawn out made me lose my patience.\n\nI really loved the first book in the series, liked the second book, the third was okay - this the fourth in the series is the weakest in my opinion. No more books in this series for me. $8.99 was too much to pay for a book I barely got through."
5	"I received a copy of this book free in exchange for an honest review.\n\nThis short read was wonderful. It grabbed me and held my attention right from the first page. There were so many delightful surprises woven into it. Im hesitant to say much because I don't want to spoil it for readers.\n\nI really appreciated how the elements regarding gender and orientation fluidity were simply a matter of fact in the storys context. They required no explanation, which would have been out of place in the fantasy setting. It was refreshing and much appreciated.\n\nThere were so many facets, from mystery and horror to sensual and romantic. Not to mention strong, talented women saving their worldwhat could be better?\n\nThis is my favorite kind of fantasy, where its easy to become utterly lost and absorbed in the world the author has created. Even in such a short tale with little detailed world-building, I had a good sense of the characters and setting.\n\nBeautifully written, and I will be looking for more of Ms. Derrs work to read."

2	"A sorry attempt to mimic the style and humor of the original Douglas Adams series.  Completely misses the mark.  I only got about 50 pages in and completely lost interest.  On the whole, it wasn't worth the 50 pages I suffered through."

2	'I wanted to give this a 2 and a half star rating, but wasn\'t able to do that.\n\nRhone was a decent, enjoyable read that could have been even better with a good editor. The constant use of description of clothing drove me batty at times, and the first third of the book, when the gods were involved, suffered from flowery language that reminded me of a cheap romance novel. Sometimes there were missing words (you could figure out what they were supposed to be easily enough), and in some places the grammar suffered.\n\nAnd perhaps Karr doesn\'t want us being too critical of his work, based on a statement by Rhone himself on page 226: "I prefer not to critique the works of others. The writer created something from nothing, and deserves credit for such." This made me chuckle.\n\nBut despite the inherent problems here, I did find myself entertained, pushing on to the finish. Some parts dragged out, while other parts seemed not to be fully enough explored. A good book lies somewhere underneath all of this. As I said, a good editor could have helped shape this into so much more than what we get here. Yet if he produces another Rhone book, I would buy it, because after going through all the trials and hardships with the big guy, I know that I\'ll sort of miss him now that our reading relationship is finished.\n\nFor those of you who want to know just what this book is about, Rhone is a former soldier who has mixed blood, a quarter of which is demon. A demigod, who wants to usurp his father, the god king, knows of a weapon that could do such. But he needs someone to do certain tasks for him, because if Ducain, the demigod, does them himself, his father will be able to detect it. He tricks Rhone into believing that his daughter has been murdered, but that Rhone can yet free her soul. It is on this premise that Rhone is willing to travel to the land of the dead and free a titan there who once tried himself to kill the god king. This titan, once Rhone frees him, should be able to recover the powerful weapon.\n\nAlong the way we see Rhone as a soldier, fisherman, and father. There is a lot of action and bloodshed, and some interesting background on some of the characters.\n\nKarr, you do have some talent, but it can be honed into so much more. Stephen King has some things to say about cutting out adverbs (and possibly some adjectives, but I no longer remember) in his instructional book "On Writing." You may want to check this out, because I believe it could help make you a better writer.'

5	"Okay so this is my second book I have read by this author and I loved it. The characters were well developed and interesting to read about. I loved reading about Kailani's character because she reminded me so much of myself. I liked Bishop in the beginning because he was so arrogant and bold and enticing. As the story progressed, my opinion of him changed, he was really a compulsive liar. I didn't understand how preached about loyalty and honesty when he always lying. I felt bad for my boo Rell because he really loved and did everything for Layyah. I wished Rell and Kailani would have crossed paths first because I feel they are more suited for each other. Last but not least Courtney, at first, I respected him for letting go of Lani while he do his time because 10 years is a long time for someone to wait on him but I don't know why he expected everything to go back to the way it was before he went to jail. He worked my nerves because he got bitter that Lani didn't want to be with him so he did petty bull crap. He was acting like a female smh. Overall great book. On to part two!!!!!"

I was a bit disappointed to find that the text had many lines trough it.  Not sure if this was the final draft or what but it made it difficult to read.  I contacted kindle support and they advised me to delete from my kindle fire and try the download again.  Well when I did I had the same results.  Purchased several books for my kindle fire and never had this problem before.  Good thing it didn't cost much."

Not realizing that this really can happen to people.  I felt as if I knew the characters and felt bad for the things they were going through.  However the one thing I would have liked to have added was a future ending.  Meaning how the two young females characters in the book grew up and how the old friends grew up.  Other than that, it was a great story!"

Twists and turns that you would not, could not expect or imagine.  The lustful moments made my heart race and my grip tighten, leaving me with an urge for more!  Ashley is a beautiful writer, with such vivid and crazy imagination.  I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the series.  Grab a glass of wine, this book - and treat yourself to a girls night in ;-)"

4	"This latest book of Tom Wright is a wonderful read for it reflects his latest thinking.  Wright is preparing to write his fourth volume in his six volume opus on the Gospels.  So he devotes especially the last chapters to John, a book he says he dearly loves like his wife, but does not completely understand.  Wright's theme in the book is that Eternal Life occurs immediately when a person believes in Jesus Christ and trusts him, when he choses to pray to the Father in the name of the Son and in the power of the Holy Spirit.  Too many Christians fail to realize that after baptism one begins a life of sanctification, of growing up in the Christian faith by the leading of the Holy Spirit.  Wright, as a former pastor and bishop, wants people to understand that fellowship with the Triune God begins immediately after baptism is the purpose of God for their lives.\n\nHowever, Wright angers evangelicals by saying that the Roman Road with its emphasis on: If you died tonight, would you go to Heaven? is all that Christianity is about.  I believe he is correct but he goes back to depreciating this approach so much that it soon becomes an irritant to one who does not agree with him.  This uncharitable approach is the reason for 4 stars rather than 5.l\n\nWright, as usual, phrases his arguments well and supports them with Scripture.  Although he intimates several times that he wants to emphasize\nthe Gospels in this book, he cannot help but go back to his mentor Paul devoting several chapters exclusively to him and giving what seems to be a short presentation of the scheme of the entire book of Romans.  I am looking forward to his next volume in the opus.  This is one of his preliminary books which has many important insights into the Gospel of John.  It follows on Surprised by Hope, Surprised by Scripture and several others.\n\nIn sum, it is a great read with many wonderful insights.  He is emphasizing that the Christian should look forward to living together with God and the Lamb in the New Jerusalem in the New Heaven and New Earth and to reigning with them.  This will be a continuation of the close personal relationship a Christian has with the presence of Jesus in their lives right now -- inaugurated eschatology.  He is my favorite theologian, knowledgeable about the Bible.  Well worth reading again and again, highlighting and underlining."
5	'Absolutely love this book!!'
5	"I highly recommend this book! He is an excellent writer and is so honest about his story and gives hope and ways to overcome OCD. It's powerful!  It is a meaningful book for people with OCD and also for others because you will get insight into what it is like to struggle with this mental illness that affects so many people."
5	'I read it in one sitting and have bought copies for friends.  This sounds simple, but it is powerful stuff.  Lots of interesting research findings mentioned to give you confidence to try some of the suggestions here.  I love this book.'
3	"Just finished this book.  It's an interesting account of one man's journey from honest fisherman to murder, thug, kidnapper, and immigrant to America.  The book is not well written but it's filled with the authors' rationalization about how piracy and murder are everyone's fault but the perpetrators.  While it may be true that multinationals have over fished and dumped poisons in Somalia.  no objective evidence is offered though.  What is true is that the author Noor is living in comfort in Minnesota off the spoils of kidnapping and murdering French soldiers.  How this criminal was allowed to enter the USA boggles the mind.  Let's hope the French government read the book and seek extradition of Noor for murder, kidnapping, and piracy."

5	'Kade has been fascinated by all things Titanic since he heard the story of how his grandfather was lucky enough to avoid being on the ship. So when a Titanic Exhibition comes to the museum in NY, he wants to see it, even if it means joining the dorky school history club to get in. Simon is also into the Titanic and a keen member of the history club. The two boys end up slipping back through time together and find themselves on the ship itself, returning to past lives. They desperately try to think of a way to stop the disaster and as the days and hours tick past, the tension mounts. This is a tense and exciting time travel tale about two teenagers, the tough kid and the geeky kid, who would not normally be friends, but pull together and find friendship and learn more about themselves and what is important in life, all the while living a memorable event in history. The descriptions of the ship were wonderful, and I was right back there with them on board. A great adventure for all readers, young and old.'

1	"I think a better title for this book would be opening up range of motion for the elderly who aren't moving much. There isn't much yoga here. Mostly stretches and range of motion exercises."
4	'Like most of this kind of romance books. It starts quickly and builds just as fast.\nHopefully the story can with stand the pressure of the intense sexual situations.\nI like Devon she is wounded but is a survivor.\nNow Zack is truly intense.\nI want to see where this goes.\n\nJojoreads'

5	"Steampunk, Victorian, with a little mix in of Goth, Hand of Miriam is a mixture of novel I am personally not familiar with, but very much enjoyed reading.  And it even added some supernatural with werewolves, vampires, wraiths, with the main points of interest being angels and demons.\n\n  Bayla Gideon is on an archaeological expedition when her husband dies and she is the only survivor to the freak storm that happens.  During this time Bayla is branded with the Hand of Miriam, an all seeing eye that can sense evil and allows her to know the thoughts of others when left uncovered.  Desperate to keep herself alive while creatures ranging from rogue werewolves to demons try to attack her, she awakens the Golem in the archives at her home and frees him from his curse.\n  In Jewish legend a golem is a clay figure brought to life by magic.\nThe Golem is named Gesher.  He was a fallen angel that was made into a Golem to serve whoever awakened him.  Because Bayla allows Gesher to destroy the very thing that awakened him, he is now able to change from the scary and imposing clay man into a more normal looking man, although he still has the hardened body of a warrior and has scars where his wings used to be.  Because he fought the angel of death to keep a child from dying in a family that had already lost so much, he was stripped of his wings and sent to Earth as the Golem.  However,  there was the possibility of his returning to Heaven one day should he redeem himself.  That was all good until he went and fell in love with the beautiful, independent, and head strong Bayla Gideon.  Now he must make the decision to either stay on Earth with her or return to Heaven.  Before it had been an easy choice.  Now he found himself thinking he didn't want to live without her.\n  The Hand of Miriam had not only given her the power to discern evil where it was present, but also the gift of immortality, if she could keep herself alive.  She was not immune to illness or accident.  That is why she needs Gesher, but her feelings for the tall and crazy handsome fallen angel are causing her to want him to stay permanently on Earth.  But she refuses to be the one that keeps an angel on Earth.  Meanwhile, a serial killer is on the loose killing prostitutes within the city and someone is killing female vampires as well.  The killer has been named Jack the Ripper and Bayla starts suspecting that perhaps even one of the Grigori, a secret society which even involves Queen Victoria and all things supernatural, might be the culprit.  She has no idea just how deep it will go and just how in danger she is.  Gesher has his work cut out for him keeping Bayla safe from those that would do her harm.\n\n  As I said before, this novel is a very different read from my norm.  But if you like all things paranormal/supernatural, angels and demons type thing, then you should try this book out.  With a hint of spooky and a hot fallen angel, it is sure to keep your attention.  I do find it a very strange element to the story that Bayla has to keep her hand uncovered for the marking to work.  And the fact that it can be fooled as well, it is just very difficult to do so.  But the dirigibles, strange machines, and unconventionality of the story really work for it!"
4	'Good for a short. I was waiting for more, but still ok. Looking forward to the next release in September.'
5	'loved it.'
4	'I never knew how really terrible being in the military could be for gays and lesbians.  This story is the very direct account of a fictional character who joined the marines at a young age.  It brings to light the everyday actions of discrimination that she went through and the constant fear of attack by the male members of the marines.  Brave storytelling.'
4	'This is a very readable take on a Western set not in the good old 19th Century, but in the beginning of the 20th Century.\n\nJake Turner is a disaffected former soldier who fought in the Spanish American War. He can\'t put down roots, although he\'d love to settle and farm a nice piece of land. Somehow or other, he can\'t get traction even though he knows farming inside and out.\n\nBut he\'s a tough man who the Sheriff of a small town in North Dakota believes is just the Deputy needed to keep the peace.\n\nJake has settled for a while because of his friendship with a very sick man named Isaac. In caring for the man, Jake begins a correspondence with Isaac\'s sister, Alice. While more or less pretending to just be helping Isaac write the letters, Jake includes more direct notes to the woman. Over time, he\'s developing feelings for the young school teacher he\'s never met.\n\nThe book begins with the investigation into the murder of Thor (not the god), a mean SOB according to all including the man\'s widow.\n\nAs Jake learns more, he begins to feel there\'s a whole lot more to the killing than first meets the eye. He believes the widow to be the murderer, but discovers small clues which point to his friend, Isaac.\n\nWhile Jake unravels the mystery, Alice comes to North Dakota and Jake falls for her...hard. He\'s also taken an orphan boy under his protection. Along with his horse, his dog, and cat, Jake is accumulating a family that he doesn\'t feel he deserves. He also knows his discoveries in regard to the murder put everyone around him in grave danger.\n\nOkay, anything more will be spoilers, so I\'ll just say that Jake grows on you, despite his strong, silent personality.\n\nMy only complaint is that the text drags a bit about 2/3rds into the book. I think a bit more trimming is in order. I think the 92K book could easily be cut to 85K. The plot surrounding the murder is also fairly complex. Since I read before going to sleep, I found my attention wasn\'t as close as it needed to be. I ended up backtracking because I kept feeling like I missed something when I should have turned off the Kindle and gone to sleep. So, fair warning, keep your eyes wide open when you\'re reading or you might miss some important clues.\n\nOverall, a very good read.\n\nOkay, just one more little gripe. The author attributes the book, "The Call of the Wild" to Joseph Conrad, rather than Jack London. I think somebody decided to change the book reference, but forgot to change the author. Mentioning this is totally petty on my part, but I thought the error too much to ignore. Okay, so I studied Modern American Lit in college, so I\'m a little picky. There were a couple of other minor historical inaccuracies, but none of that will get in the way of enjoying the book.'
4	'Two high school seniors take a first holiday without their parents and choose to stay in a picturesque Welsh village. The guesthouse where they lodge and life in the village are carefully drawn and the inevitable spanking seems entirely credible. I enjoyed this as much as Geraldine Roberts earlier book and although not such a complicated plot, it is that much more believable.'

5	'great leadership pointers'
4	'I did not enjoy this book because the story line centered on the main characters work and detective activities rather than the romance.'
5	'Great story, once you start reading you cannot stop, it is like a telepathic mind meld (oops Mr Spock, apologies). Being time transported, unknowingly one thousand years into the past, brings us to an anime to world, that we must live through, to understand the future.'

5	"I loved this book, BUT.....it can be confusing at times as it jumps around in three different time periods because of the three main female characters in this book. I know it's just a writing style, but I dislike movies that do this too. Yes, the plot thickens as each three layers are exposed to the readers which creates even more mystery. The stories of these three women twist and turn as they have lost a lover(s), found compelling new love, and the huge mystery of a forgotten attic room in the Pratt Mansion. All three women have lived in the mansion during different generations. #1) Olive is a housemaid at the mansion who seeks revenge against the owner regarding her father. #2) Lucy is Olive's daughter who is seeking the truth about her father and is a secretary in New York. #3) Kate is Lucy's daughter and was a nurse in WWII. She seeks equality in the male dominated medical field, and she falls in love with one of her patients. He came into her hospital with a slim chance of living. When Kate pulls back the blanket she is mesmerized with his handsome appearance. She immediately feels passion for him, and she feels it's forbidden since he's a patient of her's. A well-written book with many plots revolving around these three women and three different time periods in history. It's ironic that there's three authors of this book too. You certainly wouldn't know it though as everything seems to just glide smoothly."
5	"This is an excellent, well written and easy to understand book., Everything is laid out clearly and easy to understand. It even comes with a programmed workout in an excel document spreadsheet which is extremely easy to use. The program is based on the concepts in the book and is laid out clearly. You really can't go wrong this book."
5	'This book is a must-read. The author patiently and clearly lays out the setting at the beginning of the story, and then pulls you into a world of adventure with Jobie and friends, that leaves you wanting to read more. Two thumbs up!'
4	"Still reading the book, but I feel it's a lot of great information provided thus far.  I'll continue to read and provide more later."
2	"Not really for me. I need an obstacle for my couple to overcome that's keeping them apart. The two characters already start out with feelings for each other and then act on them the first chance they get."
5	'Right now, this is the funniest book on the market, an absolute SCREAM! DO check it out before the election makes it dated, or Trump self-implodes, whichever comes first.'
5	"I really enjoyed the book coming from the authors voice, I didn't feel like I was being lectured, I just felt like I could have it all...I would recommend this book to anyone struggling with addiction or just being unhappy about how their life is going"
4	'I enjoyed the Snow series. I just loved Rev Snow and how much faith he had in the Lord. Seed of Discord was the best of the series. i thought it would end a different way. Ms. Kinney new how I was thinking and blew the ending out of the park. Congratulations looking forward to your next story.'

5	"Rejoice, now married to the boy she didn't like but came to love, faces new challenges. Not only the native life, but a group of humans whose way of life is a startling contrast to that of the first settlers, and who seem determined to persuade Rejoice's group to their way of thinking, by fair means or foul. Can the first colonists, pacifists dedicated to helping others, manage to save themselves without resorting to actions that would destroy their belief system? And what's going on with Rejoice's husband, now a pastor, who seems to minister to everyone but his own family? Another suspenseful, well-told episode in the saga of Rejoice and her people."

5	"The Hurricane Lover by Joni Rodger is an awesome and outstanding read that starts up on the first page and does not let up until the very last page! The main story is about Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and the devastation of life and home and hope it left behind in its horrendous wake. The story caught me in its grip early on and I found myself holding my breath when one of the characters, Shay a young woman, has to get herself to safety after the flood has started and she sees dead rats, snakes, people floating by her and dragging her under the filthy water rushing down the streets. Between Shea who is a journalist, and her on and off again boyfriend of several years, Dr. Corbin Thibodeaux, a Gulf Coast climatologist and storm risk specialist, who has been telling all the people who are supposed to do something that everyone needs to get out, it is a frustrating situation to say the least, for him.\n\nOn top of this Shea has stumbles on the story of a con artist who uses storm-related chaos as cover for identity theft and murder, and the next victim is Corbin's brother, so Shea thinks, but it actually is their friend that has just used the brother's photo! This causes a huge fight between Corbin and his brother who does not even know what Corbin is getting upset about! So while Shay has gotten Corbin into the mess the whole city of New Orleans is flooding all around them.\n\nWhat is also one of the problems is that Corbin Thibodeaux is a 5th generation member of the family, taking care of his brother from the time he is 13 as their mom and dad are both gone. Now his brother's wife is going to have a baby at any time during this storm and that would have made the 6th generation of family born in their home, but they do evacuate to Shea's parent's home in Houston, while Shea and Corbin keep fighting with her Dad who loves her more than anything and even though he is a powerful oilman from Texas, his soft spot is his daughter and he wants to kill Corbin and has for several years. So we have two warring families.\n\nThe author used actual news bulletins in the book that were authentic and it made it even more scary and when the levee did break the characters see it in full detail, and Shea almost gets killed in the water.\n\nAt the end of the book there is a huge showdown and two people almost lose their lives, and then Corbin and Shea have some unexpected news themselves, which is another twist to the plot!\n\nAll I can say if you like fiction that is more real than fiction, love stories and a murder or two thrown in you will love this book!\n\nI gave this book 5 stars and will be reading more by this author! Received a copy for an honest review."
4	"This book was the stuff. This was better than the other three. Kadisha was a beast, but I really think she was wrong for Mellow. How could she expect to keep faithfulness if she didn't give what the relationship needs. It has to be Shamika or Big Bee who is the snitch. I really think it is Big Bee only because Shamika really like Rah-Rah. Please let Mellow no okay. I like him. I hate continuations. Definitely recommended."

5	'As a casual golfer that plays maybe ten times a year, I\'ve changed from shooting in the 110\'s to consistently shooting in the high 90\'s after reading this. The success I\'ve had is due solely to this book. I can\'t remember having so many "ah-ha" moments as the pieces of my short game finally fell into place. I\'ve gained the confidence around the greens where before I just had to wing it and hope I made the right decision. This book doesn\'t overwhelm you, but gives you the necessary tools to take your game to the next level. I highly recommend this book and good luck to my fellow readers!'
5	'The author mentioned a statement that jolted me out of my chair..." end your wanderings and instead,focus on the answer that is already within you." It reminded me of the incantation that Tony Robbins taught in his  "date with destiny" seminar. The incantation that we shouted out as we walked along the golf course at night in Gold Coast, Australia many years ago was..." all that I need is within me now."\nSteve has done a wonderful job to remind us that that all the answers to master our mind are already in our mind and he offers simple yet effective tips on how to draw out the tools and techniques to reach our higher potential.\nAnother must have self improvement book to add to your library.'

2	"There is barely a story just one skip after another. Everyone just stays the same except Grandma Bella and the eye. I've been a bug fan but it seems like the last few books weren't worth buying. Sorry Janet but they've lost the flair."
2	'Not enough useful information'
5	'This is an outstanding collection of short stories that cover almost every type of real life situation from childhood to adulthood. I was laughing out loud one moment and wiping away a tear in the next.  The author is able to convey an idea, thought, emotion and lesson in short conside stories that bring back childhood memories of my own.  There are also a reminder to live life to the fullest.\n\n[...]'

4	"I enjoyed reading Oh, Professor! Box Set, all about Callie a freshman whose on scholarship at the University & her History Professor Scott. It seems the half-way mark is upon them and grades are sent out letting the students know where they stand. Unfortunately for Callie she's running a low D in history, and this one grade could take away her scholarship, she has to get extra-credit to bring her grade up! The author wrote a very interesting story, and the characters certainly made the story work. If you are looking for something that is fast paced, and will get your blood pumping this is the book set for you. Just prepare yourself to become very very wet! Hope you enjoy reading it as much as I did!"
5	"This was a really great read, combining two interests of mine in an unlikely but excellent way: Dante's Inferno and lesbian romance.  At times tense, touching, and erotic, I tore through it in no time at all.  A definite recommendation."
5	"All 3 books in this series are fantastic! The first 2 are from Jesse's POV. She's snarky and lovable, and the story is twisted and full of action. You won't see much of Jesse in book 3, as it's told by James Brinkley, Jesse's handler, and jumps between the past and present--which runs parallel to book 2. It's still just as amazing as the first 2 books, if not more so, since you get to see things happening from a different angle, plus lots of interesting details from the past that are relevant to the series overall. LOVE these books!"
5	'Very good reading. Love this series!'
5	"Very interesting sexy romance. Predictable ending, but a few unpredictable twists. Each chapter switches perspectives between the two main characters, but if you can keep up with who's mind your in it's interesting to see the character's detailed thoughts as they go about making their decisions."
3	'It was more about her life growing up on the lock and loving it, than it was about a haunting. There was very little about the haunting in the book. I enjoyed reading about her life she has a way of bringing words to pictures, but I was disappointed on the haunting aspects of the story.'
3	"I thought this book was pretty good with what he was trying to do for his sister's but there is too much left untold."
3	"I had high hopes for The Selection but unfortunately it developed into a typical YA romance story that publishers have been pushing out for the past decade. It wasn't horrible by any means but it was just mediocre. Kiera Cass had an opportunity to tell a beautiful story and intrigue the reader with witty dialogue and likable characters. For me, I gave the book 3 out of 5 stars simply for the lack of character develop and how the story progressed.\n\nThe characters:\nMaxon is the Prince and I love the whole idea of making the story as if it's the Bachelor and he's the one all the females are battling for. I liked his character but I had a hard time picturing him as I was reading. Granted, Cass did describe his looks but as the story progressed I simply forgot due to the lack of more detail from the author. I ended up imagining my own Maxon and it probably wasn't the Maxon Cass intended.\n\nAmerica....oh America. She was the only character that I really liked. I loved her attitude and her quick temper. She was very likable but I do think given more time, Cass could have made her into a very memorable character.\n\nAspen. Why was he in the story again? His character was useless to me. Yes, I see the importance of him being in the beginning of the story to set the story up and to help move it along but when he came to the palace I felt it was a premature move on Cass's part. To have his character linger to cause confusion for America is what I'm talking about with it being a typical YA romance novel. There are amazing books that only showcase two people and their journey to finding each other without having to do the whole Edward vs Jacob scenario. I really think he should have been introduced again at the end of the first book or the beginning of the second.\n\nMoving tooooo fast:\nOkay, I don't know about you but I find problems with books that progress way tooooo fast. Every time a problem arose, two pages later it was resolved. This made it to where the characters didn't fully get to bloom because they weren't allowed to really go through the issues and have them become a better or worse character.\n\nNow, I do think this book would be great on the big screen. It has so much potential and even though I basically complained through this review, I really don't think it was a horrible book. I really feel like Cass could have done a better job with the story but it was again entertaining and recommendable to teens."
2	"My kids (ages 4, 6) thought it was funny, but I thought it was pretty dumb.  It starts out with a mildly interesting premise (a boy whose life is strictly set to routines) and then suddenly people change character, laws of nature stop applying, and the boy can do any weird thing he can possibly imagine.  Just when it seems the book can't get any worse, it goes into a multi-page fart joke."
5	"The author mentions that the character, Attila, is put through a lot in this book, and that is definately the case. The story gave me some insight into gender identity and the struggles someone 'might' go through because of it. It was heartbreaking in places to know what he was going through.\n\nA previous reviewer mentioned that this is not a story about the trials and tribulations of high school. Very true. The story follows a number of characters well into their thirties(?) or more. And yes, there was a significant amount of sex and drug use, but I felt it was realistic given the story matter.\n\nI have read quite a few of this author's books and have enjoyed them all."

3	"Ella makes a decision with life and body-altering consequences. Some of the descriptions got muddled, hard to keep a mental picture going, but if the reader's taste is for extreme and out of the ordinary, this might fit the bill."
4	"This book mostly had me wondering about everything and everyone. This made me surprise most of all. Made me guessing on a lot of stuff. Not gonna lie I made a few guesses wrong. and a few of them right. I was a little disappointed in a few areas. I wanted more to happen in some areas. but that won't stop me from reading the amazing Adlynn books"
4	"Well written a genre which I'd never considered before."
4	'Karl Rogers\' new book is a must-read for anyone involved in the movement to overturn the SCOTUS decision that Senator McCain described as "the most misguided, naive, uninformed, egregious decision of the United States Supreme Court I think in the 21st century." For that matter, it should be read by all voters BEFORE the next election. Why not; it is free!\n\nReaders will come to understand how the Roberts\' court purposely set out to undermine Congressional attempts to keep for-profit corporations out of American campaigns and elections as well as the basics of corporate personhood and how money came to be ruled "protected" by the 1st Amendment.\n\nMost important, perhaps, are the excellent ideas that Professor Rogers lists at the end to not just reverse this decision, but to redirect the American ship of state away from being the corporate state it has become and back in the direction of democracy.\n\nRogers is to be commended not just for writing a highly informative and accessible e-book, but the fact that he is offering this to people without charging for it conveys his deep concern about the state of the "Republic, Lost" to use another that details the corruption endemic in the American system of corporate governance.'
3	"This short story was pleasant but predictable.  I do appreciate Mr. Graham's sensibilities.  He writes good action pieces without resorting to sexual exploitation or crude language."
1	"I don't really consider stories where there are doms and subs as love stories.  I am not only repelled by it but also offended when someone considers it romantic."
1	"The English and continuity are confusing at times. It seems anyone can publish a book these days so I'm glad I only bought the Kindle edition. It confuses you because there are no images as referred to in the text and structure of the book."

There hasn't been much detail on how the main character became attached to the Captain. I'll just have to keep reading to learn these things. It is also interesting that some sea creatures have human traits. They're called Seasort."
5	'Execellent story.  Always provide that OMG moment. Fun characters and I can always visualize them.  You always push those taboo lines and I love that.'
5	"When a heart loves so deeply it never forgets. Every moment of that love is worth the investment. Building the memories that will carry you through beyond it are worth risking the loss. Love isn't a guarantee. It is a treasure the cherish."
5	'I  sense the same energy and enthusiasm in this book as I did around 1979 when I met him personally. In this book he tells the story of his long life, starting  from boyhood, and ending with his intrernational work as a leader in the Seventh Day Adventist Church and ambassador for understanding, friendship and religions freedom. I found much of historical interest, and Christian wisdom and good common sense as well.'
1	'See title of review for details and clarification. A good effort that needs to be cleaned up and polished with vigor.'
5	'This is a great book loving it already. The book keeps you busy with its mysteries and suspense, great book'
3	'Might read another in the series.  Nothing special.'
5	'Reading this book could possibly awaken any uncontrolled anger that persons have suppressed.  To learn what has been happening to the food supply in the United States is absolutely terrible.  The control that food production corporations have over the government that is supposedly there to protect its citizens is nothing short of totally corrupt.'
5	"Love the series and can't wait to book 22 come out"
3	'I thought the story line was pretty good. It certainly took me by surprise that he was dreaming the things that happened before they actually happened. A different twist for sure.'
1	'I was not careful when purchasing this read...saw Diana Gabaldon and immediately selected one click purchase...I would be mad if I was the author of the Outlander Series and someone wrote this...I know the author says that Diana Gabaldon endorsed it as a funny read but it was NOT!!!'
5	"I'm a huge fan of this genre. And this is one of the best of the best! Five sexy sinful enthusiastic stars!!"
4	'Jane writes well, good story line. I am biased because I am acquainted with the author. However, I would recommend this read even if I did not know her and her previous work.'
5	'My friend and I have insult wars and this was perfect. I won by a landslide and he did admit that I was good.'
5	'Great storyline, great characters, full of action & humor.'
5	"I don't usually post a review...but...I really enjoyed this story and boy what a story it is...it's a little far fetched, but enjoyable. It also had some history in it..lots of stories and a very surprising ending ! I Loved it !"
2	"This is an ok game.  I will be honest, I'm kind of tired of word games being the only ones I could download on my paper white.  Some of the puzzles are really difficult, but its a nice way to exercise your mind.  It takes way too much time to complete one puzzle and you feel really tired afterward.  It's a good game to pass some time, but make sure you have the brain energy for it."
4	'A fast read, that ended too soon.  Harley\'s 21st birthday ends in tragedy, as her family and clan are slaughtered and she is "killed".

5	'this series made me download 4x space games again.'
5	"I wasn't keen on the ending but when I realized that there will be a third book, that gave me hope.  Now to just get that third book into my hands.  Well written, with a lot of action."
5	'Ive downloaded this book cause I love cakes - but Im a bit lazy :) The idea of making a cake in 5 minutes was just delightful! Ive tried 2 recipes so far   lemon mug cake and apple cinnamon. The lemon mug cake was really great   but beware -  it doubles its volume in the microwave so make sure that you use a really big mug for this one. It was really delicious!\nI tried also the apple cinnamon one  this one doesnt grow as much and its a little bit thicker. I liked it as well but I prefer the lemon one  and Ill definitely try them all!'
4	"I enjoyed this series and seeing the heroine grow. I love a strong alpha male who\nWill do whatever ever is necessary for his woman , but it's nice to have a woman who\nis his equal and will do the same for him. This story has plenty of action and intrigue\nas three different cultures come together trying to forge a relationship. Along the way bonds\nare made, enemies clash, and love is sealed with some hot sex added for a little spice."
2	'I struggled to get thru this one.'
5	"Grimm's fairy tales are known worldwide for a reason. They are the best of the best. If you've never read them, you are truly sheltered and missing out on some of the best fiction ever."
5	"Excelente but I am disappointed that you only have one of her books in Spanish.  I would love to read more of her stories and books in Spanish.  Is any way you can contact this writer?  I wish i can write her an email but I don't know where."
3	'Some elements were good, like introducing the pack soldiers, but the story was all just too simple. New plot lines were introduced w/ no supporting descriptions. No explaining motivations, things just went from one thing to another, bang. Glad it was a KindleUnlimited book.'
5	'This was a great read. I enjoyed it. Loved the characters and the plot. If you like historical romance, this is for you.'
5	"Okay, so I am 37 and have always been a small person. But in the last year and a half I have gained a whopping 30 pounds! Recently I made a promise to find a diet and stick to it.\n\nFirst of all, let me just say, this isn't a diet. For me, it's definitely a lifestyle change. It's takes some training and will power, but if you stick strictly to the plan, you will begin noticing a change within the first week. With this book I am finally learning how to eat. I feel great and my clothes are fitting looser on me.\n\nAs for the book itself, the recipes are great. I am learning recipes with new foods I probably never would have tried otherwise and so my variety of food tastes is growing. I also love the author's writing style. It really felt like she was talking directly to me as a friend. It was motivational and inspiring.\n\nThis is a program I highly recommend to anyone who is overweight or even see themselves heading there. It really does work as long as you actually stick with it."
5	'I watch the series Anon on YouTube by Diamond, I honestly think the book was even better! I have a few words for.this book: Amazing, stunning, and completely eye opening.'
4	"I love Robin Hobb's Farseer World... This trilogy is worth reading if only for insight into the different parts of the world. It is slow at times, but still worth the read."
5	"Not exactly what Reed Savage expected when he slipped into Savage Bay on Christmas Eve.  First he fell into a ditch, then to make matters worse when he finally made it to the Sinclair Mansion who does he meet up with but Kara Sinclair his best friends baby sister who is not that little girl he remembered but now a beautiful woman.  If things could get any worse they do!  He finds himself along with all the other men wearing a kilt on Christmas Eve, being kissed under the mistletoe by Kara and trying to fight down memories of why he left Savage Bay in the first place.  Reed must now meet his demon's head on, decide what and how he feels about his family, does he really just want a fling with Kara or something more and would moving back home from the West Coast work.

5	'Favorite Haberdashers book thus far... LOVE IT!  A woman full of fire, and oh my goodness...how lusty! You may need to fan yourself.'
1	'Terrible book I hated that book I only foot to the 3 chapter then I stopped reading the whole book.'
5	'I cannot get enough of this series.  It was fun to catch up with this cute couple.'
1	'Poorly formatted, very hard to navigate, no search function. I regret!'
5	"I can't wait until they make a movie out of this book! This was a fun read with emotion and excitement. Great vacation (or wish you were on vacation) book!"
3	'Mediocre but mostly enjoyable. I enjoyed learning about Mars culture, as well as more Bobbie. I mostly liked the protagonist, I just did not get fully appreciate the plot.'
1	'the writing is awful.  the rock star is an insecure dork.  i highly doubt a rock star would take a menal note of the color scheme of your kitchen.  erin comes off snooty and prude, and her nipples get erect entirely too often.  the author doesnt know much about sexy.  it came off like bad fanfiction.'
5	'I found this little pamphlet to be the\ngreatest little pamphlet, second only to\nHoly Scripture !!! Absolutely astounding !\n\nFantastic manual on how to go to confession\nand properly dispose yourself. A must read for\nevery person that knows they will one day pass\naway.'
5	'Great presentation with everything available.  Better than purchasing the paper daily and it is free.  A must for everyone daily.'
5	'I love the voice of the main character in this story. The story is told primarily through internal monologue of the main character. She seems unmoored by the tragic events that have befallen her and using the internal monologue adds to the sense that she is lost, isolated from the immediate scene and people around her. It gives a very nice effect and keeps the reader in suspense in a satisfying way.\n\nThere is some really beautiful language in the piece too. "I watch my locket image waver on the too-hot-to-drink coffee, my face a ghost-lily, my throat a white stem", "a litany of wine-dark seas and rosy-fingered dawns", "they are trying valiantly to rouse the snarling lapdog within my wifely breast, but the knife of their kindness meets nothing but stone."\n\nWhat\'s interesting and impressive to me is that, in the end, the story is a simple one and a timeless one: tragedy befalls the family and unearths the resentments between the survivors as they realize that they must rely each on the imperfect other to get through it. But the language, the perspective and the characterizations here take a familiar story and make it unique and new.\n\nI really enjoyed it.'
5	'When I explained what a multiple-path story was, their responses were so positive. They also liked a lot the fact that they feel as part of the story. Although it is easy reading, it is also really engaging. I introduced it to learners who are beginners, elementary, pre-intermediate levels and they all seemed excited to read the story and each one getting a different end. Ilustrations work is really great and for Brazilian learners who like animes/manga they easily connected it. I look forward to having more and more titles available.'
5	'This is a great book. Three stories of different people finding their loved one in the mist of trials.'
5	'I actually gave book away shortly after it arrived.  Will likely purchase another one.  Smooth transaction.'
4	'The Sanctuary by Paulette Harper Johnson portrays a very real account of what happens in relationships.  Even more, what happens in the marriages of many couples who are in the ministry.  Cedric and Lacey were long time lovers and friends, going all the way back to high school.  Blowing off the warnings to heed all signs that were present in her relationship with Cedric, she eventually got far more than she bargained for.  A successful business woman and minister in her own right, she could hold her own weight, even while maintaining her role as a wife and co-pastor to her husband.  Unprepared for how her increasing responsibilities in the ministry would affect him, Cedric blamed Lacey for all of their problems.  Against her fleshly desires to seek solace elsewhere, she gave a valiant effort to keep their marriage intact.  An intervention like only those God can do, caused all of the secrets to come to the light and be exposed so others could find their healing as well.\n\nThe Sanctuary deals with many issues in a tasteful and non-exploitive way.  Paulette does a good job of weaving the struggles and heavy issues we have to face without doing what so many do: brushing it under the rug and acting as if the problems do not exist.'
5	'really liked it'
5	"Very intriguing making one wonder can you cross the line and still hold on to that actual friendship. Would like to continue on just to see if it's possible."
4	'I enjoyed this book and actually was relieved that Riley received his happy ending'
3	'It does have Butter Beer and Pumpkin Juice (which is very complicated).  Much easier recipes to be found.  Good idea just not executed well.'
5	"great book at discovering the difference between being soul-led and spirit-led and learning to conquer strongholds....I'm reading it for the second time~ learning a lot!"
4	'A friend of mine who works inthe HR sector is always telling me crazy stories how people turn up for job interviews unprepared without having the slightest notion of what the company is all about!\nThis little booklet does its job, it\'s short and to the point just like your presentation should be,\nI was familiar with the concept of "elevator pitch", something I learned while doing my course in coaching- this technique is very handy both for job seekers and self-employed people. it\'s all about proper presentation.\nWell-written, short book!'
5	"Turning adversity into success is not a foreign concept for me. This book gives me more in depth understanding. Techniques shared by the auhor should help a person to turn adversity into success. Personally, chapter 5 resonated most with me as I've had difficulty moving forward from  rejection, tips from this book on how to handle rejection is very helpful and I shall endeavor to apply it in my life."
5	'A well written tale that is a pleasure to read; a page-turner.'
4	'I loved this book. The characters were really entertaining. I am confused about some of the reviews that indicated that the H was not an alpha male. He was but with a heart. The story really flowed and was not overly dramatic, making it totally unbelievable. There were a few misunderstandings, but they were relatable.'
4	'It was a fun and easy read. If you want to know about what a celebrity is really like off camera, this is book for you.'
5	"Devil's Due is a short novella which serves as a prequel to the upcoming novel Tokyo Black the first in an upcoming series featuring ex CIA operative Thomas Caine exiled from the service and hiding from his past in a remote city in Thailand where he gets involved in exposing a gang of ruthless human traffickers operating in the mountains of Thailand. The book is a page turner, intelligently written with strong echoes of Ian Fleming's original James Bond series which could have served as a model here as well as some conscious noir traditions from Hammett and Chandler. One is also on occasion reminded of the films of Walter Hill whose narrative frequently owes allegiance to the same literary models. The twist is that Thomas Caine operates as a stranger in a strange land in the far off cities and jungles of Thailand which the author describes in great and interesting detail which adds an appealing atmospheric density to the narrative. The action is swift and intense, the story simple but intelligent and well put together. My favorite part is the many supporting characters that Caine encounters in his adventure which are sharply drawn, original, all of them interesting, all with their own stories creating the dense world that Caine inhabits.\nIn short a thoroughly enjoyable read that bodes well for the upcoming release of Caine's next adventure."
5	'Leslie North is a captivating, talented author, who grabs your attention from the first word! Love her books, and refer all my friends!'
5	'Loved it'
2	'I enjoyed the 1st four books in this series and that is where the story should have ended. This story seemed to be written just to create another book. I am really disappointed with the author. I thought that I had found a great author where I could just buy his books and have great SF reads, but it appears that after the first four books, he just kept on writing when he should have reviewed what he was writing.\nI cannot recommend reading this book or any more books in this series. The 1st four books were great, then the story went down hill.'
5	"I just finished 12 Steps to Freedom by Paul Rega.  As a newly published author, Paul's wisdom helps me to focus in.  Not only personal development but also in my chosen career.  He lays out a path and steps in his IPA tool, Intuitive Personal Assessment, to help you achieve your goals. Author Paul Rega shares his stories, personal insights and strategies to help you succeed."
5	"This book is a practical road map to getting out of debt and building wealth in a responsible and straightforward manner. Satisfied follower's stories are peppered throughout, and help to inspire the reader no matter what their financial goals. Everything was logical and easy to follow. I don't agree with all of the assertions made, but I would recommend it without hesitation to anyone!"
5	'C.D. Gorri delivers another easy to read and suspenseful paranormal romance. Loved the backstory we got about Grazi Kelly! Characters are well formed, and the paranormal world building is unique while still retaining everything we love about werewolves.'
5	"I read many of anthony's material and it has helped me with the pick 3 lottery game although I am still working on trying to win at it. But i thank you for all the books you have made available on amazon to help me."
5	"I was a bit skeptical about reading a western that isn't contemporary, but this turned me around. The language used between the characters didn't bog me down as I feared, and it felt real. I could imagine everything that was portrayed. I highly recommend this if you are new like i was."
5	'Sarge, the first book in the F.I.S.T.S series, is an otherworldly, futuristic, kinky little gem filled with strong affection and tense military action.\n\nAs we begin, Sargent "Sarge" Wilkes, the superior in change of his unit on a dangerous mission on a alien planet, is critically injured in combat. PFL Andrew Murphy does quick work patching him up with high tech healing material and a pink goo pain killer (nicknamed Hubba Bubba) that is placed on the injured person\'s neck. Sarge\'s eye has been blown out and Murphy quickly realizes that Sarge is now blinded in his other eye too. Murphy has an idea of how to help Sarge with his blindness and sticks a relay circuit to his and Sarge\'s heads to see if the neurotransmitters from his sight will transfer over to Sarge\'s sight so they can get back to base more easily. It works and Sarge is startled to see people and objects giving off a kind of aura. Murphy has a special sight ability of seeing waves that change colors based on people\'s emotions and different situations. Once Sarge is inside Murphy\'s head, he cannot suppress his desires and Sarge picks up that Murphy, a very large 6\'8" buff soldier, has submissive tendencies and likes pain. Sarge has dominate tendencies and tells Murphy:\n\n"You\'re a good boy, Murph," he says softly to me. "you get me home, get me patched up, and you\'ll see what good boys get."\n\nAnd Murph does get Sarge safely back to base and their physical relationship begins.\n\nI can honestly tell you that this is some of the kinkiness, raunchiest, dirtiest sex I have ever read. Murph like pain and humiliation and absolutely blossoms with it. Sarge feels incredibly lucky that someone as big and manly as Murph will let him hurt him for the mutual benefit of both.\n\nAs the story progresses, Sarge and Murph become closer and their relationship turns into much more than bed buddies. The men do not express their emotions with one another, but the connection is screamingly obvious to the reader.\n\nHow can the kinkiness, raunchiest, dirtiest sex I have ever read also turn into a mind melting love story? Without either of them even expressing their feelings out loud? Well, however Bey Deckard did it, it is an astounding success.\n\nI actually cannot recommend this book highly enough. Yes, it is a short one coming in at about 50 pages, but it packs an extremely emotional punch and even had me weeping at the end. Luckily for us the sequel is already out and it\'s even better than this one! Go read Murphy now for more with these incredible men.'

4	'"This story by author John Avery is a continuation of the saga of young Aaron Quinn. It is written in a youthful style, with short sentences, high action, and mystery. I\'ve read the first book, "Three Days to Die," which was written in the same compelling style. fast paced and very well written, very much worth reading.\n\n So you are aware, I was given a copy of this book to review and glad for that.'
5	'I have been reading mysteries lately so this one was free from bookb\n\nI will be reading more of your books. Short and entertaining. Longer books take a while to read at one time. good job!!'
4	'This was a great book. The Steve character was really strange but kept you reading. I was hooked all the way to the end.'

5	'This was a good story despite only being 50 pages long. I enjoyed a dose of the holidays in June. :)'
4	"This was delightful. I gave it 4 stars because it's really a bunch of little novellas from each of the couples and doesn't really advance the story much. It's still good and highly recommend it if you're a fan of the Assassins!"
4	'Bob is a great story teller and this book proves it. For those of us who lived through Vietnam, his humor is refreshing.'
1	'ATTENTION READERS/REVIEWERS: When an author writes a book, they write what they think is their best work. Every single reader of a book is going to have a different opinion.. and that\'s okay! Do NOT let authors like Robin Renee Ray and Christie Silvers tell you otherwise. Lots of authors just appreciate that you took the time to read their work. You should not be told \'you should be ashamed of yourself!\' or having others say \'to piss her off you should have mentioned her spelling or grammar.\' Childish! ... Go with what you feel! Fortunately, I have met some WONDERFUL authors who aren\'t like these two. If you want to read some great books, check out: Nicky Charles, HP Mallory, Christi Anna, Tina Reber, or Sibel Hodge. Those are just a few that love their readers and appreciate everything.\n\nIf you\'re looking for a great paranormal read, look elsewhere! This book lacks common knowledge and has lots of mistakes. A lot of things don\'t end up making sense. If you woke up naked in front of a stranger, are you going to be comfortable to basically walk around naked in front of him? What about saying yes to marrying him that same day? Mind you, She JUST met him! I think Christi was going for a \'sexier\' Twilight but fell short.. very short! She should have taken the time to write this slowly and thought about the things she was writing. Would she want her dream man to be throwing her cat over the balcony? If she would have done this, taken the time to slowly introduce and get to know the characters instead of rushing them, THEN it could have been good. This was a quick mess! And yes.. I know i\'m going to get a "unhelpful review" from the author herself. ;) If you want a good paranormal love story, go with Nicky Charles\' paranormal love stories. She\'s a indie author who gives her books away for free and asks that you donate to your local animal shelter. :)'
5	'I have been in Thailand once before read. But after reading this book I better understand culture and cuisine. And my next trip was more fully of events and right decision were to go. It save my time and my money I recommend it.'
4	"This little book introduces the life and writings of Saint Patrick with accuracy, brevity, and clarity. It was exactly what I wanted. If you want a fuller treatment of Patrick's life you might want to consider a different book, but if you want an accessible introduction that you can read in less than an hour, look no further."
4	'These 3 stories, implausible in the beginning of each one, but providing a love found or renewed. Happiness at Christmas through giving to others.'
5	"Good series can't wait for let it snow to come out this month reade all of the series so far"
4	"A bit less plausible than Book 1 - which wasn't that plausible. But a good read with lots of action. I'd call it light entertainment."
1	"This is the worst piece of nonsense on bad relationships I've ever read, there is no cohesion, facts and with so many grammatical errors, I couldn't concentrate at all."
5	'This book is easy to read, packed full of truths written in a way that is easy to understand.  Seekers will be satisfied and believers will be challenged.  I highly recommend putting into practice the principles  and concepts taught in this book.'
5	"Police work with a touch of Indian lore. I'll definitely need to read more by this author. Great character to follow."
3	'Short fun read'
4	"This e-Book is a preview of the actual book. It's important that you read the description, as even though this is a preview of a color book, it's not intended to be colored on any devices. It's just for you to get an idea of the types of patterns you would get if you puchased the whole book. It includes links to printable .pdfs, but I did not click through those because up you have to sign up. The patterns are similar to other adult coloring bookss. They are pretty.\n\nIn the beginning of the book you get information about the benefits to coloring. This is a nice touch.\n\nOverall, pretty patterns and a nice preview of what you would get if you purchased the hard copy."

5	'Good read'
5	"I really enjoyed this book very much and more, I recommend to all adults to read, really like this author's books a lot"
5	'When is book 3 coming out? The writing of this book were very detailing.  The writer make you feel the characters pain. OMG the mother in this story needed to be killed for treating her children like dogs.  What kind of mother will do something so disgusting to her own children?  WOW...'
1	'This is not the book. It is a trivia question book. i was looking forward to a good ghost written Clancy novel but this selection sure is not it!'
5	'I have dieted my entire life. As I have gotten older fewer pounds have been shed. I followed low carb with poor results. I purchased the book after reading an article in a magazine. I realized I was not a failure,but my body was failing me. Using the guidelines in the book and really cutting back on FATS I have lost 4.5 pounds in two keeps. I am not a young chick so I want to loose the weight slow and in a healthly mamer I would suggest the program(book) to all who are struggling with their weight..'
3	"I loved the opening scene - but unfortunately for me the story dropped away about the mid-way point and then kind of got a little intense at the end. I had moments of really enjoying the story but the heaviness of abuse partnered with the erotic sex scenes complete with 'toys' didn't always gel for me. At some points I felt like I was reading about different characters ... Although I liked the writing style and differing POV's. 3 starson this one"
3	'pretty basic recipies'
4	'Great story, sad TWIST, LOVING family, stronger bond with love in the air. Beautiful babies, HOT SEXY SWEET LOVING couple, what else could you ask for.'
5	"....this book.  It was sexy and unique.  I like the fact that it kept the story centered on the main characters even the the subplot and characters gave the right amount of intrigue.  Can't wait to read more of Thayer King's work."
4	'I thought it was refreshing to read i got the 2nd book and sounding like a breaken record the cover was right on point'
1	"I could not make it past the first chapter of this book. There was no clear devision of perspectives. The story was in Sarah's view one sentence and Chris's view the next. This book is very poor written."
3	"Theses stories are good.  I had read them years ago so they weren't new, but never the less, good clean reading."
5	'Got this for my daughters 1st birthday, its a beautiful book!'
5	'Great book write an Esquel soon thank'
5	"Wow, I just loved this sweet romance.  It reminded me of some of the things I like about Georgette Heyer -- characters who have flaws but are perfect for each other, who the reader ends up loving dearly by the end of the story.\n\nThe book was shorter and easier to read than Georgette Heyer, which I didn't mind at all.  And the price!  It couldn't have been a better deal.  I definitely want to read more from this author.  It's so nice to read a romance with characters I like, that is sensual but doesn't have sex scenes.  I could feel their longing and desire for each other, and it was beautiful and sweet, but didn't cross the line with explicit scenes.\n\nAnd the author did a great job of making me like the hero.  He seemed like such a jerk at the beginning, but he developed a charm of his own, and by the end he was wonderful, a real man and a real gentleman to his beloved.  The way he confessed his love for the heroine really made me melt.  He wasn't halfhearted about it at all, which was a very pleasant surprise from a guy who started out as such a curmudgeon.\n\nFive stars all the way!"
5	"I was delighted to be given an ARC of this, the second in the Pleasure, Pain and Purpose series.\nI loved the first book, Pleasure, finding an affinity with these three women. After all, we all know the special bond a good friendship brings, so I was looking forward to reading Pain. It certainly did not disappoint. It was lovely visiting with Jasmine, Vicky and Biljana again. Getting to know them more, being a part of their lives. Pain is something we all know about in varying degrees but these three women faced it together in a way only people who know each other inside out can. I'm not going to put any spoilers, you will need to read for yourselves. But I will say this book will put you through a whole host of emotions; happiness, sorrow, anger, it has them all. A great read from Al Daltrey, I will definitely be one-clicking the third, Purpose."
5	'Very good book. Did not want to put it down.'
5	'I very much enjoyed this free read. It is a great set-up for a series and I will definitely be looking for more books from this author.'
3	'Very basic review of well-known techniques, such as SMART goals.  Useful if you know nothing.  Otherwise, would skip this one.'
5	'I could not put this book down. It was really good. It took me only a few days to read it but I think I will read it again.'
5	'I loved the opening because it took off and Icould not wait for the following.  Sarabeth was a good match for Gavin. This made a happy ending.'
5	'Not my usual genre, but it was greatly written! Loved the first one!!!'
5	"This is a life changing book. It was so amazing. So many feels!! I can't even explain it. Just read it!"
2	'Not bad, entertainment during the reading average at best. To much fantasy displayed, no structural sequence to anything. Need to do better.'
4	'but a lot of typos and misspelled words  I enjoyed the fact that the ending was a happy one\nthank you'
5	"LOVE this series. I know the story is probably coming to an end but i still can't wait for the next installment. It seems like such a short journey even though it has been over 10books and massive amounts of action throughout."
4	'I enjoyed reading this book, not x rated but a love story non the less.  Good for snowy day reading'
5	'This one hits the nail on the head. Most contemporary worship leaves me cold. The words are repetitive, the melodies are not melodical and the chord progression feel aimless. We are to the point that we don\'t even want to go to church anymore. As former church musicians, we have no where to use our talents, and feel like we get out of as much as we put into it - zilch.\n\nWe both miss the silence before the service. A time when we could settle ourselves and tune into God. We miss the well written old hymns - I would love to sing "The spacious firmament on high." The glorious words, the well crafted music that illustrates the words, ah, yes!  Maybe then I could rejoice in the Lord. We miss the "wholly otherness" of the old tunes.\n\nChurches and music leaders must understand that they are basically hanging out a sign that reads: "If you are over 40, you really aren\'t welcome. We don\'t care about your needs to worship. We don\'t want to hear about your experiences." In other words, ME DO SELF. What a bad attitude.  We have joined the ranks of the "Dones" with church. It is shame that churches are tossing out their heritages for junk. That\'s my opinion and I\'m sticking to it!! The church has left us to stave for years.'
4	'I enjoyed reading it again.  I love the language and  I had forgotten the story.  good summer read, not too much'
5	'This was a great read.  Enjoyed the ending and how the author brought the story together.  Tissues are probably needed.'
3	'I did not read the book'
5	"Very sexy , Made you hot reading it. Wish it hadn't ended so soon. The characters where very great felt like you knew them."
5	"Got my kindle and I've got my JBC again! The long awaited JBC is back and I am lovin' it."
4	"Short, hot and sweet. I loved the characters in this and the cute romance. There was also surprising depth to this short tale as well, with the MCs' struggles with the bigoted, hypocritical townsfolk. I love how that was resolved with the MCs coming out on top."
5	'Great book great story great details I like this story line. Gonna stay on the look out for more books from this author..'
1	"A friend told me it's advisable to give an author a fair chance by reading three works by that author before calling it quits.  Well, after one pathetic novel and this thankfully short novella, I can't take anymore.\n\nThe pitiful novel had a gossamer-thin plot with a subplot of sex.  In this one the plot IS sex.  The characters were drawn in invisible ink so we could hurry to the sex.\n\nOne novel and a novella is all I can stand of this.  I've served my sentence."
5	"I love this author!! Can't wait to read more!!!"
4	'I love the characters that Debora Geary creates and am always excited to read more about them.'
4	"I may have stayed up way too late reading this last night. And then was up this morning finishing it before I did anything else.\n\nA very intriguing story with great characters that had lots of depth. There were parts that didn't... well let's just say I didn't care for some of the pieces such as the sacrifices, serene's, crazy gods worshipping that involved people waiting for omens rather than using justice and logic to solve things. BUT, it was fitting for the story. So while I didn't LIKE some of those aspects, they really brought the story to life. They enhanced the setting and definitely felt like they fit for the time period that it was meant to represent.\n\nThe detail in this story was amazing and I can't explain how alive and vivid it felt.\n\nI wished at times that Tal was a little faster to figure things out. I mean, chapter one I knew his mother was an evil, conniving witch who used the general to push forward her goal of taking over. I mean, it was so clear what her plan was that I felt like for someone as smart as Tal to NOT get it sooner was frustrating.\n\nOverall, a really well done piece that springs off the page. Can't wait to get to book 2!"
4	"Ok, so this isn't literary fiction. We all knew that in advance, right? It has enough twists and turns to remain interesting although I did guess the murderer's identity early on. I should say I guessed who it was, but it wasn't confirmed such that I knew I was right until near the end when his/her identity was revealed. There were enough twists in the interim that my initial certainty wavered from time to time, so the author did well. It needs to be edited, seriously edited, by a grammarian friend of the authors who hasn't read the book more than once, or else not for at least a couple years. The sentence construction isn't bad, but incorrect and improper words are left in with enough frequency that the author either relied in herself as editor, a grave mistake, or her reading group friends read it enough times they expected the right word and let the wrong ones remain. I found these mistakes jarring to the flow of the story. I was entertained, which is what I hoped for, and I read the companion book long enough ago that I remember nothing about it. But, I recalled the author's name and that I had enjoyed the book, so I got this one, too. They aren't Jane Austen, though, and I doubt I ever re read them. The following is a generic complaint about most e-books. I bought them and own them same as my hardcover books. If I want to give or lend one of them to someone else, I can. Ownership rights to e-books should be the same. I ought to be able to give or lend any I own to whomever I please. I've lately noted announcements that this can be done on several books, so it appears times are changing. Those I read from borrowing through my library or kindle unlimited are obviously another matter. As for this book, it's really just another semi-boilerplate Highlander medieval time travel book, but that's a given going in to it and this is a better story than many I've read."
4	'Rather than write a summary/  abstract of her lovely book....It is quite apparent that our author had enormous\nthinking and feeling into her storylines  Her evident studying of the culture and language-exquisite,.  You will simply gallop through gathering her beautiful wording and  phrasing.  The\ncharacters are magical.  It is special  to have an adult fairy tale.  Possibly pushing some Russian into the story itself would force the reader to\nreally know of its origin.  MUP!'
4	'I really enjoyed all five books. Great reading.'
1	"My son couldn't even read the eBook because of bad format, words typed together, etc...audio didn't even work. Check before you buy. We've never had this happen before."
5	"Being in the UK, I have commented on this book on Amazon UK but thought I would do the same on the .com site as well to share the recommendation:\n\nI'm not a big book reader, but while browsing, came across this one. Normally my interests are U.S. Biking and Motorsport, but thought I would see how this one faired..... I was not disappointed.\nGreat background story and it kept me wanting to see what happened next. Some of the situations read true to life, especially if your into the biking scene.\nRecommended, and an author I will be keeping an eye on, in the future. Hope you enjoy as much as I did."
5	'The whole series is worth reading.!'
1	'This plot goes with all the teenage cliches.  The smart naive teenage girl torn between the known and the unknown. It gets tiring.  And too graphic.'
5	"I'll definitely be reading the author's remaining books. There was so much immediately practical information in this book! Good read"
5	'Series kept me on my toes and was a great read during my leisure time. I recommend all  Jade Jones books.'
1	"Well intended, and an interesting enough little cautionary tale about paxil.  It just doesn't contain that much useful info.\nAnd while I did borrow it on prime, thats a perk I do pay for, so I'm a bit angry to have wasted my monthly borrow on a ten minute read.  Please don't mistake this for a book... it falls somewhere between a short article, and a rant.  Very dissapointing."
3	'Hard to listen to as it sounds very robotic. Hiring someone with a pleasing voice would make this a lot better.'
5	'I enjoyed this sweet adventure of a dragon and his friends.  This would be a good story to read to my grandchildren a chapter at a time.  The descriptions and actions of the characters are charming and still leaves room for our imagination.  It is well written and gives opportunity look up or explain definitions to the readers.  I love that there is room for another adventure at the end.  I would recommend for ages 4 and up.'
4	'This was one of those cross-genre books, part Western romance and part North American mysticism.  The combination worked well in this book.  Two men who were friends, when they were alive, join forces to protect the next generation.  Through the adventures of the young people, they uncover a past that they had no idea they all shared.  Past hurts need to be forgiven, so they can move on to the future.'
5	'So glad tony got another happy ever after. He was so sad and lonely.'
5	'Opened my eyes...... I never have been one to pray. This encourages me to take the next steps in learning to hear God'
5	'I read all 6 books in this series. The characters are fun, and they all seem to choke on food all the time when they get "hormonal". The author has a sense of humor.'
4	'A very good lesson book for your guitar learning arsenal.  I started learning guitar going straight into lessons that taught chords and licks and while you do pick up some info about notes on the guitar these lessons never went back to build that foundation of where all the notes lie on the fretboard.  After two years of beginner lessons, I am ready to get deeper into music theory.  I picked up this book to fill in a gap I felt I had with knowing the notes along the entire fretboard from memory.  It is a straightforward approach using some things I had learned in other lessons and adding some new.  The best part was the approach to practice and memorizing in the lessons.  I have stopped some of the aimless noodling and moved back to a more structured practice plan with some of the practice suggestions in this book as part of my intent to move on to more advanced lessons.  It is a short easy read and well structured approach to memorizing the fretboard.  The key to making this work is practice, practice, practice.'
5	'It snowed al, day yesterday, so I read all day.  "Undertow" what a book!  Just could not put it down.  I heartily recommend this book.  Only one complaint....there are no other books by Elizabeth O\'Roark.'
5	"This a very emotional story that delivered more of a story then I thought it would.  It's one of those books that you hate to put down and sad when you finish because you want more. I definitely want more of this story."
5	'Short BUT oh so powerful. I love reading stories about mafia romance and I can that this author will surely become one of my favorite ones to read.'
4	"All the SEAL series is  worth the read.  (Of course, I'm a big SEAL fan to begin with.) The characters, men and women are both strong. Plenty of romance and suspense to grab your interest. After the Hold series I recommend The Shadow Series. Stephanie Tyler knows how to tell a story."
4	"The book was sad and a little slow but the end was sweet and gave me a good (happy) cry. Wouldn't be a first pick but I'm glad I read it."
5	"If I was writing an eBook about life coaching, how to be a life coach and launching a life coaching business, this would be it. It's one of the better beginning, get your feet wet, kind of books available currently on Amazon.com. I was thoroughly pleased with the writing. The text and topics were well organized. I even found myself taking notes on various things I wanted to look into further.\n\nThis is a great, well rounded, introduction into becoming a life coach!"
4	'The story takes a turn in the Alien storyline by bringing survivors of Aliens back to Earth and 30 years have passed. Add government cover ups, evil corporations and the same derelict space craft and you have what you need for a standard alien story. If you liked the first 2 movies and felt let down by the third movie, you will enjoy this twist in the storyline. It also starts asking the logical  questions about the origin of the DSC. Fun to read and nostalgic.  I hope they continue the plot in another book.'
5	'Nice book in spanish, so easy to read and very helpful. I really recommend it.'
4	'what a delight - a 2nd book as good as the first in the series.'
5	"This is an excellent e-book version of Aristotle's classical book on logic, epistemologic and rhetoric. The navigation throughout the book is excellent. You can go easily from Priors analitics to sofistical refutations. I read the whole book and it was very useful to have it in this version. I was reading meanwhile I was in the subway, the bus or even the airplane. The content itself of the book is excellent. Aristotle is a must-read if you want to know more about philosophy, science and methodology."
3	'First off allow me to admit that I am a huge fan o the Dresden series as well as the Furies of Calderon.  In my mind a person would need to go a long way to equal those stories.  Where this book makes a decent start, it is not quite there.  I see potential, so I will await the next book because I know Butcher to be a master at spinning tales.'
4	'It was ok.  wanted something with more info on the characters earlier in the book.  Almost like it put everything at the very end.'
5	"Good read- wish Id read it a few years ago! I hope you write more inspiring books like this.\nIt's very easy to read and its very nice advice that gives me hope. thank you."
4	"Interesting story of an interesting man. Helps you understand the reasoning of a very clever individual. Wort a read that's for sure"
5	"I never tire of reading books on meditation even though I'm a novice meditator. I always pick up something new. Similarly, in this book, I've picked up a technique that I can do anytime, anywhere. I will now start to monitor my watch for one full minute, focusing on my breathing. The author says people have taken a year or more to master this simple technique. This is definitely a good buy for me."
5	'Loved this book from beginning to end.\nSo eager to read the rest.\nA different kind of medieval romance.\nRecommended to all readers of historical romance.'
5	"I've read all of her books about Blossom Street and loved every minute of all of them."
5	'While the stated purpose of this book by pastors Alan and Nancy Smith is to help singles find their mate, it is so much more. Like everything they teach and write, this book is about the empowerment of knowing who you were created to be and the freedom in that empowerment.'
4	"I related to this story. It has some similar themes to a brief relationship I was in that did not turn out so well. Maybe that's why it was such an emotional read for me.  While the authors were probably going somewhat for brevity and the story and characters could have been more fleshed out and drawn out, it was still a very good read for me. I fell in live with both guys."
2	'Only about 10 people in the government could do anything with what is written in here.  It is a good book but really as possible as electing the sun for president.'
5	'If you want something to read and take your mind off of troubles these are definitely  the books to read.'
5	'Awesome storyline.....loving this book....anxious for book 3!!'
5	'One of the Best book I have ever read.'

5	'I just finished reading this book and I am so blown away! It\'s after 1am, and I have to be up for work tomorrow, but I was just had to finish. I am still reeling from the heights I\'ve been lifted to, and the lows that I cried over. I know this is a story that will be with me for a long time. . .\n\nDavid and Ryan meet as freshman in highschool, in 1968. The story is told from David\'s point of view. I don\'t know much about being gay in this era, and Mr. Skinner does a great job of showing not only the conservatism and homophobia, but also the acceptance of the era of "free love". As David and Ryan grow as a couple, they find and surround themselves with an amazing group of friends and family. Their relationship has the inevitable periods of becoming closer as well as drifting apart, but they remain solidly in love with each other, and far more mature than the average teenager. They have the usual adolescent fears and hopes for the future, but because both of them are so real, such a fascinating mix of innocent and complex, I never felt there was anything ordinary about their story. As they plan their way around Ryan\'s father\'s bullying, working out a way to have a life together despite different interests and ambitions, you start to see the happy ever after, with only a little foreshadowing. . .\n\nAnd when tragedy strikes, it is complete. And all the hope and love in the world cannot change the facts.\n\nAnd then it is compounded by betrayal.\n\nBut life goes on, and some happiness can never be regained. And the lesson is that one can only be happy to have experienced it, and that kind of love truly is a once in a lifetime gift. The last page of the book leaves you with a hope for recovery, but the author wisely leaves it at that, and the readers can only imagine how David\'s life plays out from there. I, for one, imagine happiness.\n\nIt was not just the story and the wonderful characterization that drew me in, though. The descriptions of David and Ryan\'s love for each other, for their friends, for David\'s family, is so touching and real I can\'t even describe it. There is no explicit sex, but what descriptions there are, Wow. Their first time together (which occurs well after they declare their love):\n\n"It was a night of many firsts. Mutual learning and teaching Tentative explorations: curious experimentations. There\'s nothing quite like the experience of first knowledge. We quake under it, thrill to it, learn from it and get consumed by it. Unnumbered heartbeats and breaths collide with the flux of sensations and thoughts that delight, confuse, and surprise as two people open themselves to each other. There\'s nothing to compare it to, and it will forever be a standard of it\'s own"\n\nThe rest of the writing is equally beautiful. I feel so inadequate even trying to describe it, but just want to say READ THIS BOOK! I would not call it YA, even though the characters are young, and the sex is off page. This is one of those books, like A Separate Peace which is referenced in here, that has lessons and challenges for adult readers as well. I will be reading again. And I am definitely going to look into other works by this author.'
3	'The book is ok, but I did laugh out loud a few times. Even some of the funny observations are old and worn ("humans have only continued to procreate because women clearly forget the pain of giving birth!!!  HAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!")\n\nDear author: Here are a few gifts for your next book.  ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; Please use them.\n\nThe author DESPERATELY needs to learn to use commas and semicolons correctly.  And sentence breaks now and again would be appropriate too.\n\nA couple examples to give you feel for the quality of writing:\n\n- Sitting, shaking in the middle of our kitchen, like she was in an industrial freezer, Pygmy waited.\n- It was Friday and it was time for yet another weekly midwife appointment, this week, we were meeting with Teresa again.\n- It would have been nice to know that cold water could stir the baby to move, fifty thousand needless calories, spiraling towards gestational diabetes, worth of Nutella earlier.\n- Huh, apparently the threat of my penis alone was enough to get things moving down there, not too shabby.\n- This bought me some time to, frustrated, poke my head out of the room every two minutes to look for Nina.\n- We had past that point by over an hour. (OH JESUS)\n- I wanted every movement and moment in her line to be perfect.  (minor, but this happened frequently)\n(PS - the plural of "Lego" is "Lego blocks" or "Lego bricks".)\n\nMostly I found myself in disbelief at many of the situations.  Maybe it was fabricated for the book...?  Several ultrasounds in the first couple months of pregnancy?  Thinking the fertility testing clinic was going to be like a high-end whore-house?  Even getting a fertility test when you haven\'t TRIED to get pregnant yet?  And what was with the obsession over finding the perfect curtain \'rod\' branch for the nursery?  Maybe if I didn\'t know a thing about pregnancy and birth this would be funnier.\n\nFrequently the side-bar situations would be sort of funny, then go on too long and lose the humor.  Then he\'d jump right back into the story with zero transition or warning.  I found myself flipping back a couple pages to even figure out what question this character was answering.  With all the grammatical issues and this uneven story flow, I find myself wondering where the hell was the editor??\n\nAnd now, two funnies:\n\n- We sat in the waiting room for nearly forty five minutes without peeing or eating, which was a pretty big accomplishment. Alas, Peanut had had enough and decided to man the helm, steering Ellen\'s avatar to the front desk. I could imagine the little voice in her head "Mother! Seek food! Do as I command!" (Funny, but still missing a comma...)\n\n- As the conversation went on, I began to regret that we had made the decision to have children so soon. Clearly, I needed more time. I just couldn\'t keep up with the frantic pace my wife had set. Somehow, she had squeezed seven years of medical school into the first five months of pregnancy.'
4	'The stories are entertaining, old-style SF, and they\'re by a nascent Silverberg, which is quite okay by me, since I always enjoyed his unpretentious early pulp yarns moreso than his later, more "sophisticated" ones (great though those are regarded by a good many Silverberg aficionados). I find these early ones to be no less imaginative, but stylistically and thematically less complicated and not as overly developed. In other words, mindlessly fun.\n\nThere\'s one possible formatting problem, however. On a Kindle Paperwhite the text of the stories MAY be a tad lighter than usual. This is likely not an issue with every device, so be sure to sample this and any other Megapack you may be considering before actually purchasing it.\n\nUPDATE 11/08/17: Now that the most recent Paperwhite upgrade (5.8.11) permits users to make the font darker by going to "Aa" and choosing a desired level of boldness, reading this is as pleasing as previous Megapacks. Thus, the "problem" I mentioned above is no longer a concern.'
2	'ok. not a great read.'
3	'I was nice to see the wife opening up sexually, and was certainly erotic to read.  Would like to see where this lead to.'
5	"I'm glade I took a chance on this author.though it is not a easy read the characters and story line make up for it. I bought the sequel"
5	'2 thumbs up'
5	"If you like Regency era romances you'll love this book.  Even if this isn't your normal genre it was a fun, light hearted read. It had the perfect combination of humor and history.  Unlike many ebooks I've read I didn't notice any major errors or even typos."
2	'Some stories are better than others but overall the book was not that great. Most stories were just boring.'
4	"Every book Shanora Williams writes is SO different from the last. But they all have one thing in common: they are straight up crack (as in addicting).\n\nDrake, AKA Doom, is a badass alpha, but not your typical caveman who grunts and doesn't speak in complete sentences. I wanted to throat punch Jenny at times. But don't worry. She found her back bone, eventually.\n\nDoomsday Love is split up into two halves: the past and the present. The last half was definitely my favorite. I loved to see these characters grow and find their way back to each other. If you like MMA romances and/or second chance romances, give Doomsday Love a try."
3	'I\'m writing this review thinking mainly about what else could have happened to Hollyleaf. (SPOILERS) God, how long has Fallen Leaves been living?? The Ancients are older than Starclan, and Fallen Leaves is the son of one of the Ancients, (I can\'t remember which), and he\'s been alive until now. (He "tragically" got lost in the tunnels trying to become a warrior, and he thinks somehow his mother will come back to look for him, even though his mother has been long dead). And he\'s been in the tunnels in all following events/books, including the Dark Forest Attack? Why didn\'t Fallen Leaves die? He\'s been alive for ages! Anyways, he helps Hollyleaf, (supposedly for company), yet when Hollyleaf is healed, Fallen Leaves now gets irritated with her? So he wants her to stay, and leave? And, Hollyleaf helps a fox cub! Not to be over-realistic here, (despite these books being fictional), a cat would not help a main predictor of cats, even in young form. It makes no sense. She even thinks when the fox grows up it will be FRIENDS with her. Wow, Hollyleaf either is one idiot or she has lost her mind alone in the tunnels. Out of instinct, that fox while severely injure/kill her the first second it gets. Also, the book only covers a couple months of her life, rather than a lifetime. Although it does do a good job of leading up to the part where she gets discovered (and surprisingly does not contradict any of the other books), it should go on at least a little more, to tell what she felt when she got back to Thunderclan. I mean she was basically stalking Thunderclan. She "helped" them, but she was really just obsessed, (in an unhealthy way), with Thunderclan. She us giving prey and herbs to them, as well as just going down there to sneak looks and peeks at the warriors. Um.......y-y-yea, i-i-i think she kinda went over the top!! Anyways, if she was that desperate, why just not go back. It\'s not like anyone else besides Jayfeather and Lionblaze (MAJOR-MAJOR SPOILER) are going to know SHE was the one who killed Ashfur, and not Sol. But overall, the storyline was good, it\'s just the weird and logic issues that really irked me'
5	'This cookbook is a goldmine for people who want to cook healthy food. The useful recipes have helped me a lot. Thank you!'
5	"Very helpful set of tools (not rules) that have helped me organize supporting characters around my protagonist's flaws and goals, rather than more distant plot issues."
4	"A must read for all in pursuit of dreams.  Melvin's journey and growth are seeds for those who will listen.  Along with my family n friends we enjoy Tyler's talent and have purchased, attended,\nand supported his many works.  Both men are applauded for their committment and perseverance.  No success is ever enjoyed without cost...I pray the causalities do not include personal integrity, familial ties and broken spirits.  Thank you for these words that teach your son to not let his passion give way to blind loyalty."
5	"I loved the way the story developed! There were a few twists that I didn't expect. I felt immersed in the world the author created."
5	"This was a sweet, short and sexy read.  I enjoyed their banter back and forth, as well as, the sexual attraction between the two players.  Johnny and Fiona work together and have known each other for a number of years.  They have shared a few kisses over the years, but always resisted getting involved because of their pasts and work situation.  But when Viola's friends get sneaky at the Valentine's dance and pair the two together for the night, it turns out to be way more than either of them planned on.\nI was given an ARC by NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."
4	'Great conclusion to The Manhattan Stories. This author is a very good story teller. Be sure to read the books in order.'
4	"I love Michael's writing. I've read quite a few of his works and have enjoyed them all. This is a very good collection of short stories."
4	'A truly romantic story and it keep you wanting more. I had a hard time putting the story down I just wanted to keep reading. I hope there will be more short stories to come.'
1	'The novel is very bad, the protagonist is traveling all the time, knowing her daughter did not produce any emotion, it is slow and boring'

5	'Once I found a lamp and rubbed it, a genie emerged and gave me three wishes: I wish for an endless supply of salad greens, I wish my ex boss would have chronic stinky feet for the rest of his life, and I wish Jeff Strand would write that fourth Andrew mayhem novel ALREADY! That bastard genie messed up the first two wishes, but the third he got spot on!\n\nJeff Strand is my favourite writer, he disturbs me a lot, he makes me laugh even more and I\'m in awe of the shirts he wears in promotional photos. Lost Homicidal Maniac (Answers to "Shirley") was a great read, I started it and didn\'t put it down until the end, in that time I laughed, giggled, cringed, screamed like a girl, made a yucky face, and got genuinely emotional; a tear fell onto my Kindle.\n\nI\'m most pleased with this fourth novel about the extremely unlucky Andrew Mayhem. Can\'t wait for the fifth.\n\nP.S. Did I mention I love Jeff Strand?'

All opinions are my own.\n\nThis was a really fun read - and being the wife of a college professor, I identified with the world of academia that Adam Harkness lived in before his tango lessons!  I often see people who put their academic life before their personal one and who need a push to develop a personal life!  I've never thought of tango lessons... but hey, when it's a great idea, it's a great idea!\n\nI loved the fact that two smart and lovable people were in the right place at the right time and you can read how they overcame themselves to find a happy ending!"
4	'This is light story on a personal level that one can understand.  I think the author did a good job in creating a story that made a person think that some things will work out and for the better.'
5	'So many O/A members are confused by the term "abstinence".  An amazing book.  Inspiring.  A must for all O/A members.  One of the best publications from O/A.  Get it.'
5	'I love a good cozy mystery and this one doesnt fail. Entertaining and well-written! Easy to read yet the reader is presented with many potential suspects all woven into a small town atmosphere. I look forward to reading more of Debra Burroughs books.'
4	'I enjoyed this books, the romance, the story plot, the outcome, and the sense of realness. I am so happy I was gifted a copy this book from the author so give my honest review. And honestly it is a very good, hot, sexy, HEA , need to add to your collection type of book.\n\nReviewed by JustaBooklovinJunkie'
5	'I just love this book it was a page turner from the beginning to the end "Great" job. Cann\'t wait to see what\'s next.'
3	"This is an okay story that is enjoyable, which most people will do enjoy. But i do admit it does get a bit predictable when it doesn't really delve into other ideas and as usually just focuses on love between two people...It is a good read though and a good time passer."
3	"3 - Thats a real gift youve got there Stars.\n\nThe second book in the Montana Born Christmas duology didn't quite live up to the high standards of its predecessor. To say the story-line between Sawyer and Jenna was a slow burner would be a bit of an understatement.\n\nI think the main issue that I had with the book is although it can completely be read as a standalone, a large portion of this book sort of rehashes a lot of what happened in Kat Lathams offering Three Nights before Christmas but is told from a different couple perspective.\n\nI can kind of understand that there isn't going to be a huge amount of sexy times between a couple who are dealing with a broken leg and Chicken Pox between them, but the chemistry from being holed up and quarantined together should have been intense and constant, and I didn't get a lot of connection from this couple for a good 75% of the book.\n\nAn easy enough book to read, I just expected a little more from this couple in the attraction stakes, there is a huge amount of internal monologue, but very little action.\n\nARC generously provided via Netgalley, in exchange for the above honest review."
4	'In light of purchasing a new dog... this was an easy quick read and simple to understand... It will continue to be a quick reference for me.'
5	"One of the best reads I've had. I want to follow up with other things the author has written."
4	"Okay, it was cute. Though I personally didn't like the character development I gave it four stars because I liked certain aspects of the story a lot and he gets points for being unique. I thought it was laid back and some parts were pretty funny. If you're just looking for a funny story and a cute read, it's a perfect book for you and I really loved the title. As you're reading you follow several different stories about several different groups of people until the moment when the puzzle pieces fall into place. The author was able to tie everything together in the end but I think he waited a little too long to do it, but if you stick it out, I promise you it will bring light to the whole situation."
5	"C. G. Cooper makes an immediate connection with the reader with his character Daniel Briggs. To the point that I marvel at how he did that. I became an immediate participant in Daniel's intimate story, so much so that I finished the book in one sitting."
5	"Pastor Joseph Parrish Thompson was instrumental during the civil war. He was a fascinating man of incredible integrity. Mary Loncoln Todd gave him president Lincoln's cane after he was murdered. He was a friend to the president besides a pastor."
5	"This well-written brief account of Abraham Lincoln's life from early childhood to death reveals insights into the man of which I had not been aware.  It tells of his personal life as well of his politics and the reason he was assassinated."
4	'This book was a good MC story. The ending, however, is driving me crazy! I need to know what is going to happen to the 2 main characters! I read this in 1 day, definitely hard to put down!'
1	'Narratives are not natural -- too much attempts at explaining history of Texas within a conversational situation.'
5	"I can't get enough of Lorne! A female detective made very realistic by a wonderful author, what more could you ask for."
5	"Very well written. Keeps you on your toes wanting to know more. Just when you think you've solved one mystery the plot twists and the answer us the least expected. As someone who's watched cancer destroy and bring families together this was refreshing to read about all the real & different emotions people feel, during, and after cancer. Highly recommend."
4	"This was different sort of Christmas short story idea. The author indicates at the beginning of the book that she happened upon a discussion about overused, groan-worthy clichs in m/m fiction and decided to have a bit of fun constructing a story that included them all. I'm a fan of satire in general, and this was a good one. It played out almost like a skit, the lumberjack meets modernized city boy, but the characters are interesting enough that it went beyond simply being tongue-in-cheek and evolved into a cute little romance. The conflicts, though cliched, were explained well, developed, and resolved. The dialogue and overall writing flowed well, and the pacing was steady. There is insta-love, but that's a given in a parody of romance novels. I did like how Grand had the characters acknowledge the crazy situations or the silliness of the tropes. It was a clever way of poking fun but also developing the story line. I thought the characters came off likable but a little underdeveloped. I'm not entirely sure how much of that is due to time constraints within a short story, but I felt like we just scratched the surface with their personalities. I think a little more humor may have evened out the book more for me as well, because I really appreciated the banter between Aiden and Tristan when they got going. Overall, found this approach to be fresh and fun to read. It was a perfect light-hearted but sweet story to enjoy around the holidays.\n\n*Alpha Book Club received a free copy of this e-book to read and review. The publisher and author had no influence on my review*"
5	'Brent and Hayden, this is their story.  We saw them in a previous book.  Face palm to Brent.  Honestly sometimes the man was.... yes.  Just that.\nThis was another great book in the series and plenty of steam.  Bring the spare panties.'
4	'Quick easy reading activity for toddlers. With creativity, lots of fun too.\nThe imagery is just enough for getting your toddler ready to read digital books.'
4	"While slow to start; this story quickly picks up steam and really pulls you along. It feels like a series of novellas or a serial strung together and the writer's development and improvement grows with each installment. Not literature, but good Military SciFi."
4	'Good read, lots of detail. You can tell a lot of research went into this book.  Very interesting resd.'
3	'I found that the pace moves too slowly.  The clues are written too small and are not visually positioned well.'
4	'great. A good read'
5	"I didn't read the synopsis of this book before I bought it, I bought it based on the authors previous books and I wasn't disappointed. Kaior, Cha and Tissa are friends til the end and have each other's back. This book had me from page 1 and it shows why you shouldn't mix business with pleasure. Great job Chanel"
5	"Enjoyed!  Can't wait to read more!"
5	'Letty is enjoying her opportunity to redefine herself in college.  When she walks into her class and sees one of the guys who tormented her through high school, she is brought right back to those difficult days.  When they start interacting more, he does his best to make amends with her and she starts to realize that maybe there is more to him than she previously thought.  This story was great and I loved the character development throughout.'
4	"Police and psychic abilities join to find out why people are being murdered.\n\nThis stand-alone story is a compelling read.  Believable characters with distinct personalities and great dialogue.\n\nIt is not always clear regarding change of subject and has a few editing issues.  Not all questions are answered, especially about Tessa's childhood and insurance payments.\n\nGang Detectives:\nCleary was a short, muscular African-American. His stained T-shirt stretched tight across bulging biceps and his jeans showed two inches of patterned boxers. A gold tooth gleamed when he smiled. If he had bathed the night before, he must have used eau de muskrat.\n\nIf Ruben hadnt known the man was a cop, he would have crossed the street to avoid him. All the gang detectives looked, dressed, and smelled like the people they were trying to infiltrate. They probably did more to keep the streets of Houston safe than two dozen patrolmen, and in return, decent citizens shunned them.\n\nI may re-read this story and look forward other works by this author."
3	'What could have been a great book became a good story because an editor was needed to correct grammatical and punctuation errors.'
4	"4 stars\n\nThe Billion Dollar Player was a quick fun and enjoyable read.\n\nJase and Avery are perfect for each other. They both have baggage and a relationship wasn't something either was looking for but once they started opening up to each other it was hard for either one to let the other go.\n\nI couldn't put this novella down, I really enjoyed it, my only complaint would be the end felt a little rushed.\n\nLooking forward to Luke's story next in Rocked by the Billionaire."
5	'Excellent story. Well written with interesting characters. Warning!! All of his books are very difficult to put down once you start reading them. Neighbors is certainly no exception. I highly recommend this story for all the King and Koontz fans. Jeremy is fast becoming one of my favorite authors.'
4	"I enjoyed this installment of the rain falls series. Can't wait for the next one to find out what happens."
5	'I am a ten year old girl and I loved this book. I have read all of the julia jones and mind reader books. I liked how the characters expressed their feelings and thoughts. This was a verry exciting book I loved it:)'
5	'This is a sweet story of hope and resilience.  Ruby  finds love and contentment in Nowhere Texas after being sent away from the orphanage she grew up in. Strong characters and a heartwarming story keep the pages flying by.'
3	'A nice bedtime story.  Nothing so graphic as to give you nightmares, but sets a nice tone and puts you in a mood to be scared a little more...'
4	"There wasn't to much to set this book apart from the other erotica stories.  The characters were easy to relate to and kept me interested.  The story was a little too short for my liking.  By the time it started to get really interesting it ended.  I wouldn't say a cliffhanger, but there's certainly more story to tell.  I clicked this book during a free promotion a few months back.  3.5 stars"
5	"Chains is t.h. snyder's first foray into the erotica genre and she nailed it! This may only be a novella, but it is packed with angst, pent up frustration, and sex. Hot, steamy sex.\n\nJesika is a fashion photographer dating a successful attorney, Connor. When he reveals his lifestyle to her, she runs the other way. Fast forward a year later, Jesika's sassy best friend, Ashley, forces her to go out and have some fun at The Club, an exclusive, secret sex club.\n\nConnor can't get Ashley out of his mind, even a year later. He visits The Club often to try and forget about her. Until the night he sees her there, looking very sexy but afraid and unsure.\n\nTheir meeting at The Club provides another chance to be together. Will Jesika let go of her fears and trust Connor? Can Connor show her the passion and love that she craves?\n\nIf you have read other books by t.h. snyder this is not her typical novel. Her crossover to the erotica genre is flawless. Her writing is elevated to the next level and I hope us readers are given a full length novel similar to Chains.\n\nAshley\nBook Crazy Gals"
3	"This was not the whole 'book'. It was free but..."
4	'Mostly clean, no bad language. Likeable main characters. Needed more building up of their relationship before they were smitten. Story felt hurried and skipped over large chunks of time, but it worked as a short little romance.'
5	'Loved this 2nd book in the Business Or Love saga.'
3	'I wish there was a lititle more to the story, I need some more closer. Overall a great story'
4	'I got this book for FREE when I did a search of the top 100 the other day ... after getting a mixed assortment I started reading this one & was so hooked I read it in a day!\n\nThe thing about a book like this is that it enables complete escapism into a chicklit world! The characters are not average, the situations are far fetched... BUT... I loved it! Sometimes, I don\'t want to read a story that\'s real - I want one where I laugh, muse and cheer for the characters.\n\nI thought the main characters had everything that is great about British humour - it\'s so dry (especially with men!) I also liked the depth to the story and underlying issues that surrounded the central characters. So much more going on than a lazy spoilt rich girl.\n\nNot sure it is like Pride & Prejudice at all though. If you liked Bridget Jones - this is the book for you. The central male character had "hints" of Darcy, but in my opinion is nothing like him. He works hard for a living, Darcy was a "gentleman". Natalie is definitely more Bridget Jones than Elizabeth Bennett!'
4	'Cute book and age appropriate'
4	'I always like time travel romance I love how they go back and figure thing out then want to stay'
5	'Just as good as the first two books. Not only does it deliver a great story, it pounds in the chilling reality of life.\n\nWhere someone sees liberation, another sees opportunity.'
4	'I liked this a lot. It was the perfect mix of adventure, magic, technology, and romance. Lots of danger and difficult choices confront Hailey and her friends. I also found it a novel twist on magic and the type of world in which it unfolds.'
5	'Truly enjoyed this book.  I love mysteries.  Quick read.'
5	"I can testify from my own NDE that what Mr. Storm describes is very much consistent with my experience, with the exception that I never travelled outside the light. I can understand his not wanting to write the book for many reasons, but I'm certainly glad he did. I found his experience as a validation for things I've personally wondered about both before and following my NDE. I thank him for writing and bringing new motivation to myself and my family. There are so many things I know he didn't write about because there just aren't words to describe it all, but this certainly gives the reader very good insight into what our Father intends for us in this life. It's rare that I feel comfortable even talking about my own experience so I am impressed that Mr. Storm has shared this and I hope that every reader finds meaning within their own life that will lead to an improvement of our existence in the days we have here."
4	"A good read for a mystery, I would order another in the series. I don't know why you need seven more words."
5	"I loved it and could not put it down... needless to say I have already bought #2 in the series and can't wait to get started..."
5	'The graphics are full screen in landscape view, with the text on each picture.  Perfect viewing on my 7" Kindle fire HD.  Very attractive pictures and good morals.  The experience is as good as viewing pictures in a traditional kids picture book.  I did not find the book preachy as one viewer suggests.'
5	"This was a pretty good read and my children love to check out science books. It was pretty informational with the diagrams although I do wish there weren't so many stock images in between the diagrams and the other informational pictures. Besides that it was a decent book and my family seemed to enjoy it. I would definitely recommend this easy book to my family and friends.\n\nI received this item at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. Good or bad, my reviews are based on my personal experience with the product."
5	'he did it again.'
5	'I had once read a book on storytelling - a nice one..\nI tried to use the method mentioned in the book..\nBut you know, though the book gave a lot of examples, it did not give a concrete path..\n\nThis book is way different from that.\n\nHow?\n\n- The basics of a business story is shown\n\n- Constructing a story is clearly guided\n\n- Benefits of a story\n\n- Framing, planning and planting are shown\n\nA definite recommendation'
5	'This is the perfect resource for the team leader, manager or anyone who needs to plan, design, conduct and evaluate meetings within an organization. Tom covers all of the basics that an internal facilitator should be aware of and cover off when managing meetings.\nI would highly recommend "Meeting Hero"  to those who run meetings within an organization. It will be a good solid resource to help you get through 99% of the various situations you will encounter. If you are a freelance professional facilitator this will not be your cup of tea.'
4	'Interesting story with a little different slant of art as a thread through the family. The mysteries and twists and turns are fascinating while the age/stage of the protagonist becomes slightly repetitive for someone older than dirt who vaguely remembers the obsessions with alcohol and sex of the late teens and early 20s.  The writing is alright. The stories and mysteries are captivating. What lee[s ,e reading twos series os wanting to know how it all turns out for her.  Worth the time and effort.'
5	"I'm loving this series!!\nI'm loving watching Sal grow in confidence, powers and relationships.\nLove Jase and Sal, but I can't decide who I want to be within Sal next...\nCan't wait for more!"
4	'Nice to post or copy out for student use. I find it pretty simple for adults but do enjoy it.'
5	'This is a story ripped right out of todays headlines.  Children who grow up in fear become adults who live in fear.  How easier the world would be if we just loved and cared instead of judging and tormenting.  I highly recommend this story.'
5	"RAR. Andre! If he does not come CLEAN before this serial is over, I am going to be wickedly irritated! Poor Cela. And then Foster! He tells Andre that he should come clean with Cela, but then he drags his feet, not taking his own advice! MEN.\n\nBoth of them need to come to their senses!\n\nBasically I am totally sucked in and loving it. I can't wait to reread this later, when I have all the pieces together. I'm still not 100% sold on the serial format, but I don't even care, because Roni Loren's writing is great, regardless of how it's delivered!"
5	'i have never regretted my choice of any of my selections and the download always trouble free. A WONDERFUL AQUISITION'
5	"Outstanding could not stop reading it can't wait for the follow up novels."
5	'Great addition to the series.  I really enjoyed reading the first two and thought this one was even better.  Fun kickass characters, looking forward to the next one!'
5	'It was a really decent read. Very nice job. I look forward to hearing more about these two and stuff.'
5	'Just finished this very well written book.  I just loved it. I was captured\nby the characters, the twists in love, the humor that makes you feel that you are\nright there with her as she is telling the story.\nExcellent book!  I am sad that I have finished it! I want more!'
4	'Really great book. Nicely organized by themes. Lots to choose from. Themes like acceptance, balance, letting go, grounding, etc. you can stick to the script provided or use it for ideas. One important thing I learned from the book is to stick to one theme throughout the class. Its structured in a way, with enough content per theme, to open and close the class with engaging message.'
5	'Dearest River,\n\nSimply put thank you. Thank you for taking such a sensitive topic and making it okay. Okay to admit Hey that was me! As I sit here and type this letter Im honestly in tears, crying for a past I over came, crying at this amazing novella that has resonated so deeply into my soul and being.\nIm solo (hehe) in awe how your ability to take our discussions and turn certain tid-bits from them into something beautiful. Something Im not ashamed to admit I went thought.\n\nI cant review Reclaimed I can only relate, respect and be completely in love with it. I thought I loved Nix and Kadence before, but holy cow do I now. No one in the Kights MC will ever top them for me now, not after witnessing them overcoming this! Together, as a team!\nMr. and Mrs. Knight are truly an inspiration!\n\nLove truly does prevail. In fiction and in life.\n\nI cannot tell you how so proud of you I am. Proud of you for caring enough to research this sensitive topic; always being compassionate, taking the time to ask the right questions, worrying about timelines, accuracy, feelings, and the emotions. And oh boy did you ever kill the emotions part. I often felt like I was looking into my own life, experiencing Kadences turmoil while wanting so much to reach in and grab and comfort the incredible man that is Nix, the man who stood by like a rock waiting for his love to return.\n\nEven after having read it a few times now, I cant not think back to certain scenes without getting completely emotional and teary. Im in awe of your ability to take an embarrassing moment such as screaming in the bathroom and make me feel like that was okay, that it was just something that needed to be done, something than maybe others have done too.\n\nYou truly have a gift and I am so honored that I got to take this journey with you, as a beta reader as an information giver and best of all as a friend! I love you hard River and will never forget what you have given me.\n\nYou are a master at your craft and a beautifully caring person who puts so much care into her writing. I just cannot express how incredibly well written, powerful and breathtakingly beautiful this story truly is.\n\nWith Reclaimed youve just nailed it! Like holy wow! Looking at how Kadence and Nix have a love so strong they can conquer it all; even something that can be so detrimental to a marriage, having a family can be tough, things can change but thanks to youyou and your brilliant characters you showed us that things can also get better, people can come back, maybe even returning maybe a bit stronger.\n\nLady you amazed me, never did I think that something I deemed as ugly, something I always wanted to never ever admit to as having lived through would now make me feel like saying...\nHell yeah! I had post partum and I survived and Im a better for it! that maybe it was worth it.\n\nYou did that!\n\nYou made me feel it was a struggle worth embracing, worth admitting, worth talking about, maybe being something Im actually proud of overcoming. River you did that for me with this incredibly realistic, taboo of a little story that I will connect with on a deeper level for the rest of my being. I am bursting with excitement for the world to experience Reclaimed.\n\nSuch a perfect title for all which it stands forReclaiming love, Reclaiming self worth, Reclaiming happiness, Reclaiming familyReclaiming joy and finally Reclaiming yourself!\n\nOh and best of all Reclaiming SEX. River Savage style. Bust out the spare panties ladies of the book-loving world because you will need them!\n\nIm talking Nix, Im talking dirty, Im talking HEAVEN!\n\nHOLY Shnookerdookies! Does this little novella pack a sexual punch! Nothing beats a dry spell like a ton of hotter than hades beyond scoville scale sex Savage style. Nix and Kadence are sure to leave you gaping like a jealous voyeur at the insane sex scenes River has penned this time around. holy panty changes needed! Make up sex really is the best! And Nix and Kadence more than make of for the months they missed out!\n\nIn the end River all I can say again is thank you, for turning my dark and making it light!\n\nYour friend always,\nGilly xox'

2	"I kept reading hoping it would have a point to it all.  Reading this book reminded me of reading someone's Facebook page daily.  Glad that one is over."
3	'It was just ok. I might use it as a reference at some point, but too many things to look up separately. Just ok'
4	"Not finished with it yet but so far it's an easy and informative read I'm confident will produce great results.  In some ways it already has and I'm barely on chapter 2."
5	'I enjoyed this book and read the next one was soon as I finished this one.'
5	'Shane Michael Murray has created a world of orcs like I have never read before. There is magic, there is gore, and great descriptions of the struggles of a young orc. This is the 2nd book following "The Orc of Many Questions". It ties up some lose ends and introduces many new twists. I typically never read for more than an hour in a day but I read this whole book in 2. I can\'t wait for number 3 to come out.'
4	'Book kept me interested throughout.'
4	'**3.5 stars**\n\nThis was a pleasant surprise for me. About 1/2 of my friends hate this one and the other half love it and, honestly, I expected to be in the "hate" camp. Though the book started off a bit shakily for me, once it got going I found myself growing more and more fond of it. If I could describe this book in one word it would be "adorable". It has some flaws but it was a really sweet read.\n\nThis is a pretty realistic GFY story, if I do say so myself. Some of my friends hated Larry but I thought his crude humor and awkwardness were key to his character and were sort of endearing. I loved his fluid view of sexuality and his level of comfort with himself.\n\nThere is one scene that everyone talks about in their reviews for this book. I won\'t give it away (it totally surprised me). Though it is unsexy, it felt real- so I kind of loved it. Does that make me weird??\n\nAll in all, this book made we want to devour everything that James Fessenden has ever written. If this is his worst book, then I\'d love to see his good stuff. I have a feeling he could blow my mind.'

5	'very short book that can that can be read in 45-90 minutes BUT PACKED WITH INFORMATION.\n\nThis book ...\n\nDiscuses the three forms of cannabis Indica, Sativa, and Ruderalis.  he made one comment about Ruderalis "medical patients don\'t use Ruderalis to treat their conditions." I disagree with this COMPLETELY. Ruderalis has much lower THC and and MUCH HIGHER level of CBD than the other two. much more information on Ruderalis  in my closing comments.\n\nDifferent ways of consuming cannabis.\n\nDifferent cannabinoids in marijuana and conditions they help.\n\nHistory of Cannabis\n\nRecent and current medical studies. I just wish the book included hyper links so you could read the studies yourself\n\nMedical Marijuana treats you can make.\n\nclosing comments.  I rate this book 5 stars\n\nback to the Ruderalis comment earlier.  I am SICK AND TIRED OF RUDERALIS VARIETY OF CANNABIS BEING TREATED AS A RED HAIRED STEP CHILD!\n\nRuderalis, or Ruderalis/Indica hybrids are the PERFECT plants for MMJ patients to grow and here\'s why.\n\nFor their short height they produce a massive amount of buds. getting 30 grams of cured buds from 1 plant. there are some Ruderalis hybrids that produce that much or more.\n\nThese plants only grow 2-3 feet tall. you can grow them in a small space.\n\nthese Ruderalis  start blooming about 2-3 weeks after seedling stage\n\nthese bloom automatically. this gives you the following benefits.\n\na. These are ready to harvest 55-70 days after the shoot pops out of the ground.\n\nb. You can have your seedlings, vegetative growth,  AND FLOWERING plants all in the same room. set your lights to 16 hours on and 8 off. set it once and forget item\n\nc. since these are small plants you only need to use 1/3-1/2 of the the nutrients. in "Growing Autoflowers " Justin Griswell recommended using only 1/4th of the recommended  nutrients.\n\nd. You can use smaller pots. 11 liter (3 gallon)  pots are all you need.\n\ne. Use much less water\n\nf. need less soil.\n\ng. A lot of people diss Autoflowers because of lower THC % many autoflowers strains have THC as high as 15-18%. this is because about 80-85% of the genetics of the photo period with 15-20% Ruderalis  genetics\n\nh. with the very short life cycle 55-70 days you can grow two crops in half the space and half the time photoperiod plants need along with half the number of grow rooms, and lights.\n\nit is HIGH TIME these Autoflowering strains get the respect they justly deserve.\n\nI am a medical Marijuana patient for Crohns disease. this works 100 times better than all of the pharmaceutical preparations I had to take. with the best pharmaceutical preparation I was only able to go 7-10 days between flares.  Much of the medication I couldn\'t afford.\n\nWithout MMJ Crohns was HELL ON EARTH.\n\nWith MMJ Crohns is only a minor inconvenience.\n\nThe chronic pain GONE\n\nThe gout like inflammation  GONE\n\nThe fatigue and no energy GONE.\n\nBeen out of Depends (adult diapers for almost 4 years\n\nFlatulence 95% gone.\n\nUncontrollable diarrhea 95-98% gone. I now go 4-6 months between very mild inconsequential flares.\n\nIsrael had a study with 22 Crohns patients used Marijuana to treat their condition.  all got relief from cannabis but about half of the patients went into remission.\n\nI like to say "Medical Marijuana  GAVE ME MY LIFE BACK!"\n\nif I get to November 11, 2017; I will only have had two very mild flares in the last year!'

5	"Oh, my!  This book was good!!!  There is a kidnapper on the loose in Florida and the press has taken to calling him The Snatcher.  He takes his fifth victim from Palm Dale.  Jenny Dawson is snatched right in front of her school, just minutes before her mother pulls up.  Sergeant Miriam Castillo and her partner, rookie Deputy Joseph Lang, pull over an old blue station wagon for a broken tail light a short time later.  And the large, blonde, older woman with too much make up shoots and kills Lang when he approaches the car.  Miriam pursues the wagon but finds it parked beside the road empty.  It was a stolen car, as described by the janitor who had seen it right before Mrs Dawson arrived to pick up her daughter.  Now that is a beginning that gets your attention.  And it doesn't let up.\n\nNow I'll tell you the bad part.  It ends in a cliff hanger.  And I hate cliff hangers!  But this story was so good, I didn't even care.  I just got the next book and kept reading.\n\nIf you want some excitement in your life, read this book.  You won't be sorry."

3	"This book started off bomb, but then seem to fall flat in my opinion. I was hoping something else was revealed and caught my attention, but it played out as I thought. I love the storyline, but unsure if I'll read part 2."
1	'I read about 40 pages of this "work" and decided to put it down for good. It\'s now gone from my house. From what I could stand to read, it\'s basically a soap opera or trash novel. A friend once said he was reading a book he hated but he continued to read. Asked why he continued, he replied, "Because I started it\'. Unlike him, I don\'t like to waste my time on non-productive or un-enjoyable activities. If this is the new standard for sophisticated literature, we are lost. I did not have the option of no stars.'
5	"Once Perfect (Shattered Past) by Cecy Robson\n** I received a copy of this book from NetGalley in exchange for my honest review. **\nSo glad I had the opportunity to read Once Perfect.  Mateo stole my heart from the very start.  Evelyn came across as sweet and vulnerable yet she has this inner strength that came through when needed. This is the first I have read by Cecy Robson but I guarantee it won't be the last.  I look forward to reading Ms. Robson's next book in the (Shattered Past) series. Even though there were some heavy issues dealt with throughout this story, I felt, at it's heart, it was a very sweet, loving read with a HEA ending.  I throughly enjoyed Once Perfect an devoured it in one sitting!"
5	"Another great book from Daryl Moore.  This book swoops you up with its story line, you become engaged with Sandra and the other characters.  It's a realistic tale of men and women in the workplace, competing for a promotion.  I'm still not sure how I felt about the ending and what Sandra had to do to stay ahead of her male counterpart but it was definitely a surprise and very believable.  It's a short read and definitely worth the time."
5	'Great length. I enjoyed the way the author developed the characters and tied all of them together. This author writes great books.'
5	'just back from a week in Virginia visiting our daughter. What a great introduction to a city we knew nothing about'
3	"The book begins like a typical teenage romance with Ronnie and her friends having a crush on the older, and mysterious, Drake.  Things seem normal until the animals in the neighborhood begin disappearing.  The girls find one of the missing cats in a pet shop and the owner said that Drake brought him in.\n\n  Soon one of the girls, Jasmine, is found in Drake's yard unconscious.  When she wakes up in the hospital she doesn't recognize anyone.  Ronnie and Katie decide to find out what happened to Jasmine at Drake's house.  The only problem is they have to stay away from Drake's evil cousins.\n\n  The girls aren't able to solve the mystery and soon Ronnie's brother and his best friend are missing.  Will they ever see him again?\n\n  I thought the basis for this story was interesting.  The girls seem like typical teenagers laughing, being silly, and crushing on boys.  I could tell that they care about one another and want to keep each other safe.\n\n  I also liked how mysterious Drake and his family were.  The girls begin to think he is a vampire but Drake lets them know that isn't the case.  Throughout the book we're never quite sure what the family is and we never find out.  It's mysterious but it works with this story.\n\n  The one thing I didn't like about the book was the lack of emotions from the characters.  When Ronnie's brother goes missing she simply goes to bed.  There are several times when the author makes reference to her mother's eyes being red but Ronnie keeps on going to netball practice, hanging out with her friends, and never once seems upset that he is missing.  It was very unrealistic to me.\n\n  I enjoyed the book and thought it was an easy read but that it needed a little more depth and explanation as to what exactly was going on in the Demonto house.\n\nI give this book 3 out of 5 stars."
5	'Interesting read and many a good piece of advice to follow.'
5	"The romance just keeps getting better, this series is wonderful. It has mystery, love, adventure dominance, hot sex, etc... this series is so worth the time to read. Once you start, you can't put it down. Thank you Sharon Cummin. I am eagerly awaiting the next!"
5	"I expected a steamy racy story about an exclusive private men's club. Instead I read a well written complex story that had me guessing and finding unexpected twists with every page.  Congratulations to the authors for delivering so much more than was expected and a great read. Enjoy reading."
4	'This author is one of my favorite Christian writers and I love how she weaves faith into the storyline without it overtaking the story.  I am not giving it 5 stars due to a possible cliff hanger.  Not sure how the second book with start out or if she even meant for the ending to indicate a cliff hanger but will continue to read the series as it is a good one. Kate and Jed have known each other for years and are both smoke jumpers.  They have a history that goes back to when Jed showed up at her house when he was 17 wanting to be on her fathers smoke jumping team.  Now Jed his the supervisor of the team and Kate has come home to help train the new recruits and jump her self.  Not wanting to do a spoiler I will not give any other facts of the storyline away but will say many issues will come up between them and their decision to be friends or more.  This is an interesting storyline and the author gives us a view of the dangers of smoke jumpers and what that entails.  This is a good book that has some suspense, faith, and romance.  Highly recommend it.'
5	"I didn't expect any less from another book from one of my favorite authors. I was surely not disappointed. I love the fact as with all of these books someone from a previous book gets mentioned. It's always about love and a little, ok maybe a lot of obsession. I'd give you more but I'm not going to spoil this for anyone.  Just read it!!!!"
1	"How could anyone read this book and not be disgusted by the fact that both the male and female protagonists are under the age of 18? Almost 18 doesn't cut it with me. These are mentally, physically, and sexually abused children being written about here who are being further exploited by each other. I'm no prude, I expected this book to be dark and raw I just didn't expect it to be about children and that made it unreadable in my opinion. It would have been easy enough to make them full adults by telling their backstory in the past. Why would I a thirty something year old woman want to read about a deviant sexual relationship between two teenagers? And a better question, why would the author write something so vile and gross with no warning to the public that this involves minors - sick."
5	'Great books'
1	'Katie and Scott are the ho-hum "protagonists" of this easily forgettable book. Katie, although beautiful, leads a very dull life. Uh-huh? Scott, despite being "the most beautiful man she had ever seen" (yawn...aren\'t they all anymore?) is single at 26 and looking for Ms. Right. The "cute meet" starts with him racing his truck/SUV passed her on a snowy road and drives her into a ditch. She later meets him somewhere and then recognizes the car, gets all "huffy," and that\'s suppose to be the spark/tension that makes Scott realize "this one\'s different than all the other girls." Bored yet? Exactly. The book is about as interesting as watching grass grow and horribly predictable. The only other thing that happens in the first half of the book is the two of them go on a sleigh-ride date (awwwww) and then Scottie taking her into the woods to cut down a "real xmas tree." (awwwww) Somehow, while setting up the tree everything gets hot and heavy and they have 30 pages of pornographic sex under the (blushing?) tree. Then an evil woman at work tries to break them up, and it works for about 30 pages, until Katie\'s BFF (who only appears to move the plot forward, and has no other purpose in the book nor dimensionality) tells her what the *itch did, and everything is resolved in short, predictable, (painfully obvious) order. This book is awful, except for the sex scenes if you like X-rated, which I don\'t. It can be read in 30 minutes by skimming one page, skipping three, skimming one, skipping three. You\'ll miss nada that you couldn\'t fill in yourself. Terrible.\nRec it? Now way\nBuy it? Never\nReread it? Not if I were stranded on an island and this were the only book available.\nSorry.'
5	"This is a great book. I always wondered what Alpha's back story was and now i feel sad for him. I always thought he was an evil traitor but now I think he actually has a reason for acting like that."
1	"I couldn't even finish this book. My dislike started from the first page, when the author talked about her extra finger and birthmark on her neck. The story from then on was ok, until I got to the part where her brother George slipped his tongue in her mouth and she was filled with uncontrollable desires for him. I couldn't take any more after that. There are way better books out there, and I have read most of them."
4	"4.5 stars\n\nRiece and Mason were together years ago before Riece left without any reason. Now, Riece has taken as assignment in Black Hills as a US Forestry Service photographer and Mason, as Park Ranger, volunteers to be his guide. But when their hiking takes them deep into the forest and into a trap, their leisure time together turns into something so much sinister when they find themselves being hunted by a group of people hellbent on making the chase all the more exciting. Will Mason and Riece be able to get themselves out of danger even though they're vastly out numbered?\n\nWow! This novella was something else! I was expecting a little suspense, maybe some action but what I got instead of a suspenseful thriller about two guys forced into the role of prey and running for their life, trying to survive being hunted. I loved that there was so much history behind Mason and Riece but that Mason didn't let that get in the way of wanting to pick things back up. It was obvious how much Mason adored Riece and his quirks and how Riece still was in love with Mason. I really enjoyed them together and how much trust and faith they had in each other.\n\nMy only issue was that it started off with too much sex for me. I wasn't sure if Id like the story because of that but around 25% things really started to pick up. I got sucked into the story and just couldn't put it down!\n\nAll in all, this was a phenomenal story in the Circles series. Im glad we got Masons story and it turned out to be such a suspenseful, captivating read. But now I want Tylers story! And I hope this won't be the last we see of Mason and Riece. If youve read the Circles series then youll definitely enjoy this one!"
5	'This was my first book to read in the sweetblood series.  I liked it.  Andre and Juliette were irresistible.  I love vampires.  I loved their romance.  I am ready to continue ready the rest of the series.  I feel each one will get better and better.\nCopy gifted in exchange for an honest review.'
1	'Plot is terrible, poorly written.  With a very odd style of writing.  I would not recommend to anyone.'
5	'Good read'
5	"Really enjoyed it kinda wish the ending was different but over all the novel was really good. I can't wait for more"
4	'Love the being able to play Solitaire anytime, anywhere. With the Kindle you always have something to keep your mind active.'
4	'Complimentary copy provided by author/publisher for an honest review.\n\nThis was a difficult book for me to read at times because of the references to the Scottish language. However, I thoroughly enjoyed the story. Kristin definitely has a way of drawing in her readers with her words and the descriptions of her characters. Of course, I loved Colin\'s character since I enjoyed seeing her writing him into different situations and the "disguises" that he used in order to complete his mission.\n\nAnd Arwynn was such a strong and brave lead character. Those are my favorite female characters to read about and Kristin seems to describe her perfectly.\n\nI have not picked up a book of Kristin\'s that I have not enjoyed and this one was no different.'
5	'This was a fantastic book, great original ideas, and interesting characters, fast paced.\nOnce I started reading this story it was hard to put it down'
5	"I love these books. They are very interesting and the characters grow on you. I'll read all of this author's books."
5	'Best book to have on your phone. Quite easy to use with the Kindle app.'
5	'Eight totally delightful "cozy mystery" short stories! (Well, actually, one is more a romance.) by 6 well-known authors make this book a winner for cuddling up with a cozy blanket and maybe a glass of warm, mulled wine or cider on the cold and nasty winter nights ahead. Each author does a fairly good job developing the characters as the story line itself is developing. This means you get characters you can care about, and a story that keeps you reading, in the short-story format. Now THAT is what I call a "winning combination"! Bet you will too.'
5	'Wow. What to say about this novel.\n\nIt\'s...intense. I highly doubt people will have a "neutral" reaction to this book.\n\nPersonally, I loved it. It felt real on a deep level, even if that reality was in part symbolic. It also totally resonated with relationships I had in my own high school years, in particular with a very close friend who struggled with a lot of the same issues, in terms of feeling forever out of step with the world, and needing an intensity of feeling and connection with others to counteract that in some way, or maybe just to bear it. Flirting with the dark but loving and being drawn to the light was a component in our relationship, as well.\n\nI don\'t want to say too much about the plot itself, because 1) I don\'t want to spoil it, and 2) more than anything, it served for me as a psychological journey and deconstruction. Primarily among the latter, it was like witnessing the systematic removal of all of the social "niceties" to reveal a kernel of raw truth underneath.\n\nOr, it was a highly skilled exercise in brainwashing by an incredibly brilliant and manipulative sociopath...you decide.\n\nOf course, I\'m somewhat biased because I absolutely love this writer, and pretty much love everything of hers that I read. She captures spaces with her words like no other writer I know, and makes her characters so real I feel almost like I know them. Moreover, she has that gift of making sympathetic those situations and people who, on their face, might seem like they shouldn\'t be...which is a particular weakness of mine anyway.\n\nNot for the faint of heart, however...or for those who like their morality in neat, succinct, black and white boxes where some things are always "good" and some people are always "bad" regardless of their life situations and the depth of feeling inside their hearts.'
5	'Love Jane Feather, love this!'
5	"This was a  great book!  It really opened my eyes as to how I should present myself in some social situations.  I tend to become very nervous and therefore become a chatterbox...not in a good way.  This can be a huge problem because I sometimes hear myself talking and think, geez, is that me?  One of the wonderful things I love about this book is that it stresses to observe a situation, remain calm which allows myself to see how the conversation is going to go and jump in rather than coming off domineering. The book also taught me to observe others then I could make the decision of whether or not I bring them into my circle on a more personal level. I certainly appreciate the candidness of the author to warn people of being boastful, whether by mistake or not.  I have a sister who is braggish and it turns people away almost instantly, including family members, however humor is definitely the way to go if you can pull it off and have a bright personality.  I think I agree with the author that most anyone can do this is you relax and just have fun, and most importantly, be yourself.  I will actually have my teen read this book! It could be quite helpful since he struggles with self esteem issues and has difficulty in social situations.  The do's and don't list could be a great asset!"
5	'I really enjoy Elmo books. This one did not disappoint. Being a ministers wife I can totally relate to the stories.'
5	"I am so glad, the alternate ending wasn't used. Curious to see Drakes turnabout.\nThis book was bittersweet to me, gah the journaling from rehab reminds me of my own. Your words personifying heroin is right on. I had to put it down for a bit, her struggles were once my own.\nSuch tragedy for this family, what's scary is this fiction is parallel to many of our lives, and you wrote this well.\nTissues needed here, I am a tough one to cry I believe this book is the 4th novel out of thousands that evoked such emotions from me. A must read 5+ heartbreaking stars!"
4	'I loved this book because it typified the life of the Australian outback so well. The tough, rough landscape that breeds tough men women and children who despite the adversity they face still manage to survive and continue on re writing their stories as their lives are changed and moulded by the landscape. The personalities and warmth of each of the characters drew me in as the story unfolded. W e all know the Max,s, people so scarred by life that their only solace is to be one with nature. They live alone but have found peace in their own way. The life of dedicated doctors in the outback is far from easy and the author depicted the struggles of the people so well. I would recommend this book to anyone who has a love of the Australian outback and the characters that are created from it. I gave this book a four star rating because I enjoyed it.'
1	"I ordered the wrong item and I'm trying to find out how to get a refund. I don't have a Kindle. I thought it got delivered my home"
1	'The most boring read ever.'
2	'I am a huge fan of V.R. Marks but I found this book very hard to get through.  The plot was too predictable and I found the characters somewhat boring.  I would say this is my least favorite book from this author.  Hindsight being 20/20 I wish I had waited to buy this until more reviews were in to see what others thought of it.'
5	"I know I won't be able to say enough good things about this book but I will try.  I was enthralled from beginning to end and have not been able to pick up another book since reading The Collar of Freedom.  It's a fascinating story of a woman who thought she had a decent life with her husband even if he didn't pay as much attention to her as she would have liked, a decent job and the mother to 2 boys.  Until one day her new boss shows up at work and not just turns her world upside down but throws it all around until she's so mixed up she can't figure out what she wants.  Things happen that kind of give her a push in the right direction...directly into her boss's arms and nothing will ever be the same.\nI absolutely loved everything about this book and am excitedly awaiting for book 2.  The characters were very in depth and nothing was left out other than the few unanswered questions that will be resolved in book 2.  Alexander is probably one of the best male alpha characters that I've read in quite a long time.  You really get to see and understand what is going on in his head.  I'd definitely recommend that you do not pass up the chance to read this book, you will not be disappointed.  18+ only though."
4	'Nice sound from this little speaker'
5	"I bought this book recently for my god child and a friend's grand daughter.  It is a very nice story and the art is very original and engaging.  Thank you Anna for such a wonderful tale and meaningful message."
5	'I really enjoyed this story. The details had the ring of authenticity that comes from someone who was there. Carefully crafted, the story follows a marine from his initial flight into Viet Nam through his introduction to combat to his loss of sensitivity to the events around him.'
5	'I went through so many emotions reading this story. I felt for Melanie, hated her and so many more emotions in between. I have never read anything like this before and I really enjoyed it.'

5	'Quick, entertaining and thought provoking. Should be required reading for any business owner or marketer!'
5	'Having faith is hard at times, this book explains what having faith means. And how having faith works, having more faith or any at all. Can be learned from reading and understanding what is expected from you, good book I loved it and learned a lot from it.  Jeff Wilkerson'

4	"Whisper To me is the third book in Christina Lees Breathless series.  It is unlike the other books in the series and a bit more emotional.  I was surprised by the characters in this book.  There is a lot more depth to them and it left me feeling more than I expected.  This story was beautiful, memorizing,sexy,and intense.  Christina has written another marvelous and perfect book.\n\nThis is Rachel and Kais story.  We meet Rachel in the previous books and she as portrayed as the fast,slutty party girl.  She is fun and a loyal friend.  Rachel returns home over her Summer break. where she finds her best friend and her brother Kai.  She also finds her past has returned as well  Kai has returned back home to work in his families casino.  He was living in Amsterdam where he got into a bit of trouble.  Kai and Rachel were very close three years prior. Rachel was involved in a pretty bad motorcycle accident with her ex and troublesome past.  Kai helped her recover physically and emotionally after her ex abandoned her.  When she left for college she became a different person never wanting to experience the pain she went through.  While Kai helped Rachel recover he started having romantic feelings for her.  He never acted on them and never planned too.  As they begin to spend more time together Kais  feelings for Rachel become even stronger.  Deep down Kai knows his feelings aren't mutual or are they?  Rachel is used to using guys to fill a void, but Kai isn't other guys.  He truly cares for her. Will they be able to admit their feelings for one another?  Or will the end of Summer lead them in separate directions once again?\n\nRachel and Kais relationship is one of a kind.  He knows and understand her.  Its a very beautiful union.  Both have changed in the past three years, but their love and friendship remained strong and true.  I loved watching their growth over the course of the book.  It was rare and unique and made me fall in love with them while they were falling in love with each other.\n\nI enjoyed seeing a different side of Rachel in this book.  Her strength and perseverance shined through every page.  These books are not to be missed. Each book can also be read as a stand alone which is great too.  I look forward to seeing this series continue.  If you are looking for a unique and heartfelt story then this may just be the book for you."
5	'This book kept me entertained fulllllly. I read this in a day. You have to read this book.\nJax is such a great guy. Emerson is one of the most interesting characters but I love her after the first chapter. Her name rocks too!\n\nReadddd it!!!'

4	'Good ole Ben Franklin was a icon for America in many ways.  Not only was he an accomplished writer, he was at the forefront of political intrigue during America\'s formative years, an inventor, a heralded scientist (even in Europe), and even, for a short time, a colonel in a pre-revolutionary war militia.  All this is documented in his autobiography.  The presentation is a bit haphazard since he relates experiences not necessarily in chronological order which makes the narrative a bit choppy.  And his choice of words was sometimes hard to understand since some expressions used in the 1760\'s are not used today.  Nevertheless, I found some of his discussion particularly about the problems the colonists had with Britain in gaining any kind of respect has considerable relevance today.  For example, the colonists were forbidden to form an army for their own defense during the French-Indian war since that was considered in Britain leading to insurrection.  So, Britain sent their own troops which were to be supported by taxes imposed on the colonists with exception to British proprietary holding (i.e. landowners in Britain of property in the colonies).  Thus, the relatively poor were being taxed while the wealthy were not.  Sound familiar?  The British troops were often brutal to the colonists--seizing goods and property from colonists without compensation to the owners.  Sound familiar?  And then those same troops often met with disaster in battles with the French and Indians due to their inexperience with "gorilla warfare" and overconfidence in their leadership.  Sound familiar?  Franklin\'s discussion of these and other events in his life and the lives of his acquaintances are still issues that prevail today.  I recommend anyone interested in a first hand narrative of life in America\'s formative years read this.'

5	'enjoyed this book, more from Alexa Steele please'
5	"Wonderful storytelling. A real page turner as they say.\n\nThe author's Once We Were Brothers was by far\none of the best books I ever read. Got all my friends and their husbands to read it."
5	"I received an arc in exchange for a fair review.\nI love this series, and The Paramedic's choice did not disappoint. The characters are well developed and the plot keeps your interest.  I couldn't put the book down once I started reading it. If you like paranormal, then you will love this series."
4	'This story just caught me right from the start! I loved the way the author portrayed Joe - the way a 12 year old boy speaks, feels, acts and reacts - I could "picture" him.... Even though I knew - at one certain point, half way into the book - who the serial killer was, it certainly didn\'t detract from the story itself - It was actually very cleverly revealed  - The plot was original and well written...The one thing I found lacking was more "romance" between Angela and Roman....There could have been more "courtship" from Roman....Okay - I know he was tracking a serial killer and trying to keep Joe and Angela alive at the same time - but I felt like Angela deserved more than he gave her, considering all those years of living where she was barely making ends meet with two kids to raise....This book will keep you reading right till the end!!!'
4	"I love Marietta Montana!!!\nWhat a Bride wants is written by Kelly Hunter. She was a new author for me but I am so glad I've discovered her! I adored her writing!! There really wasn't anything I didn't enjoy about this book with the exception, I wish it were longer. :)\nGreat read!!!!!"

5	"I finished this book a few weeks ago and I am still thinking about Yvonne's characters and her beautiful writing. Admittedly it's taken so long to pull together my thoughts because this book left me speechless. Sometimes books just beg to be absorbed ... and if you've ever had a book hit you like Secondhand Hearts has hit me, you'd absolutely agree.\n\nI'm not the kind of reviewer who will tell you what happened or how Kessler and Tavyn are two pained, broken souls. Or how their guilt is completely crippling and how they lost faith in love. Because you could read any of the reviews and gather that much. But this book made me feel things I haven't felt in a LONG TIME while reading. Yvonne writing and storytelling ability is beautiful ... remarkable, even. This book is a hidden gem in the indie community and more people need to get this in their hands on it.\n\nIf you love angst and emotion and that gut-wrenching read ... you need this book in your life. This story is powerful. Yvonne skillfully ripped my heart from my chest and slowly, over the course of several hundred pages, made me whole again. This book is four and a half phenomenal stars and I will absolutely be one-clicking anything else Yvonne writes. I'm a fan for life ... and if you read this, you'll be one, too."
3	"This was an okay story.  Not the best story of the highlands I've ever read and certainly not the worse.  Can't quite state why I felt unsatisfied at the end of the story, except for the story involved with the step-mother.  As for the mystery of the step mother's murder, not enough clues were woven into the story to make it part of the story!  All in all, it was ok to spend a rainy afternoon reading this instead of watching football!"

4	'Short and sweet, this little book is a great reminder of what it takes to be successful in life. Although the book is based on life lessons from successful people, there is also a lot of social psychology which underlies his thoughts.'
5	'By far one of my favorite books. I highly recommend this to any healthcare professional  Paul, the author, was so real and authentic, you felt like you knew him. I laughed and cried with the book.'
5	"Another awesome book by G.A. Aiken. The only down side is that I have to wait so long for the next one. But after reading this one, I think I'm going to go back and reread the previous books. I can always use a laugh. And these books always have me laughing out loud. Thanks again, Ms. Aiken, for such a wonderful read."

Her Mom lives there but they are not close.  Her high school sweetheart has returned to town also, with his 15 year old son. Things are tense but how their lives start to change and grow makes a most definite good read!\nWould I recommend this book to a friend?  Yes, all three of them!"

Book 1 (Hate) ended with Cutter and Paige completely separated.  Cutter has gone back to school and left Paige to heal from her injuries.\n\nBook 2 picks up two years later.  Paige has been undergoing intensive physical therapy to help her learn to walk again.  She has also been attending a community college close to home, however, her dream of getting back on a horse has been shattered.  The doctor has advised in no uncertain terms that horses are not in Paiges future.  Paige decides to return to college, but with her injury is unable to live at the sorority house.  There are too many stairs which will make living there impossible.  Her parents buy her a house behind Greek Row and she and Millie move in together.\n\nUpon her return to school Paige receives an email from Cutter asking her why she has returned.  Paige ignores him and tries to carry on with life as normal.  However, at every opportunity it seems Cutter is thrust into her face.  He is now dating Laney Bitch Face Davis and it appears as though his life has just continued as normal.  This completely devastates Paige, but she puts on a brave face and pretends as though she is alright with it.\n\nMillie and Paige attend a frat party one night and Paige meets Holden.  He is gorgeous, caring, compassionate and smart to boot.  They end up really hitting it off and soon start spending time together.  Holden is also studying physical therapy, and encourages Paige to make use of the facilities at the University  specifically the pool in order to strengthen her core and her back.  They start spending a lot of time together and although the relationship is still new, it is clear Holden is very interested in her.  He soon realizes that the ghosts from her past relationship are still ruling her and that she isn't over Cutter and tells her that for now they should work on just being friends.\n\nJust know that Ill be waiting Paige, the minute your heart is available.  Ill be waiting  Holden, Love and Hate (Book #2 Love) J.J. Dorn\n\nPaige although upset understands this because she isn't over Cutter, and is still dealing with his betrayal.  Cutter confirms to Paige that he and Laney have broken up, but a night at one of the frat parties sends Paige reeling.  She walks into the room Cutter shares with Tanner and discovers Cutter and Laney being intimate.  Cutter tries to go after her, but again, Paige feels like he has lied and betrayed her.\n\nPlease Cutter, I cant survive you twice.  It feels like my words are just a whisper but I know he hears them because I watch the pain dart across his eyes.  Love and Hate (Book # 2 Love) J.J. Dorn.\n\nWith Halloween fast approaching Paige and Millie decide to let it really all hang out, figuratively and end up going to the Halloween Party/ Paiges 21st birthday party in outfits that leave very little to the imagination.  Paige ends up having too much to drink and ends up being rescued by Cutter and taken home.  Cutter takes care of Paige and makes sure she is cleaned up and put to bed.  Cutter tells Paige that he would like to work on their friendship and that he wants her to drive home with him the next day.  Paige argues with him and tells him that if he wants to ride together, he should ride with her.  He quickly agrees and the next day they set off for home.\n\nAlthough initially awkward the ride home isn't as bad as Paige imagined it would be.  She is also introduced for the first time to Cutters mom.  This is not the disastrous meeting she imagined it would be  and Cutter soothes her by telling her that his mother is now sober and realises that his fathers death was never her fault.  This eases some of the guilt that Paige has weighing on her soul.\n\nPaige is home alone for this break and Cutter takes it upon himself to ensure that she is safe and looked after.  This of course raises a litany of emotions and brings up all the old feelings  especially when Paige sees him in her room.  They reconnect, however, Paige keeps reminding herself that this is still the same man that betrayed and destroyed her.\n\nThis time when visiting at home Lacey encourages Paige to get back on her childhood horse, The Biz, and although initially terrified, Paige gets back on the horse.  She spends her time getting stronger in the saddle under Laceys guidance.  This is definitely balm for her soul as well as her body.\n\nDuring the day Paige is with the animals she loves and the nights are consumed with Cutter.\n\nThe course of true love never did run smooth though and there is a development that Paige is too nervous to tell Cutter about. When she eventually does work up the courage to tell Cutter, she is accosted by Laney Davis and things spiral out of control.  She is helped by the last person she expected, Cooper Daniels (Cutters brother).\n\nAfter another tragedy occurs and she refuses to see Cutter, Cooper visits her and begs for her to see Cutter.\n\nIm begging you Paige, please see him, Cooper pleads.  Im sorry, I cant help you.  I stare past him out my giant window.  Cooper sighs and I hear him exit my room.  Im sorry Cutter.  I just cant save you and myself  Love and Hate (Book #2 Love) J.J. Dorn\n\nWill this be the end of Cutter and Paige?  Has too much happened over the course of their relationship for them to ever recover what they have lost and move forward.\n\nI have been waiting in anticipation of the release of this book.  Book 1 ended on somewhat of a cliff hanger, and we weren't sure of what would become of Cutter and Paige.  We also knew Cutter had pretty much cut Paige out of his life and couldn't be around her.\nThis book is full of angst, emotion and heartbreak.  We finally discover what happened that led Cutter away.  We also discover the hell that he has been dealing with on his own.  Although he appears to have moved on, it is clear that he still deeply loves Paige and has been unable to move forward from their relationship.  Their pain is palpable, for anyone that has ever loved and lost, this book will certainly strike up the chords of that heartache and remind you of how you felt.\n\nI loved the references to all the music.  Especially when Paige is experiencing the breakup and then when she gets angry and starts listening to the really angry music.  This made me laugh, because as any young woman will tell you  this is exactly how we experience our breakups.  Crying into our ice cream at first and then getting really mad and cursing all men.\n\nI also loved how both main characters were both so fractured and broken.  Although they were strong  they were definitely in pain and in need of each other to soothe the pain and heartache.  There were times when I wondered if these two were ever going to get their acts together and be brutally honest with one another.\n\nI loved how much of a fighter Paige is.  Although, she is from an elite family, her life had never been easy.  She was mercilessly teased as a child by her class mates and as an adult she had endured more than most would ever have to.  She came out a survivor and not only that she went on to do what she was told she never would.  Too often these days, we read books with heroines that are weak and that will never stand on their own two feet.  Paige is not this girl  she is broken yes, but she is most definitely tough and a fighter.\n\nI am giving this book 4.5 stars.  J.J. Dorn is quickly becoming one of my favourite authors and I cannot wait to see what she has in store for us next."

5	"I loved this book. Very well written, and has a sweet Christian theme to it- but still very riveting. The author doesn't include raunchy scenes, but it is  a book of a man turning his life around for the better, but still not thinking he's good enough for the girl since his past is sordid. I can't wait to read the next in the series."

4	'Transformed by Tough Times by Steve Reed focuses on the benefits of suffering in a very thorough way, exploring scripture, and taking us step-by-step in 209 pages how and why we suffer.\n\nWhile it\'s not quite as exhaustive as Randy Alcorn\'s If God is Good, Steve Reed quite satisfactorily in a warm and friendly voice encourages us to look at suffering in a different light. He uses scripture to help us understand in layman\'s terms that pain is a benefit.\n\nHe begins the book with a lengthy football story from his past which I felt went on a bit too long. I would have rather seen it get right into the meat of his purpose. Examples people can relate to and touching missionary stories that Reed personally experienced pepper the chapters. Reed also makes the Biblical figures more understandable by paraphrasing a lot of what we read in the Bible. I didn\'t have time to check the accuracy of it, but much of it was familiar and I have no reason to doubt its accuracy.\n\nOn page 16, Reed jumps from a paraphrased biblical story of Paul in jail to a personal story. This caused me to break from being immersed in the book. He did separate it with dotted lines to show a scene break, but it felt rough all the same. Otherwise, the book has zero apparent errors and is well-organized. Reed uses a style of writing similar to what I assume would be his preaching style. A lot of his writing feels as if he is standing in front of me behind a pulpit--it\'s warm, caring, and sounds like a speech not a book. The writing style is casual with humor interspersed in it and stomach-groaning puns.\n\nOn page 61, Reed acknowledges that 80% of his suffering was probably his own fault,"Admitting my own sin and stupidity is not particularly noble; it\'s just a matter of dealing with life responsibly." 80% is a good number for the rest of us, too. He encourages us to persevere through tough times whether we caused it or someone else\'s sin caused it in our lives. Reed identifies how people think of God and suffering. Reed also gets into physical suffering and debunks the health and wealth gospel. His style of writing is a teaching style with great transitions between chapters. Good teaching styles make learning something easier on the reader. The most touching part of the book were his stories of his mom\'s fight with Lyme Disease.\n\n"Mom told me how some of her toughest times came through many dark and lonely nights when the pain kept her from sleeping. When she felt that she didn\'t even have the mental energy to pray, she turned on her inspirational music or homemade tape recordings. Often she\'d pray, `Lord, I can\'t even think straight to pray, so let this tape express my prayer to You.\'" (Page 125).\n\nReed uses his mom\'s struggle to show how our pain is not wasted. His mom hated going to therapy because of the rude people in her group, but she had no choice. Instead, she prayed for God to help her love them. One tough guy might have become saved because she took the time to look past her own irritation to love another. That scene made me tear up.\n\nOverall, Reed\'s style of writing and encouragement made this book worth four stars. It\'s one I would urge someone to read who is new to the faith, suffering, and needing to find the path to walk through the pain. It\'s a simple explanation that suffering is a benefit, not a detriment. It doesn\'t seek to resolve a person\'s pain, but to comfort them and help them see the joy in their suffering through the eyes of various biblical characters.\n\n*Book given by CSS Speaker Services to review.'
4	"I love when I read the final part of a series and everything just comes together. Things were explained, things that I didn't see coming at all. And not just one thing, there were several! I thought I had it all figured out at the end of part 3, but I was wrong. Ella managed to shock me with some of these revelations!\n\nLucas and Leah haven't had an easy past. Lucas especially. Getting to really see everything Lucas went through was heartbreaking. Going into the past isn't easy for Lucas. It almost breaks him. But Leah deserves that closure. She deserves to know what happened to him, to her, and the part he played in it all.\n\nI hurt for Lucas. I love what he said about his past with Mother, how it must have been fate. At first that seems like a messed up thing to say, until he explained it. Then I felt all swoony.\n\nIve enjoyed this twisted fairy tale series. Sexy and dark with a damaged man. Just my type of read. Overall, I enjoyed this final installment. I do with the ending would have given us a little more closure, but I was still happy with how things were wrapped up. 4 stars for part four, and 4 stars for the serial overall!"
4	"Well written erotica but I won't finish the serial since I prefer complete stories. I can get a sample of the writing by looking at the Amazon preview page so that argument doesn't fly.\n\nPossible spoilers:\n\nWouldn't it be easier to hire a call girl to entertain clients than employ a woman as an office worker / sex worker? So many lines are crossed and I don't see how you could fall in love with a woman who agreed to such an arrangement."
5	"Wow this is just. I am speechless. If I had to sum it up in one\nword it was transcendent. But of course that is not me. Only\n one word only from me? Not a chance. This has to be the\nabsolute best ending for a book I have ever read. Im happy\nwith the ending but sorry to say goodbye to Alex Quinn and\nall the other wonderful characters I have come to love along\nthe way. If you have not read book one stop reading my\nreview now!!!! You know where we left off with Quinn a mess\n and Alex trying to help her decide what to do. Well get the\ntissues read before you open the book. When Queen gets\na call from Jordan she bolts from her apartment to get to him.\n And you will need those tissues throughout this book but it is\n well worth it. The wedding is postponed but not off. There is\n no way Quinns evil, vial , and all around ass of a father is\nwill make sure he gets what he wants. The heartless man\nthins he is to smart to get caught. But there is one thing he\n did not plan on/ Quinn has friends who love her. And not one\n but two men that won't let (arrgh father is too good a word\nfor him) her father hurt her. Then there is how much Quinn\nhas grown through these books. But you will not believe who\n puts Quinn in her place when she is about too loose the one\n thing she needs more that anything. And before you ask it is\n not Alex, but I am not telling you will have to read the\nbook to find out.\n\nNow before I ruin this for you I will leave off here.  I hope you\n enjoy this book as much as I did. If you do like this book,\nplease consider leaving a review. The Authors really like it\nwhen you do; they value your opinions too."
5	'I really enjoyed this novel with interesting characters who were trying to live with their disappointments. They then have new situations to keep you guessing about what happens next. Waiting to read more.'
5	'This next installment of the Immortal Warriors did not disappoint! It was awesome to finally see the end of this long journey. At least the end for now. I just hope Tommy gets a happy ending.'
4	'First book of hers that I have read but drew me straight in, each book independent but will get first book for more background. Death, mystery, romance (good and bad), kidnapping and a whole lot more will keep you reading till you finish then want more.'
5	'I READ A LOT OF MAGAZINES THAT KEEP ME UP-TO-DATE ABOUT HAIR AND MAKEUP TRENDS.  I ACTUALLY DO MOST OF THE THINGS ANGELA SUGGESTS.  IT WAS FUN TO READ HER COMMENTS, THOUGH, AND HER BOOK REMINDED ME THAT I NEED TO BE MORE DILIGENT ABOUT SOME OF HER TIPS.  SHE SOUNDS LIKE A YOUNG PERSON AND SOMEONE WHO WOULD MAKE A GREAT FRIEND!'
5	'a very absorbing read, good plot, nice timing.  I am getting hooked on this series of historical mysteries.  I first encountered the author in an anthology some years ago and the full length novels are just as good as the short stories, if not better.'
5	"The world of Aurora Rising is a wonderfully rich, fleshed out place with characters I fell in love with. I became immersed in it as I followed Alex and Caleb through its vast spaces and its inner workings, and wanted more after I reached the last page of the trilogy. The short stories add to its depth and only increase the need to see more of this world and its people.\n\nIt's an action story, a love story, it's about overcoming those who want to hold humanity down, it's a grand adventure and a mystery. It's epic scifi and yet it's a story about two people caught up in something unexpected. As big as the scope is I never felt lost or overwhelmed. Every character, every scene and every moment had me knowing exactly where I was in the scheme of things and whether I was holding my breath, laughing or crying, I felt like I was there with them. Its richness and wonderful crafting made me not want to put it down until I finished.\n\nI have the paperbacks and when this collection came out I knew I had to have it so I could read it whenever and wherever I wanted when I can't carry the physical book. It's just that good."
4	"Warning!!! SPOILER ALERT!!!You must not read this unless you read Being Me. This is a novella that takes place a day after Being Me ends.\n\nI positively LOVED seeing Mark, Mr. In control all the time, not in control. :)\n\nWhen he meets Crystal, the new sales rep for Riptide, she give him a run for his money. She doesn't back down at all. He doesn't know how to deal with that and he is OK with that. Part of him wants her to take control, but the other 95% doesn't.\n\nIt's a very quick read, 40 pages, so there's not much to say. Mark is one tough cookie and doesn't wanna show weakness, but somehow Crystal creeps in and slowly shows him that the loss of control isn't weakness.\n\nIt ends quite suddenly and now I'm dying to see what comes next!!!"
3	'I expected a lot of "how to\'s" in this book by the title, but it was more of a journal of the author.  It was an interesting read if you are involved with/ or thinking of a small RV.  We also have a Class B, or Van type of motor home and I didn\'t learn anything by reading this book.  It was fun to read what another "member of the fraternity" did with their van camper.'
4	'This book is engaging and clearly written. It is easy to identify with one or more of the characters and to feel at home in the environment. The descriptions of locations and people are full and colorful. Thanks to Andrea Deck for this wonderful first novel.'
5	'Janet delivers again!  Stephanie, Lula, Morelli, and the gang stumble into a deadly mystery that keeps you on your toes.  I loved it!  Highly recommended.'
5	'The book kept me interested from beginning to the end! Absolutely loved this book! I would recommend this book to anyone and will!'
3	"It was ok. Didn't tell me anything that I did not already know."
5	"A wonderfully written story about a woman finding her place in the world after a life of being pushed around and landing a position with the toughest bully she's met yet. With flashbacks from her past life filled with manipulation and worries mixed in with her present situation, the story really comes to life. Absolutely captivating. Thoroughly recommended!"
5	'This book is excellent. There really does seem to be a deep insecurity issue with people who are rude and difficult. This book was well written. Very insightful.'
5	'I have used tennis ball therapy over the years for chronic pain. This book encompasses many of the trigger points that everyone has sooner or later. I highly recommend this as it is concise with just enough photos to walk you through it. Just remember not to "over do" it as you begin.'
5	'This was a great beach read for me, easy to put down and pick right back up.  Light easy and relaxing reading.  I really enjoy this author.'
5	'Another great book by one of my favorite authors.'
1	"Glancing at preface it is immediately apparent that this book has been unsuccessfully OCR'd with disasterous and nonsensical results (provided a sample). STAY AWAY. I would hazard an opinion that someone is streaming Google's library of digitized books into a pipeline for Amazon eBook publishing."
3	'Though I love the Grace Hill books, I don\'t agree with the other readers that this one is a five-star story. It\'s really a combination of familiar plot lines - the lonely, elderly lady who "adopts" a good-hearted boy into her life, the young, flimsy heroine who runs away from the hero for somewhat ridiculous reasons, and a few others thrown in. The character who is transformed is Martha Spicer, a "crabby" old lady who unexpectedly inherits a house and money, and is able to leave her department store drudgery behind for a nicer life.\n\nThis book did bring tears to my eyes a few times, because of the kind acts of Martha Spicer, as she learns that giving is more rewarding than receiving. However, I ultimately didn\'t feel like the story was very strong, maybe because I thought "The Obsession of Victoria Gracen" was a much better story about a similar character, and also I could not stand the young heroine who has to be rescued from death over and over after she runs away into a blizzard. What kind of girl would seriously run into a blizzard and just lie down to die within visible sight of houses, stores and police stations? I was unable to be interested in her. Also, the story disappointed me by missing an opportunity to create a love interest for the main character, Martha Spicer.'
5	"A great extension of the original 5/3/1 & 3/5/1 books. If you're looking to expand from the basic variations this is a must read."
5	'Never gets unexciting. Good story line.  Surprise at the end.  Truly a good series. The characters seem real and stick to their characters'
1	"The book mentions some things you can do but doesn't` tell you how to do it.  It very helpful book."
3	'Interesting, I did not become a great fan of William the Conqueror as a person.'
5	"One of the better romance novels I've read in a long time.  It was hilarious!  I hope to read more of Ms Mara's books."
1	'I found myself hoping through the first third of this book that the author would catch my interest but sadly that never happened. The story line has been done multiple times and unfortunately, done much better. I think the author has talent that is yet undeveloped. Characters lacked depth, story lacked believability and was sadly underdeveloped. I recommend the author learns to  develop their characters, perhaps learning to slow down a little in their development, make them "real" to the reader, and get more objective criticism before releasing.  Message to author? Don\'t give up, get better...'
5	'Awesome book!!!  Great to have all 3 in 1 easy read'
5	'For opera lovers who enjoy scratching beneath the surface of their favorite works, and for anyone interested in the Imperialist presence of "The West" in Asian societies, Pierre Loti\'s novel is highly recommended.  A French naval officer who served throughout east Asia, the Pacific and North Africa, Loti (1850-1923) wrote prolifically about his adventures, which included liaisons with a rather large number of women wherever he went (continuing the operatic connection, his Le Marriage de Loti inspired Leo Delibes\' opera Lakme).  Virtually all his "novels" are autobiographical, based on his own military, cultural and sexual activities.\n\nMadame Chrysantheme was a Cio-Cio-San without the sentiment and suicide, a contract bride happy to collect her money for the services she rendered and then await the next foreign customer.  This edition is a large format paperback featuring a very good, uncredited translation, printed in a typewriter-like font that appears gray rather than black because it is so thin.  There are also occasional typos that one can figure out with some ease and a little annoyance.  Is it worth it?  Yes, if one wants the novel in English at all and at a reasonable price.  In revealing the attitudes and expectations of Europeans bent on annexing what they thought of as lesser peoples for their countries\' benefit, it is a worthwhile look into the origins of the political, social and cultural conflicts we are still working out today.  And Loti was a great observer wherever he went.'
4	"I purchased this story because I have been impatiently waiting for anything more on this story line. The ONLY thing I can fault is that this is a shorter story. Up til release of Twisted, I had re-read all of the precluding books. (I usually do this with series as they are usually many months in between release dates!) I was totally hyped about getting more of this storyline down, however it was nice to finally get the past for Maggie. Seriously can not wait until Jase's story is out!"
5	"I found this children's story very fun and engaging. I loved all the cultural aspects of it, since I don't know all that much about Malaysia or Singapore. I thought that the characters were easy to relate to and seemed like real people. The plot itself was exciting and easy to follow. Even though the story was fantasy and not realistic fiction, I still felt that it was believable and that the author did a good job of weaving magic and reality together. I liked how Little Orchid learned lessons from the magical realm that helped her better understand her own world. Altogether, this is an enjoyable read and a nice addition to any children's collection."
5	'from a retired army mp it was a great read'
5	"I have read Sue Monk Kidd's The Secret of Bees, so knew I enjoyed her writing. The Invention of Wings was equally well written & covered an era of history from two viewpoints, both unfamiliar to me. Quite enlightening. I didn't want the story to end. I'm looking forward to her next book!"
5	'Loved this story it kept me wondering if the two main attractions would ever accept each other. The frolic was a blast and a supersize.'
5	"I don't like the books. Loved from the start. Couldn't put my kindle down."
5	"I read the Kindle version of this book and loved it.  Pictures in it are terrific.  A very thorough treatment of the star and the man.  Great background material for all the movies made and of John Wayne's life....his triumphs and struggles in his personal and public life.  A complete, honest, and enlightening version  of the life and times of an icon still very much a part of our lives today."
5	"I loved it!!!  So far all of the books that I've read, by Alix Nichols, have been wonderful. I can't seem to stop reading them. I've read 6 so far. I've purchased all of the series in this book and this is the 1st one in the series that I've read. I'm about to read book 2, 3, 4."
5	'enjoy the product very much'
5	"If you're looking for something to read aloud to an unusually bright child on a winters night, try this. For such a small book the range and contrast is astonishing, from the sheer wit and lightness of touch of the princess and the pea to the chilling drama of red as roses. Its clear the author is in love with words, and knows far better than most how to use them. I thoroughly enjoyed this from start to finish."
5	'Loved the book and the characters. However, I felt that Christopher and Ailsa should have told the press the real story and how the father bullied them and took away Christophers business and livelihood. In the end, Love is what mattered.'
5	'Fast paced and keeps you moving with a little sci fi thrown in. Especially liked the way star crossed romance tied it all together.'
2	'It is a good book - though somewhat repetitious.  It gives clear explanation of the plan of salvation and how to become a Christian. However, this was not the book I was looking for.'
5	'Enjoyed this book. It was fun reading. Open it and see for yourself. I would read it again and again.'
5	"I can't praise Morrigan's work enough. Always an excellent read, and you can't really go wrong grabbing this at least for the ereader. Love the series!"
5	"I have surely enjoyed this book , it has been a blessing to me reading, and mediating, on the Lord and what He done for us.  It's always good to read and learn from others, in what they have learned to be a blessing to other people. And pass it on so we can  all, learn all we have a way to that given to us."
5	'I really enjoyed the schedule that was in this little book. I have gardened for years and never got the hang of "when" to start seeds indoors. I`\'ll be using Ed`s time table this year, and his idea for grow lights.  If you like growing your own veggies, this booklet is worth a read!'
5	'This author is not in prison. Please remove the negative previous negative review.'
5	'Sharon Delarose has created a book that people who are interested in animals and nature should enjoy. This is a book obviously written as a result of a great deal of meticulous work that is slightly unconventional, but contains a wealth of information. As well as the very interesting facts, I liked the excellent pictures taken by the author of often tiny animals that are difficult to photograph.\nI thoroughly recommend it and hope a lot of people will share my enjoyment. King of the Forest deserves a wide audience.'
5	'I love Douglas Adams.  Very funny of course but also the quality of his writing is amazing.  My vocabulary makes outstanding progress whilst reading his novels and I am frequently referring to my dictionary for assistance I am not ashamed to say.  But his stories are the best!  The characters are so bizarre yet perfectly right for his madcap plots.  I wish he were still here.'
5	"I don't recall ever finishing any other series as fast as I did with this series. The anticipation about what would happen next was more anticipated than any other book I have read. The storylines were very well written and the storytelling was wonderfully done. I find myself truly sadden to see such a great series end. I will highly recommend this series to others."
5	"Happy to have this, have not tried the full download where ALL the day's news goes to the device and then you take with you.  Would be good if you go to work by train, commute, slug line etc.  Nice app"
5	'I totally LOVE this series!!!!!!! I wish it could go on after the last book when it comes out!!! I just can not put it down when I start reading!!!!!'
4	'Great series. In this installment all questions are answered. Justice is doled out to most but not all. King definitely got what he deserved for being the catalyst for the feud between himself and Wolfe. Kendall ultimately gets his justice. Marcus, Quentin and Renata got slighted in the justice department.'
5	"Very impressive and interesting to read. This book is very informative and well written. It's packed with useful information about different types of hacking. A great guide for beginners because it has step by step guide on how to execute each tip and every detail are discussed really well."
5	'"Dear Julia" by Romy Sommer is my first read by this author and will not be my last. We have Rosalie Stanton who loves to \'fix\' things, and Commander William Cavendish who is kind of a recluse.  Rosalie finds an envelope with "Julia" written on the outside and returns it to William.  Julia and Rosalie are similar in looks, and she makes it a mission to \'fix\' William.  Set in Post WWII era their romance has you cheering for this couple as they become closer.'
4	'A sweet read; takes on the topic of sexual assult. This is mostly a light entertaining read, waiting for book 2 now.'
4	'With the passage of time we understand what in our youth was incomprehensible.  In the novel the author recounts some experiences from her childhood involving a rebellious father who she comes to understand in her mature years. A nice soty which happens during the dark days of the Argentine military dictatorship.'
5	'Great read'
5	'I like the concept of the dash diet.  Its not a crash diet or one that restricts everything I like.  The food included in the diet are rich in fiber, vitamins, and minerals. Potassium, magnesium, and calcium are necessary to control blood pressure, and are essential components to this diet. You can use the DASH diet to lose pounds in a few weeks without feeling hungry or deprived.\n\nThere are several steps outlined in this book to make the DASH diet easy to follow. I like how the DASH diet incorporates slow cooking methods which makes meal preparation convenient. This saves me a lot of time with my busy schedule. Plus there is a benefit of less dishes to wash! Simple to follow recipes and good pictures makes this easy to follow. I like how this book gives you a selection of breakfast, lunch, dinner recipes along with some tasty soups and stews.  Cook up a storm!'
4	"To be honest the first 2/3 chapters, was weird, I was about ready to hit delete.\nI don't like not to finish a book, so I kept going,  The rest of the book I did not\nput down, until I finished it."
3	'Look, this is not going to keep you burning for more, but it\'s fun, entertaining, and helps stave off "brain rot" or Alzheimers.  I think it does cause the user to sharpen his/her vocabulary, but it\'s not a intellectually "growing".  Place it on the same level as Poker or Blackjack simulations.  Put it on your Kindle for entertainment while you wait.'
4	"...better and better. I'm a sucker for a love story with a happily ever after. billionaires are just people too, right! they have lots more money, of course, but at the end of the day they're just people and want the same things as everyone else. I'm a sucker for a bossy alpha male too, especially if it's all in love with a good dose of respect.\n\nThanks to the author for addressing some key societal issues - drug abuse, alcoholism, child abuse, foster care and adoption. It makes the story more real even in the world of a billionaire."
5	"I generally don't like the business fable format, but this is an exception. The book is concise (took just over an hour) and the story-telling is well done, with just whats needed to make the points. The eleven values are well explained with useful real-life examples, and paint a picture of a business with people at the center of the culture. It also makes the case that culture fit is the most important part of building and growing your team.\n\nMy favorite part is the story of custom-printing a childrens book to close a sale.\n\n(Disclosure: I know David, but I bought and reviewed this on my own initiative. I was going to skim it enough to say nice job next time I see him, but ended up reading the whole book in one session. Im reviewing it because it actually delivered value: Im going to use ideas from this book in my business.)"
4	'This romance novel was predictable, but easy and enjoyable reading. I finished it in one evening.  The author was one I would definitely  read again.'
5	'I have read both books in this series.  Fascinating characters!  I am waiting for the next book in the series to come out!!!  PKG'
4	"A sweet predictable Christian romance. It's the typical story of a girl from a troubled family meeting Mr. Right, but in a unique way."
5	"The author states this book is written for ages 2 - 7 and P - 1.  However, if your child is anxious about you leaving him/her the story could easily be read to older children.\n\nPaddy (top left) does not want her mom to leave her at Miss Buffy's house.  Her mom tells her that 'grown-ups always come back'.  Not that this helps Paddy as she is not happy with her mom for leaving her.  At first, Paddy is mad but after a period of time she becomes sad and lonely.  And, naturally she keeps wondering when, and more importantly IF, Mom will return.\n\nMiss Buffy is an excellent sitter.  First, she plays with her, then a snack is served, finally a story is read which makes Paddy sleepy. What a marvelous sitter Miss Buffy is and she certainly knows how to take Paddy's mind off her Mother.\n\nJust a delightful story for the anxious little ones in your family.  The drawings are cute and colorful and the Zoom is also in effect on the Kindle.\n\nMost highly recommended."
5	'Great read! Keeps your interest and keeps you guessing! I love the fact there is a touch of romance without going into details about intimacy... finally a good "clean" book with great characters.'
4	"I'm already looking forward to the next one. Carl Weber left me with a lot of questions which is why I gave the book a 4 instead of 5"
5	"It was nice to have a billionaire that wasn't a controlling jerk and an older collage student that was smart, caring, and not a doe eyed virgin. I smiled while reading."
5	'Everyone should have a copy of this and read it at least once a year!! Doing so would allow them to have a better understanding of what a government should not be doing!!'
3	"I was going to give this four stars, since I liked the characters (particularly Rae and Kip), and since the situations and setting are fun. The mercantile spacer theme is reminiscent of Norton and Heinlein, and I was excited to see a more modern take on those ideas.\n\nThen I got past the half-way mark, and I really can't justify more than three stars. The frequency of typos just keeps increasing. LOTS of tense errors and missing words, and there's even one place near the end where the sentence I have received an email from Mrs. Fox was inserted into the middle of a word. Neither a Mrs. Fox nor email appear anywhere else in the book. I'm perfectly happy with typos in fanfic, but if I'm paying for a book, I expect something at least one proofreader has gone over.\n\nThere's structural issues with the story as well. At few points were any of the crew in danger, or have anything more than bruised pride at stake. The domestic drama is fairly well executed and pulls you along, but isn't explored in enough depth to make up for the lack of movement on the external plot. The ending also failed to satisfy me. None of the threads are brought to conclusion, and it's left unclear whether one of the characters did something horrible, and if so, why. Taken together with the other structural issues, this feels like the first quarter of a story rather than a proper novel.\n\nAs I said, I wanted to like it, but between the typos and structural issues, I don't think I'll be reading any sequels."
3	'This was a good book. My major disappointment was how it ended. Even if you had ended it with an epilogue would have helped. I hate when books leave you hanging and wanting more.'
5	'good information'
5	'I received this item for free in return for an honest review. Having said that, there are a few neutral reviews about this book but i gave it 5 stars because its exactly what it said it was, its memes. Its not Hamlet or Moby Dick but its not meant to be those things. Its exactly what it says, memes. Its like having a funny friend send you a bunch of memes they found online. Its what you would expect. No complaints here, i thought it was a cute book.'
1	"I bought this book and even though it was only .99 I wish I would have saved my money. I am a writer and I hate to critique other writers but I did not enjoy this book, in fact I didn't finish it. The heroine was hard to like and very selfish. The story was hard to follow, it jumped all over. I read a lot of books and this was one of the worst."
5	'Love to read the reflections of the daily readings.  Reading the prayers at the back of the booklet are a great way to start and end the day.'
5	"Reverence is a military/political story about engineered soldiers. Used to maintain law and order in a repression regime, their memories are repressed, their emotions (or lack thereof) checked. One of the themes of the book, Reverence, is loyalty:\nThe only real key to self-preservation is loyalty: unconditional and undying, not to a single man or a group. No, to a single ideology: a thing that never ceases to exist.\n\nMilitary isn't my usual genre. Nor is explicit gore (as many military books contain) and torture and carnage. So I was surprised I really enjoyed this book.\nIt touches on authoritarian rule, with leaders having at their disposal seemingly unkillable soldiers who crush opponents. Any resistance is hunted down, and civilians are manipulated to think that they are kept safe with the existence of such soldiers.\nWhat elevates the book to a five-star, IMO, is the authors inclusion of interpersonal relationships. As an example, Luis defies orders to protect the Chancellor Venloran and protects Bia instead and thus making Will the second-in-command. Luis frustration and emotional outburst at Bias demise show his human side, blurring the line between man and machine, between right and wrong. Luis is a victim as are all other cyborgs. Will, the main character, plagued by dreams, grows and questions his blind loyalty, when Valerie enters the scene, an image from his past.\nThe story shifts from 2065 and 2044 but its not distracting as the flashbacks are all tied up in the end. Halsey, a soldier himself, tortured for his involvement in the rebel cause, stands for strong morals as head of the Crimson Angels. The Chancellor despite his evils loves his wife. It is this humanity, and not caricatures characters that kept me engrossed in the book.\n\nOverall, its an excellent read, well-balanced, and structured. Half-way through the book, we come across the cyborgs kryptonite to neoartium, and Will is captured. Scenes are mirrored a quarter in the book, we see the cyborgs casually mixing and bantering with the normal soldiers in the gym (underlying tension nevertheless), lifting weights and doing squats and pull-ups. Close to the end, the same cyborgs face the normal soldiers in the gym in a stand-off and are taunted as freaks. The novel is well-balanced as it alternates well between action and low-key/romance/light scenes. Some technical weapons are mentioned, but they are weaved in so well and their description short enough that they don't distract from the story.\nThe fight, in the end, is almost cinematic, as weve been exposed to Marvel movies reminiscent of Superman with Zod. Gripping.\nThe prose style flowed well and easy. The book is action-packed and concise, the forays into the past relevant. With all the twists/betrayals, I found myself immersed in the story -most of the actions being showed, i.e., I could easily visualize them.\n\nThe only snag I had (I didn't pick up Wills name in the blurb) was a confusing beginning. I usually feel comfortable following one point of view per chapter. So it was jarring to skip from head to headWe start chapter 1 in Colonel Husans head, then jump to Commander Kane then back, and then move to Luis thoughts and Will to a soldier. But once I get used to jumping from one head to another, this technique actually helps to move and quicken the pace.\n\nI do recommend this book, a mix of dystopian, sci-fi, genetic engineering, and horror. A satisfying end that raised many questions for Wills future and son. Its frightening that this story takes place only thirty years in the future.\nI am looking forward to reading more books by the author."
5	"I really like this author's FBI series. Great secondary characters and I'm always a sucker for old flames reunited mixed with mystery and intrigue."
5	"Another great story from P O Dixon, So Far Away pick up where Lady Elizabeth ended.  Elizabeth retuned to her biological family, soon she realized that Mrs Bennett is consumed with marrying off her daughters.  While Mr Bennett is engross with self pity and hatred that he omit his responsibility to his family. The only person who understand Elizabeth is Darcy, however he have his own problem with his cousin. Will Darcy's situation ended his relationship with Elizabeth?  I like the way Ms Dixon weaved the original story in this variation."
3	"I did enjoy the book although was completely disheartened with the cliffhanger as I try desperately not to have to read 2, 3, 4, 5 books to get to the meat of a storyline. It moved a touch slower in development than I would have liked and I kept waiting for solid movement in the storyline which never came. The writing was good but just not enough to grab me and not let go. I wanted to see what came next, but when I realized I would need to wade through four more books before the punchline I will be honest in saying I'm not sure I will finish this series.  The characters of Aiden and Lucy seem to have lots of good history, but not a huge amount of depth given to that and way to much attention given Chelsea the obvious shallow girlfriend. I LOVE LOVE LOVE a good romance and this book was lots of foreshadowing of romance and NO ROMANCE of any kind - the characters are just now hinting that they might be interested at each other. I would have APPRECIATED a bigger hook of romance to keep me coming back in this book, but instead it just felt like setting the scene for a larger storyline that will be continued. Even when books are serial in nature such as this I really need a big draw in the first book to bring me back for more and unfortunately I didn't feel it in this book."
5	'Lord have mercy. This is a page turner. You can just grab you a bottle of wine, milk and cookies because you will most likely finish this in one night. As the old saying goes, the freaks come out at night.'
4	'I jumped in right in the middle of this series. I enjoyed it once I figured out what was going on. The story felt a bit rambling at times but overall I loved it. Definitely going to grab up the other books.\n\n As always Joe Hempel did a wonderful job. Very enjoyable.\n\nI was voluntarily provided this free review copy audiobook by the author, narrator, or publisher.'

5	'Well organized book'
5	'I enjoy reading the experiences and viewpoints of others. This is something I was not allowed to do as a cult member. Cutting one off from other terminals and viewpoints is the goal of any cult.'
3	"This is the craziest book I've read in a while! If this story is true She must be a Medium and not know it. She sees ghosts alot and has alot of experiences with the paranormal and the way She writes is funny as hell! She's rough around the edges to be nice and must live in a bad area of town for sure. Still the book did keep my attention and was interesting."
5	'First off I want to say that I absolutely loved this book. It was an easy read and I couldn\'t wait to see what would happen next. I was able to share in Haleigh\'s frustrations, as well as rejoice in her happiness. The love story was sweet, cute and funny and Haleigh was down to earth, unpretentious and just the right amount of vulnerable. I could relate to Haleigh like she was an older me, someone who loves Ian Somerhalder (because trust me, I LOVE Ian Somerhalder) and I even loved the fact that she was a homebody at heart. She had a mature voice for being a senior in high school but she also sounded realistic for her age. She\'s someone I could definitely see befriending in high school. The dialogue was fun, witty and never dragged. I was on the edge of my seat with anticipation to see what was going to happen next between Haleigh and Mika. I loved the sexual tension and I enjoyed the backdrop of the "will they or won\'t they" relationship of Haleigh and Mika. It was always there, just quietly simmering in the background until it eventually erupted! And trust me, when it erupted, it was HOT. And hot damn! I ADORED Mika. He was a great hero--not a bad boy, just an all round nice and decent guy and it just shows you that the nice guy can sometimes get the girl in the end. Not all us girls are into the bad boys. I also laughed out loud while reading this book as the author has a keen eye for satire. The full cast of supporting characters were interesting and helped bring the book together. Along the way, there were loads of fun, funny moments and growing up as Haleigh navigated the challenges of falling in love with her best friend. This was a fantastic start to what I hope is a long line of books. A solid 5 stars.'
5	"This is the first book that I have read by this author and I am now a fan. This was a sweet love story that will make you laugh, cry and root for Eunice and Blake's happy ending."
5	'I absolutely adored this book. Loved the characters and the build up to their relationship especially, and the delicious dynamics at work between them all.'
4	"This story is worth reading. It is worth your time. For anyone that is at all wondering about what it means to follow God, this book will hopefully help you along that journey. You should read this if you are curious, questioning, open-minded, and.or a believer that love is always the answer. You should especially read this if for any reason, you have felt trapped by the organized Christian church, and are wondering if there might be another way. Maybe that's too blunt, but I know a lot of Christians that struggle with what they hear in church. There's a difference between religion and faith, which is something that Mick Mooney helped me see when I was feeling trapped.\n\nIt is my hope, and was my hope while reading SNAP, that this story can help anyone that is willing to read it and give it a chance. SNAP challenges the reader to think about what is really worth having in life, and if religion is the answer above love. It will challenge people to look at what they are putting first in life, and if that really lines up with what they preach. I loved this story, and its message will stay with me for a long time.\n\nHope this helps someone. It's not a thousand pages, and it won't kill you to read it... so seriously, just read it. :) It just might change your perspective."
3	'I have read several Connolly novels and enjoyed them very much.  These shot stories seemed very predictable which is very unlike his novels.'
5	"This book kept me interested to the point I didn't want to put it down until I finished it.  Jessica writes so well that I feel what the characters feel and become apart of the story.  I would recommend this book or any other if you are into reading romance novels."
3	'I am a life-long reader of fantasy and sci-fi. To begin with, regardless of the word "unicorn" in the title, this is not a fantasy story. It is more or a commentary on living with roomates and the human condition, with a black-humor twist. Reminded me a little bit of some Peter S Beagel short stories. All in all, I found the writing style good, the viewpoint unique and refreshing, and the story breif, but solid.'

5	'Excellent book that answered my basic questions relating to hedging physical interests in commodities. Tim does a great job of providing examples that the reader may be able to apply to their particular circumstances. The book does not get bogged down in the details of things like formulas. Easy to read and gain insight. Thanks Tim!'
3	"Tough to get through..really enjoyed mishhka's book about the little mouse and him growing up. although i wanted to see the outcome I just kept thinking ah come on smarten up already....."
5	"This is a good read for people interested in structural changes in the retail industry and the future of omni-channel and hypermarket formats. It was very useful to learn about Simon's experience at Tesco. I believe that his findings are even more relevant today when there is so much disruption in the industry."
5	"Huge cliffhanger at the end. I couldn't put it down!"
5	"I usually rate a book on how good a story it is but I can't do that with this novel. As I began to read it ceased to be a story and became a world through which I traveled and instead of charaters being introduced to the story line I felt I was meeting them personally. I haven't been this immersed in a book in a long time. I can't wait for the next one."
4	"Lots of really great info,however, I ran into a couple of problems.  There was no camera in the ed explorer.  And I can't get the dolphin browser because the kindle is not supported by google play. If these are possible, and I'm doing something wrong (even though I followed directions), more explanation is needed.  I did learn a lot though about my new kindle fire."

5	'Soft yet firm. Funny and lovable. What a lady looks for yet may find it impossible to find. This story reflects what many seek to find. A good solid relationship built on trust and respect. Well written and easy to read. Not over the top in regard to the discipline.'
4	"My Thoughts (full review):\n\nNoelle Adams always has the loveliest stories. Unlike the majority, I adore novellas. They're short and sweet and when an author does them right, they are perfection. The first book in the Beaufort Brides spinoff series has hooked me yet again.\n\nHere we have Vanessa who lost her husband 3 years ago. She hasn't moved on because of underlying guilt. Then there's Joe, the one guy who always gets in her way and under her skin, and not in a good way. They're stuck together for the time being, so they have to learn to work together and deal with each other. It doesn't take long for the desire to come forth and create all sorts of challenges.\n\nOne Week with her Rival was a brilliant start to the Eden Manor series! I loved the backstory of Vanessa and how she learned to cope and allowed herself to live life again. Joe was amazing and so wonderful with Vanessa, I wanted to just hug him tight. All in all, another excellent novella from the master of novellas.\n\nMy Rating: Very Good"
3	'Bree and Todd share their journey from an adolescent to an adult relationship that was based on friendship and love from start to finish. I enjoyed the journey with them. Just the right amount of spice.'
5	'I agree that we all want and need the American dream in our lives.  We need to help one another, give to one another so they can help themselves, teaching them  the way so that they can do the job, just as good! The arts give us something  to strive for.. the pictures on our walls, the photography..it makes the world even more beautiful, and it would be nice to have these sort of things to work towards.'
3	"I loved it  was a good book but then at the end was so stupid! I loved the beginning but then the ending didn't make any since"
5	"This is the fourth book in this series and grabs you just like the first three and doesn't let go until you've finished the book. Giovanni is an Alpha Billionaire Property Developer who rescues Cassie, a well known movie star, when she is almost hit by a taxi running from the paparazzi and a crazed stalker. They are attracted to each other but Gio likes his privacy and Cassie is in the lime light. Can they find a middle ground or is their relationship doomed? You'll have to read this book to find out. It's full of drama, suspense, hot sex, and of course, love with a HEA. Can't wait for the next book.  I received this book as a gift for an honest review.  Patsy Sacco"
5	"Tommy is a young boy who loves to fart.  He is so passionate about farting that he gives them names.  His mom doesn't like all of the farting and takes him to the doctor, changes his diet but nothing works.  Tommy decides to see if he can produce a fart powerful enough to make him fly.  He fills up on all of the gassy foods he can find puts on his helmet for safety and lets out the biggest fart he has ever produced.  It works.  He flies all the way to the moon.  There is a problem.  He has to get back to earth.  He meets an alien on the moon who feeds him all kinds of things to help him build up gas to produce another fart.  But, Tommy forgets to aim for the earth and ends up on Mars.  Now he has an even bigger problem.  I can't wait  to read the sequel to see what the author does with this character.  It was great reading it to my grand-daughter.  It gave us the opportunity to predict what might happen in the next book.  Very cute."
5	'Great series. Be sure to start at the beginning.'
4	'This book is written to be quite British.  The story is fun. Great light reading.'
4	'The only thing that bothers me of the book is that it is too fast pace.  Very short should be longer to understand the characters a lot more.  Very good though overall'
4	'This author really knows slave training and I love every bit of this book, If you want romance read something else.'
5	'Had a difficult time putting this book down and finished in two nights. Action packed with great characters. Highly recommend.'

5	'Good anthology - a great read'
5	"Couldn't  down. Really good book"
3	'The first chapter is majestic. Kissinger, an acknowledged master diplomat  and statesman, explains how China has always differed form other countries, how the Chinese themselves have often perceived that difference., and what principles govern their foreign policy. What comes later, however, is disappointing; plain diplomatic history consisting as one of my professors used to say, of "what one secretary told another."\n\nI did not bother to read it to the end.'
5	"It's not only the story line which defines a book, but the writing style of the author as well. I have read 1000 yards, and In Cold Blood, and immediately looked forward to reading other books written by Mark Dawson. Both lead characters, John Milton in 1000 Yards, and Beatrice Rose in In Cold Blood were intriguing and complex. The storyline kept me interested  throughout, and I immediately, upon finishing one book, downloaded another book by this author. Too often I have read books where the plot is entertaining, but the characters are fair, or the writing is elementary and uninteresting. Thankfully, this is not so with Mark Dawson and I look forward to reading more of his books."
5	"This book is the real thing I've been looking for to help me improve. You can read a lot about sailing tactics etc. but if you're body isn't up to it, it's a waste of time, you have to do the work. The author has been in the Olympics and a World Champ and is now a coach of current world champs, is sports scientist as well as a sailor is generous with what he's learned and experienced. Some of the training exercises are hard, much too difficult if you're not fit but it shows how to build yourself up. Good advice on diet which can really help. Worth having a look at his dvd of crossing Bass Strait in a Laser, you'd need to be REALLY fit to do that!"
4	"I really enjoyed reading this story especially having gone on a cruise very similar to the cruise this author wrote about.  The only reason why I didn't give this story five stars was because the story could have been written with the cruise being a chartered Christian cruise with only Christian entertainment such as the Bill Gaither cruises which is similar to the one I had gone on.  I appreciate the author keeping this story clean and with Christian moral values.  I also enoyed reading about the same excursions I had gone on while in Cozumel and the Caymen Islands and how accurate the author was with the details.  I just wish I could have met my prince charming on my cruise as Alyson did on hers.  I plan on reading this authors other books and will recommend this story to my friends."
5	"Heart breaking I couldn't tell either. It was a relative. I gave hints but the adults did not get it. He's dead now and I don't miss him at all."
5	'Oh wow, I loved these book and the stories of the lives of these friends and families.  I was engrossed so much in their lives and encouraged by their faith and willingness to put God first above their wants and needs.'
4	"But it's crap that there are so many books and cost so much. I'm not sure I'm gonna purchase anymore."
4	'Good read'
5	'This is a great edition of the novel, full of annotations that explain the meanings and usages of words from the time period.  Although this story can - and is - enjoyed without the annotations, this version is a rich companion to the various other popular versions.  It is also a fine looking volume.  As to the story, we would be hard pressed to find people not familiar with A Christmas Carol, by Charles Dickens, due to several movies the novel has spawned. I finally sat down and read the novel and am glad I did. The novel by the prolific and popular Dickens is well-written with great characters. That the author can generate such imagery and fully-realized characters in such a short story, is a testament to his staying power. This book packs an emotional punch, and is a great tale for the holidays, or any time you need to remind yourself to be thankful for what you have and those around you. A classic story and a must read. 5 stars.'

4	'Make Me is the first book I have read by Amanda Heath. It won\'t be the last.  I\'ve already downloaded several more. I really enjoyed this "Cinderella" book. It followed a basic formula, but had it\'s own flavor to be original. Nothing cliche. It was refreshing to not have to deal with high school mean girls and pettiness. I liked that she mentioned Tijan; you can see the influence. I happen to love Tijan, so it works for me as well.\n\nPaisley and Channing are both good lead characters, so damaged, yet so strong. Difficult to get to know; made for one another.  Paisley has been living hand to mouth in a broken down trailer, a surrogate mother to her 2 yr old sister. She\'s a good girl, easy to like, but barely getting by. That all changes when her mom od\'s and she is returned to her extended family; a sudden heiress. Channing is the poor rich boy next door; the boy she\'s supposed to marry. He\'s gorgeous, but emotionless. A perfect stranger to all but his best friend. He\'s dark and brooding most of the time, but his glimpses of vulnerability and sweetness make him irresistible. There is instant physical attraction and some type of connection between the two, but whether it will ever play out is in question because neither is willing to risk more pain. Their interactions are a fascinating, frustrating dance. The supporting cast of classmates and family pads the story around them and introduces other characters for future books.\n\nMy only complaint is the editing. The book contains multiple typos and grammatical errors and could have benefited from another round of editing. Still, not enough to keep me from the next book in the series. I would recommend this one.'

This group is infamous for various criminal acts including: the starvation deaths of 12 infant children in Arboles, Colorado; the starvation deaths of 2 children in Placentia, California; the LSD drugging and raping of underage run away boys in Albion, California; the unsolved murder of Ray Shlipman who was an Oahspe Publisher, and some 15 UFO doomsday cults in Anaheim, California from 1970 to 1986, and another UFO Doomsday Cult in Australia.\n\nThis book breeds complete INTOLERANCE, for everyone who is not a follower of this MIND CONTROL CULT.  It teaches hatred for the Christians, Jews, Muslims, Hindu, Buddhists, doctors, lawyers, organized democracy, free speech, and freedom of religion. This book is Xenophobic,  Anti-Woman, and Anti-Family.\n\nMany UFO/Doomsday cults have been based on this SICK BOOK, and many people have been harmed physically and psychologically by association with these Oahspe Bible Religious Cults.  These cults have destroyed many marriages, destroyed family relationships, ruined many careers, and caused people to just walk away from their family and children, to go live in a cult commune waiting for the end of the world.\n\nThis cult excels at destroying relationships between family members who have a different religion or belief system.  Typically a cult leader starts humiliating and brow beating any member who has a loved one outside the cult.  They harp and bicker, brow beat and abuse the cult member until finally they cut off all association with family and friends.  This cult has a totalitarian world view that cannot tolerate any member to have outside influences.\n\nThis is why this cult, for over 147 years, has continually destroyed the families and friendships of cult members and their children.  If a cult member has a husband or wife who breaks away from the cult, the cult leader\'s of this sick religion will go out of their way to destroy that relationship.  If the cult member has a father or mother who is not in the cult, or has left the cult, they will destroy that relationship also.\nIt is all about controlling the cult member, controlling who their friends are, controlling who they marry, controlling what they read, controlling what they watch on TV, and controlling what they read in the newspaper.\n\nNow, with the internet, these FANATICS, are RANTING AND RAVING about this and that quotation from Oahspe that they repeat like a PARROT.  It is like listening to a ROBOT read Chinese.  They all seem like brainwashed ZOMBIES, who have no idea what they are saying.\n\nOne simple truth is certain.  These OAHSPE BIBLE MIND CONTROL CULTS are recruiting new members as you read this, in their YOUTUBE media blitz.  They are almost as PROLIFIC as ISIS, the extremist MILITANT ISLAMIC CULT.\n\nAnd speaking of ISIS, were you aware that previous Oahspe BIble Cults have required married male converts to turn over their wives to the Oahspe Bible Cult for SEXUAL BREEDING PURPOSES?\n\nThe Los Angeles Herald, July 14, 1895 issue, investigated a FREE SEX OAHSPE BIBLE CULT in Placentia, California.  Their name was, "Societas Fraternia," and was known to locals as the "Grass Eaters." It was well documented in the Los Angeles Herald, in a five part series that an Oahspe Bible Cult there, was involved in recruiting wealthy land owners in the Placentia, California area, and one of the CULT LEADERS confessed to the Herald reporter that,  "yes,  the cult did require new married men who were joining the CULT, to turn over their wives to the cult for SEXUAL BREEDING PURPOSES."\n\nTwo cult members of "Societas,"  were indicted on murder charges in the death of a one year old infant, who was literally starved to death.  According to published reports, the infant was raised from birth on PEELED apples. At one years old, it was nothing but SKIN and bones. This child was so ill it couldn\'t even move or cry. The child was placed in FOSTER care, but was so sickly it died shortly after.\n\nGeorge R. Hinde, and Dr. Louis Schlesinger were indicted on murder charges, but the trial in Orange County, California was later dropped because of the horrible publicity the murder trial was bringing the Orange County, California region.\n\nGeorge R. Hinde, was also involved in starving his own 18 year old daughter to death, who was not keen on Oahspe, or a vegetarian diet. The father, locked his daughter in her room and gave her bread and water for two years. A coroners inquest found that, Alice Hinde, the daughter of the cult leader, George R. Hinde, died after a two-year diet of bread and water, and was buried in an unmarked grave in the garden, out the back door, without even a gravestone. The cult leader hid the body in an unmarked grave, so authorities would not find out he murdered his own daughter by starving her to death. A coroner\'s inquest found that Alice Hinde was starved to death.\n\nAnother Oahspe Bible Cult, in Arboles, Colorado was also documented in many, many newspapers across the United States.  They were involved in the starvation death of 12 infant children in one year. This occurred in October, 1906, four miles outside the tiny Colorado town of Arboles, Colorado. Of 13 orphan children awarded to this Oahspe Bible Cult group, 12 of those children were starved to death in one year.  6 of those deaths occurred in one month. Two Oahspe Bible Cult leaders were indicted and sent to jail to await trial in the deaths of these children. George C. Rose and Minnie Wheeler were indicted on manslaughter charges of 6 of those infants.\n\nThere have been many many more Oahspe Bible cults, beside the two listed above. I personally lived in an Oahspe Bible UFO DOOMSDAY Cult for 2 years which was almost identical to HEAVENS GATE. This Cult was Universal Light, and was located only 7.5 miles from the Placentia, California cult that starved two children to death.\n\nUniversal Light was a pyramid scheme of endless recruiting scams, designed to recruit people who had read the Oahspe Bible.  The Cult Leader, Mary Lou Brown, AKA, GODDESS OF THE RED STAR, used an unending array of MIND CONTROL, and THOUGHT REFORM techniques to recruit and then retain followers.  These techniques included: Sleep deprivation, poor diet, cult indoctrination, meditation, and an unending diet of conspiracy theories.\n\nMary Lou Brown, was a paranoid schizophrenic, who claimed to have inherited the entire Mafia fortunes, and promised to give anyone who would come live in this Orange County California cult, a free Oahspe Credit Card.  It was all part of a huge recruiting scam involving a con artist named John Cook, who posed as as the assassinated President, John F. Kennedy as part of a huge recruiting scam to induce gullible Oahspe students into joining a destructive mind control cult.\n\nAccording to this scam, a mysterious Mafia Godfather, named Swagmayer of Peoria, Illinois, left the entire Mafia millions to the Faithist movement.  And as the story went, the Godfather\'s will made the JFK impostor, John Cook, executor of the will.\n\nThe entire swindle was a huge recruitment scam to get unsuspecting Oahspe Bible students to come join a dangerous UFO Doomsday cult. As soon as the Mafia Credit Card SCAM went out on her newsletter, her readership went from under a hundred, to almost 2,000 readers. This cult leader recruited over 15 different cult groups of Oahspe Bible Students from 1970 to 1986.  Apparently, Oahspe Bible students from around the world would do anything to share in the Mafia inheritance, and they had no problem that the Mafia fortunes were acquired though murder, illegal gambling, drug running, and human trafficking.\n\nIn reality there was never any Mafia, or Inheritance money, is was all just the result of the severe mental illness of the cult leader who ended up in an insane asylum for two years in Richmond, Texas.  She was later released and died in obscurity.  Many people suffered a lifetime of PTSD and depression by exposure to this doomsday cult.\n\nThe long and short of it, this Oahspe Bible UFO Doomsday cult was waiting for the END OF THE WORLD, a NUCLEAR HOLOCAUST, and JUDGEMENT DAY.  Afterwards, all the CHOSEN ONES, would be gathered up in a giant UFO SHIP, which would whisk everyone off to the moon for two years. Very similar to Heavens Gate.\n\nAnd while they were away, a VENGEFUL Jehovah god, would burn the memory of every person left on the planet with a giant RAY OF WHITE LIGHT, which basically will turn everyone into a ZOMBIE.\n\nAnother Oahspe Bible Cult in Australia, Universal Brotherhood, starting in the 1960s,  led by Fred and Mary Robinson had a similar Oahspe Bible UFO cult consisting of hundreds of members.  These people were also brainwashed and manipulated over many years.  This group was waiting for a UFO rescue, afterward all the nonbelievers would be taken away in UFO Prison ships to taken to other worlds.  Everyone else left on earth would be put on PRISON UFO SHIPs, and taken to PRISON PLANETS.  This cult even built a UFO landing strip for the Space Brothers to land on.\n\nAnother Oahspe Bible Cult in northern California, "Brothers of Shalom," known by locals as "The Three Wise Men" were a homosexual Oahspe Bible Doomsday Cult 125 Miles north of San Francisco on the Pacific coast outside the tiny town of Albion, California.  They have been accused by former members of drugging run away under age boys with LSD and raping them. Also, they are believed by many to allegedly broken into the home of Betty Shuey, in Oregon, and stolen some old proof plates of the Blue Wing Anderson edition of Oahspe.\n\nArnold Aries, a well known investigator of these groups, visited this cult in Northern California in the mid 1970s and reported that they were a Doomsday cult waiting for the end of the world.  He also reported that the "Brothers" had amassed a huge collection of books that were stolen out of public libraries.  Other visitors have reported seeing a huge stash of stolen books 5 feet high and 6 feet in diameter in one of the tents they had.\n\nThis Oahspe Bible Cult lived in homemade plastic sheeting tents on the mountainside and never even installed an outhouse, a chemical toilet, nothing.  In all the years they were their, they never made one improvement, didn\'t have running water, didn\'t have even an outhouse to go to the bathroom. They bathed in the little brooks next to where they went to the toilet in the dirt like animals.\n\nTwo former members, a boy and his younger brother who was 14 years old at the time, have said the group was homosexual and they were drugged with LSD and raped by these three men.\n\nAnother Oahspe Bible Cult, Four Winds Village, outside the town of Tiger, Georgia was the scene of a grisly murder of cult leader Ray Schlipman.  He had just moved to the rural Georgia property the day before, when his body was found on the back of the estate with his head bashed in. $10,000 in cash money was missing from his room that same day.\n\nThese people excel in recruiting vulnerable people who suffer from various mental illnesses or have problems with social isolation, lack of education, or personal problems.  They offer a sense of belonging to these people, but then take full advantage of these people.\n\nSigned,\nOahspe Bible UFO/Doomsday CULT Survivor\nWoodson Payne.\nwoodsonpayne At Gee Mail Dot Com'

5	'Wow!  Amanda Jones has written a wonderful, easy to read book.  She is very talented and writes poems that go to the heart of various medical issues.  She then follows with questions and a space to write your answers.  I believe this book will serve patients and their families well.'
5	'Thank you to the author for providing such an amazing story. The thoughtfulness and detail that went into this book is impeccable.'
1	'The bad guys and the description of their lair was like a poor creation of the many isolated, secretive, out-in-the-wild terrorist camps run by an unconscious, mentally numb band of thugs.'
5	'Its been life changing for me!!!!'
4	"I wasn't exactly a brilliant mathematics student, always messing up things, and hoping to memorize things, but never really understanding the basics. Although this book is very short it is very simple to understand and pleasantly written. I loved 'King henry doesn't usually drink chocolate milk'. I never learned those things when in school! Thanks, Paula!"
5	'A lovely picture book with added humour for younger children.\nSome unusual but easy to remember names for the children to help them identify all of the animals in the book.'
3	"The tale started with such promise, esp after reading 'Page'. However, I soon read the rest with a sense of frustration & irritation. Somehow, the lovely Scottish brogue seemed to wither away,  the more the characters spoke, till it had all disparate but an occasional 'verra' or 'mon'. Then, after the lovely lass loses all propriety and morality, the H decides he should return her home before her reputation is sullied?? Yet her friend is gone one eve & her reputation is lost forevermore?? I appreciated the soul searching within the plot, but nevertheless,  the story just seems to rather lose its way & focus. A fan of this writer, head & shoulders above many of this genre, but still felt the money paid for this one a waste."
5	'This book is awesome!!!!!! My favorite character is L.B!he is cool! He sounds adorable. I also like little red riding hood.'
5	"This series of six books presents the metalsmithing and enameling work of Marion Brown. They would be of value to anyone interested in metal work and jewelry construction, and the enameling process, but also just to enjoy the images. The first three books cover the construction of complex enameled objects; the final three show the design and construction of cloisonn jewelry, with the final book being a workshop on cloisonn jewelry. Each book is well illustrated with color photos showing the details of construction and design, and the expert use of color in the enamels. (If you have one of the newer tablets, I'm sure the color would be even better!)\nThere are a few typographical errors, but they do not detract from the overall impact of the series."
4	'Enjoyed all the twist an turns of the story line.  Makes me want a book 3 to see what Vegas is really like!'
3	'I enjoyed the story but wonder if she graduated from high school as the grammatical errors were really irritating.  In the very first sentence of the story "As the sun SHINED on the early morning dew..."  Also, several places where the word "she" should have been "her."'

4	"Excellent book! Couldn't put my Kindle down. The story proves that even though you do wrong, you can still make someone else happy."
4	'Fans of either/both Will Robie and/or the Camel Club will enjoy this fast-paced, quick read.  Obviously, this is not a novel, so it lacks character development, but the action is fun and nonstop.'
5	'Loved this book! Will be visiting soon and this made me ready to head to the airport today! Bookmarked and highlighted this will be the basis for my 4 night stay. This book read like a conversation with a friend.'
4	'ARC\n\nA Kiss Like This begins when Abby decides to climb out of her cousins second story bedroom window. Not the brightest idea she\'s ever had, but she would rather fall than face embarrassment with her cousin\'s frat brothers. However, when the guy next door comes over and yells at her for being a idiot things go from bad to worse. But for some reason when these two get a good look at each other they can\'t seem to stay away from each other. Things get a little weird at times because they are so awkward and with the "help" of their friends it\'s going to be a wild ride..\n\nI adored this book! Totally, utterly  adored! It\'s amazing how awesome it was! I loved both of the main characters and all of their awkwardness. Then of course, I also liked the side characters throwing their too cents into as well. And the whole plot line was extremely hilarious, and had me highly entertained the whole book.\n\nThe only downer about the book was towards the end. I didn\'t really get the "conflict" that happened. It didn\'t make sense to me at all, and just seemed rather dumb and pointless. I felt the story would have been better with out it. But other than that the rest was really really awesome!'
5	"I always enjoy Anya Wylde's books, but the main character in this book is extremely likeable and you keep rooting for her to win against the odds.  I am looking forward to hopefully a series continuing from where this stops.  Light, enjoyable reading which is what I need after work."

5	'Enjoyed this book tremendously. The characters are just as offbeat as their humor. Thank you a chance to read this book free in exchange for an honest review on instaFreebies. DS'
5	'Just loved this latest book in her series and the best so far. Chance and Vivie  have great chemistry  and Chance is the hottest one so far.  It has family drama, crime and passion, finding love and plot twists ! Dont miss the Chance of reading a great story!!\nGiven this book as an ARC for honest review..'
4	'For her first novella this was very good. I really related to the Angie character. I read it in one setting and cant wait to read more from this author. I enjoyed the fact it was from a male\'s point of view. This is not common in a romanatic style novella. To the author all i have to say is "more,please"'
3	'The latest in this series centers around the rainforest . Story is good, a bit outrageous and quite gory. Characters are the same and the barbs and comedic exchanges are consistent through these works. The book was an easy read. My complaint is that there are a number of "typos" in the "e" edition, with letters missing and some misspelling. This is not an issue limited to these books, but is one i have been bothered by in kindle books i have ordered and read'
5	'This was an excellent story, with interesting characters and fast-paced action. It had just enough detail that one felt like you were included in the adventure with the characters. I learned a lot about hurricanes, sailboats, and airplanes too! It would make a great movie!'
3	'Very light reading.'
2	"First off this ebook should have been .99 cents, it took me 20 min to read. Second, there's  really no ending, do Kane and Cari mate? There was no oomph to this story, even the sex was nothing fancy. I think I read a diff book than the other reviewer and I'm a little mad that I wasted $2.99."
5	'This was a really cute quick read. I read it in an afternoon. The story drew me in immediately. Even though it was short the characters were really developed, you definitely had a sense of who there were.'
5	'The world needs more boy scouts with the ethics and morals from this era.  The book is well written and you can learn a great deal from it, from how to tie a knot correctly, to identifying animals, to how to be a quality person.  I highly recommend this book.'
5	'Excellent read. Loved it. Had some great action in it and also had a bit of funny humor in it at just the right places.  Highly recommend this book and look forward to hearing about a sequel.'
1	"Why I'm giving one is that I'm thinking this not that useful as what I expected. What I learnt is simply company name-project name-keywords, this point is useful the rest is just like repetition of the daily emailing issues.  What am I expecting is the email formats, business sentences to take as ref. instead of those commen sense."
2	'I MAY TRY SOME OF THESE FOR A DIFFERENT NEW TASTE FOR THE HOLIDAYS. time will tell if they become a favorite'
5	"I really enjoy the Jess Williams Series although they would be more enjoyable if there weren't so many misspellings, grammatical errors, and misuse of words."
5	'This was a treat. A comedy horror story with a crew of practical joking vampires. I laughed out loud several times, but it also has some pretty hardcore violence in it, and some serious moments.  I think the contrasting tones worked well.\n\nThe writer has a natural gift for dialogue, and Spencer, the main narrator character, was likable despite his fiendishness. I also enjoyed all the pop culture references.'
5	'Very well written - good story'
4	'My wife found a copy of Carole Nelson Douglas\'s Irene Adler book, "Goodnight Mr. Holmes" in a used book store and gave it to me. After reading the book, I was hooked on Douglas\'s Victorian age woman\'s libber who "blithely flouts conventions" and still seems to succeed in all she does. The depiction of Adler\'s character is so reminiscent of Holmes himself, which make sense when we remember that Irene was ". . . the only woman Sherlock Holmes admired" and indeed she lives up to the statement.  Judy Alter said "Douglas has made Adler a superb detective and invented a perfectly delightful -and perfectly puzzling - series of cases for her."\n\nThis short story, which is currently only available on Kindle, is an enjoyable continuation of Douglas\'s intriguing series of Adler and Holmes.  Douglas\'s "The Private Wife of Sherlock Holmes" reveals the pair\'s most recent encounter in good old London as they investigate a high society brothel that uses a new invention, the gramophone, as a blackmail tool!  There are many Sherlockian deductions, by both Holmes and Adler; however, the story belongs to Irene and her wit, charm, and reason.\n\nThe story is really too short; I prefer the novel over the short story.  I still enjoyed the story; however, I would have liked it fleshed out even more. Still, I really enjoy Douglas\'s characterization of Irene as an intellectual, talented heroine who succeeds both as a singer and as a detective. She is a unique and unconventional woman for any time period, but certainly during the Victorian era, she raises a few eyebrows. Irene is witty, competent, competitive, adventurous, and a master of observation and even a la Holmes, a master of disguises (her theatre background).  After the story comes an up to date "Afterword" by Douglas herself, which even mentions Downey Jr.\'s movies and the wonderful Laurie King\'s Mary Russell with Holmes series.  The "Afterword" contains some interesting information about herself, her writing, and finally, a very long sample of the first book in the Irene Adler series, "Good Night, Mr. Holmes," which I do encourage you to read.  If you love Sherlock Holmes, you will most assuredly enjoy Carole Nelson Douglas\'s series about Irene Adler.'
4	'Very nice book and good read.  The characters were very real.  It was very hard to put the book down.'
4	'I found this ebook very informative and interesting. I think the ebook would benefit from more pictures but there are a lot of great pics within the ebook. I think this book would be a good book for younger readers interested in sea turtles. I received this ebook free in exchange for my honest review.'
4	"Holy miscommunications Batman! And yet, unlike so many romances, these miscommunications are completely understandable. I didn't get very frustrated with the characters because everything actually made sense... I just ached for them because they'd both gone through a lot of pain to get to where they are by the time the book starts.  At first I thought I was going to end up disliking one or the other of them, but they both ended up being entirely sympathetic to me.\n\nI love that this is about an estranged married couple and that they're forced by circumstance to spend time together.  I also loved that they're both forced to grow as characters, they suffer doubts along the way and learn that they're stronger together than separately.  There were a few questions that I want answered and I wish it had been a little bit longer so that we could see how things happened once they were no longer in enforced solitude on the island together, but overall I found it a highly enjoyable read.\n\nNot a lot of heat, but plenty of sweet tender warmth."
2	'Get what you pay for with this one.'
1	'If I wanted to read about paying off debt, I would have read Suze Orman . Nothing about finding properties. Very disappointing.'
5	'If valiant could do movies they could compete with marvel and DC better. Valiant is sort of like the libertarians are to politics. The latest story arcs are better written than in the past, the graphics have improved as well.'
3	'Pretty good read, I may be rating a little low since I have read quite a few AT trail books recently.'
3	'This is a Looney string of Star Trek Jokes, told in a story.  It makes for a fun, light read for fans of silly space TV shows.'
4	"Only 4 stars so far because I've not finished reading it.  I would recommend it as a great collection."
5	'The white dragon is so cool, or make that extremely cold! Once again the author writes an outstanding book! I enjoyed it\nmore so than the previous books in this series. The white dragon has an army of white wolves and ice creatures. Diamedes,\nthe Tyniria king\'s historian returns along with his protector, the Fist of Astor. The leader of a quest called "The Hunt" survives\na battle with the white dragon, while the remainder of his party is killed. He\'s brought up on serious charges and everyone except the historian believes his group battled a dragon. Three magic users from the kingdom of Kish are involved. Plenty of\nexciting action! I\'m looking forward to book #5 in this series, due in October of 2016, which involves the most powerful of the\ndragons, the huge red dragon!'
5	'Great Great series'
5	'This is a great short story with a cliffhanger. I recommend it to any one who likes a little erotic story.'
5	'This is a great read! Very well developed characters. Highly recommended for anyone that enjoys romance!'
5	'Another great book by Natalie-Nicole Bates. I loved the book from the beginning. The details are very well written and just the right amount. A great read that will keep you very interested from the beginning. A very enjoyable short read that will not leave you unhappy.\nI was given an ARC for my honest review.'
5	"It reminds me of how I met my wife. I saw her at work, she wore this cute blue suit and I was immediately smitten! She was straight (or so she thought) and within six weeks we were seeing each other. 23 years later we're happily ever after!\n\nThe book is so well written for the lesbian genre. Very romantic and sex scenes are well done without being too graphic. Very refreshing after so many typical stories."
5	'My son and I just stumbled upon this book as we were trying to decide on a bedtime story. We read it and loved it! He told me not to delete it from my kindle because I have a tendency to delete things as soon as they are read but he said I really like that story can we keep it? And thats the best review of all!'
5	"Great book, great reader and a wonderful addition to any child's reading library. Thanks, what an excellent team of authorship, the artwork, and the editing. Thank you! I have shared this with ALL my young parents and teacher friends too!"
2	'Story was ok, had a lot of potential but was to short  and  superficial. The story made some big leaps, with no explanations. Story was set over a few days epilogue 6 months later, with a change of living conditions, job and no apparent negative feelings from her parents. At least Blake got his happy ending.'
1	"if you are going to make a case for Women's Ordination, do not use this book."
5	'I loved the book and I could not put it down. The characters came to life with their suffering, strength, bravery and love.'
5	"It is now getting good again but the whole drama with the back & forth between men gets old fast!! Dang I Don`t know why the authors think we like all that but we don't!"
5	'If you want to give God back His control over your life, and you apply the referenced Bible verses,\nyou may realize the importance for letting go and letting God. Amazing!'
4	'By the time I finished reading this narrative it was like the blinds had been raised up on a foggy window. Story after story in the media and so many other sources portraying the Great Recession outcomes - keep saying underemployment is all the fault of knowledge-less people. Its their own fault for working low-pay jobs. Here, finally is the alternative reason based on a real life experience that I have seen in so many others lives. Hard story..but wonderfully told.'
3	'A decent view on the basics of pistol shooting. Most information in this book can be found online however, its nice to have it in one book.'
4	'Book was ok but not enough action to it.  Not enough suspense to it also. If you want something fast to read this is it'
4	'Good book.  I liked the dynamic created by the origin of the characters.'
5	'Loved this book!'
3	"I'd like to give this book a '3.5' not '3' but the review world does not make that possible.\n\nDom and Zara are looking forward to an upcoming meteor shower when Dom is forced to agree to take his older brother, Elliot, along. All set for a night under the stars they head out to their optimal star gazing spot for the show of a lifetime. A meteor crashes nearby nearly taking the three out upon impact. Thankful for coming out of the ordeal alive, they move closer to investigate.\n\nAs the dust clears, they stand at the mouth of the impact crater peering down at a field of crystal shards. The sharp, crystal knives would cut any who were to touch them, and Elliot takes full advantage.\n\nDom tumbles into the crater, Zara's screams fill his ears, and everything goes black.\n\nWhen Dom mysteriously awakens, he soon finds himself falsely accused of his mothers murder, as well as attempted murder of his father and he goes on the run. Soon, he promises himself, Elliot will pay for what happened.\n\nThe story is intriguing, two brothers unexpectedly amped up with super powers and having the sibling rivalry of the century. A family torn apart, the world choosing the side of the wrong brother, love mistaken for friendship.\n\nI enjoyed the book though I felt the story was a bit rushed, many mysteries popping up all at once, alliances and organizations forming and implementing attacks within days of gaining powers, a short time to round up every new super hero still discovering their newly inherited gifts. I wanted more emotions, more time spent wallowing in self pity and remembrance at his loss before Dom rose up and became the hero the world deserved, reclaiming his innocence. With a little more detail to the emotional state of our heroes and slowing the story down a bit, Real Heroes Cry would be a great read."
2	"Too brief and much more boring than Morris' usual work."
5	"I love this series and couldn't wait to hear Carlys story. These reads have been all about family and drama and love  all the good things I crave! Carly was starting a new life for her family and was doing everything she could to leave the past behind Her career, her boys were everything and she didn't take the help from her circle of family and friends for granted. Everything was ticking along until life threw a few more curves\n\nAnd Derek Taylors curves were spectacular! A bad boy rocker was just what Carly needed  even if she didn't know it! Derek had to work hard to convince her he was good for her  that he was not just another sexy, tattooed delicious man Ahem With the hospital as a backdrop that provided even more shenanigans, they both were going to have to deal with uncertainties and unexpected challenges\n\nThere is warmth and tension circled all around this story  indeed, all the stories in this emotional series. No one is perfect, and real life rears its head at every turn, but that is its own appeal. People and situations you can empathize with make this a series I will return to again and again\n\nI cant wait for more from this author!\n\n*I voluntarily reviewed an Advanced Reader Copy of this book.*"
5	"I love Elias Zapple's books because he has a crazy sense of humour. His Book of Slugs is mad. It gives descriptions of his minions including his chef, Gino the slug, Selina, his slug lawyer and Steve, the slug who was accidentally run over by his lawnmower.\nThroughout the book there are recipes such as Slug Pie, Slug Juice and Slug Cereal. There are amusing illustrations and serious slug facts scattered here and there and at the end there's a quiz so make sure that you're paying attention as you read.\nThis is another gem from the highly imaginative Elias Zapple."
2	"This book was not helpful for me.  I was looking for ideas of what to write in books during signings. It lacks detail and advice where needed and only provides common sense information on the topics covered. The two main points were 1) don't use a fountain pen b/c takes too long to dry and may smear and 2) be careful what you write b/c other might read it.  I gave the 2nd start b/c it was only $1"
5	"Two great books together, both dealing with the choices open to the heroine, Abigail Brown. At the beginning, a woman who has never experienced an orgasm, she is pitched into a series of passionate and graphically-described bouts of love-making, and, to cap it all, has two hulks to choose from! Ann Omasta brilliantly keeps us guessing (and excited) throughout as we breathlessly follow Abigail's every move, and every twist and turn in her need to reach a decision. You must check this out."
5	"This book was so darn depressing in so many ways!  After being apart for twenty years, Maureen learns that her fiancee was NOT DEAD!!!  He had been missing in action for over a month, held captive, and when his father learned he was still alive...he didn't bother to pass this info to Maureen since he did not want her with his son!  They had a whirlwind courtship, yet neither her mother nor his father approved of their relationship.  Then she learned she was carrying his baby!  Her mother forced her to give the little girl up for adoption.\n\nThey both married, were both widowed, and soon found each other again.  Oh, but it was so heartbreaking to read how unnecessary it all was!  They could have married and had their baby together if it weren't for their parents!!!  There didn't seem to be any hope until the very end of this book.  I had to stop reading every couple of chapters just to take an emotional breather - yep, it was THAT GOOD!!!\n\nI loved seeing the three viewpoints - Maureen's, Allen's, and Heather's...I loved that Allen met Heather's fiancee in the airport, and wondered if Heather had been the flight attendant on Maureen's plane...\n\nSuch a GREAT story!  Highly recommended if you can handle the emotions associate with it..."
5	'Have I mentioned that when I see a pretty cover I always have to read the book not caring what the blurb is? No well I am now I LOVE THIS FREAKIN\' COVER! I loved this book and I just adored, yes ADORED Huntley\'s auntie, "oh nonsense! I may have gone a little overboard but it is nothing less than you deserve. Your Uncle Alex and I want you to feel at home, because as of right now this is and always will be your home. Besides, I didn\'t want you starting your first day of classes stickin\' out like a Barbie doll at a Rodeo." I loved being in Grayson\'s mind it was kinda more entertaining then being in Huntley\'s\n"she really shouldn\'t do that, I don\'t need any more reason to stare at her breasts.\nI wonder what it would be like if we had babies?\nWhoa, where the eff did that come from?"\nYeppers, more entertaining. Huntley well she\'s not one to beat around the bush about things, "then make a effing decision! I\'m not a yo-yo!" Grayson you can tell he loves his girl and will do anything for her, and seeing her happy just brings him so much joy, "her excitement over something as simple as baking cupcakes makes me smile. My girl is easy to please." He\'s just an all around great guy, has some flaws but who doesn\'t have those, he\'s a tad bit cocky, but then name one man who isn\'t, "baby, I\'ll rock your world if that\'s what it takes." Needless to say this is one book I need to have for my bookshelf.'
5	'Great read.'
3	"It didn't seem to hold my interest, but it did have a good theme."
5	'This book is really good if you like suspense.  I had no idea who the murder was until the very end.\nEnjoy!'
3	'This book was entertaining but it seemed to go on and on.  Weaving in and out of different times of the killers life that made him who he was just seemed a bit much.  You always hope for good to win over evil but there seems to be no urgency for the last child as you did t even know she was gone.  This guy is just to old to have done all this for so many years  and why the secrecy of who is "R" would have been more relevant if it saved the girl in the beginning'
5	"This book captivated me from the get go.  I loved the setting in New Zealand, fell in love with Ranger and how he so desperately wanted to give up something he loved with a passion for a chance with Ada.  The Chemistry between them is very steamy and intense.  Hated her reaction at Ranger for him wanting to help find and rescue his brother but could understand her reaction.\nHated the thought of the danger so many animals in this world are captured, used, abused and killed for ancient, unproven methods of medicinal remedies and how humans out of pure greed don't care about the repercussions of said acts and how Ada finally researched and realized the reason for Ranger being part of Bear Force.\n\nThis was my first read from Eve Hunter and Can't wait for the next book and looking forward to your future books"
4	'Pretty good.'
5	"I wasn't for sure about this book in the first 2-3 chapters but once it got going into the story I was hooked.  So then I was waiting for the big twist that all the reviews was telling about and then it happened and the ugly crying started.  Needless to say I had puffy eyes when I was done reading this.  This was the first book I have read by this author but I will definitely look up her other books now.  I would so recommend this book to all my friends.  a must read!!!"
4	'I enjoy reading this author. I will continue to purchase her books!'
4	'This was a simply written story about the innocence of a country girl and her transition into maturity. This is a "G" rated story with a good message underneath. I had originally given it only three stars for obvious out of historical context, dialogue, thoughts, etc. However, I changed to a higher rating because of the enjoyment factor and the great message to be careful judging others too quickly.'
5	'Dope short read.  Finished in 1 day and was thoroughly entertained.'
5	"I really don't know where to start. I read this book because I read several good reviews and was looking for something a little different. I was hesitant at first - I was cheated on a long time ago, and still hold a grudge, so to speak - but I'm glad I did. The pain I felt while reading it was palpable. The character development flawless. I cried with Emma...then I cried with Gavin. It was hard for me to come to the realization that someone who cheats is not always a horrible person. Sometimes people do really stupid things, make really stupid mistakes, and need to be given the opportunity to atone for their sins...but sometimes people just need to forgive, learn to love again and grow...stronger...I went through all the steps; anger, depression, denial, self loathing, longing and love again. I could definitely relate to Emma, and I could definitely feel for Gavin.\n\nI found myself laughing at their courtship...crying at their pain, hoping for their reconciliation. I found myself wanting a bouquet of freshly laundered towels. I fell in love again, and I've grown and got past...my past. I love Emma, Gavin, Yvonne and Diane. I even love Lisa - for making me realize how good I have it and how good life could be!\n\nThank you L Maretta, you've given me a reason to forgive...and finally move on.\n\nGet this book, it will tear you apart and rebuild you stronger than before... and it will make you happy for the little things in life...like towels."
1	"I didn't realize this was a adolescent humor book.  And an unfunny one at that.  I hated it from Chapter One.  The cover makes it look like it really will teach you something about publishing on Kindle and elsewhere.  Spare yourself and save your time."
5	"Damn.....Lisa knows how to drag you around with her books....Bastian and Jack are camping when the world goes to pot.....With ash falling from the sky and a run in with some bikers Bastian and Jack need to learn to survive...They get separated and what Bastian goes through whilst Jack is trying to find supplies is horrendous.....Kept hostage by the bikers with a few others he goes through hell....Jack just wants to find him......This book is so well written and you really feel for Jack and Bas and what they go through aswell as the other characters....I love Miss Henry's books and this is just another great book to add to her collection x"
5	'This book was a great easy read it shows that some people give up something very important just for fame and how that fame really becomes unimportant.'
5	"I loved this 2 part book; it was a short story. Hannah and Caitlin decided to ride with Joshua and Zach. It gave me chills when Caitlin and Zach got separated from the other two, and she thought of the ways Zach could be hurting her friend. The scariest things are the ones that can happen in real life. And four drunk people, especially of opposite sexes, can definitely end badly. My favorite line: If Zach hadn't seemed as surprised as she was by Josh's sudden exit, she would have to wonder if splitting up was their strategy all along.\n\nThe ending provided a very cool twist. Then when you think things can't get any more crazy, BAM, another cool twist. I definitely shivered after reading this-in a good way.\n\nI RECOMMEND this book to read."
4	"Not often does a book/s make me really sit back and think after reading... and this one definitely does!\n\nThis Sequel is so emotional! You will be in pain, love, anger and more while reading.\nYou feel for Jake and Kaye and the other characters and you will be an emotional wreck until the very end.\n\nThe ending of Paradise Taken is shocking.... and then you get to see the entire love story unfold from the eyes of Jake in this book.\n\nJake has always been in love with Kaye. He knows what he did was wrong to her and her family, his family/kids. Yet, he will never regret the baby he has created with Kaye. He will do anything to keep her safe and be with her if he can.\n\nThis book shows his feelings for Kaye from the very beginning and throughout the years, feelings he had about his wife, the way he and Rob met and their friendship and more... and then up to present day like.\n\nRob will be quite frustrating in this book and doesn't let anyone have an easy time at all... which makes it hard for their kids, Kaye and also Jake.\n\nBeing that both books deal with cheating it is hard to pull off a book with it, but CM does a remarkable job of having us fall in love and sympathize with everyone involved. She makes it in a way that is tasteful and full of love and not pure hate.\n\nI am being kind of vague in a sense for this review due to not wanting to spoil anything.... let me just end with saying... you will fall in love with Jake, Kaye, Claire, and all the kids. The kids are remarkable and so are a few friends in this book. Despite the deceit and lies there is true love shown and given in this book.\n\nIf you love caring, kind, compassionate, forgiving people, mixed with pain, lies, deceit, angst and more you will absolutely love this Sequel to Paradise Taken.\n\n4 emotional stars from me.\n\n***I have to say that I have contacted that author to find/learn the background behind the truth in this series... and woah! You will be floored with all the details. I want you to know that should you too like to learn about this in detail you may contact her. She is super sweet and willing to tell you all about it. All you have to do is email her or find her on FB and she will certainly chat and talk with you!"
2	'The book was vague on what new agents need to do to get started. It did give recommendations for other books'
5	"Under the Burning Sky is a fabulous book that I greatly enjoyed. My dad was in the war, so that part of the book really intereted me. And my son, Wes, is an active duty Marine, so, of course I LOVE Marines! I love how the story unfolds between Ethan and Amarin, even though the odds are stacked against them. I also liked Amarin over protective mother. I can't wait to read the next book in this series and I can't recommend it enough. Definitely a 5* book!"
5	"Alive, Alive, Alive. Love this book of Mike Evan's.  Moving and Inspiring."
5	'Really good romance novel and the characters are so real and likeable. The first book and I am moving on to the next.'
5	'great book and series I could not put the book down at all. I wish taht she had continued the series.'
5	'It was soon funny! Got a crush on the demon and a stitch from laughing.'
5	"Such an easy and enjoyable read.  I love the way the way the author writes and does not include a lot of heartache and tragedy, but rather let's you in on the way of the Amish life."
5	"All of the books in this series are great. I did not like the latest book because it was so vague and didn't really have much of the story in it. I wish the author would have shortened some of the information and added more of the story line into this book. Overall I do love this series and cannot wait for the other books."
5	"This was the first book by Carrie that I've read and I'll be looking for more by her in the future.\nI read a lot of books and Surrendered Hearts ranks at the top of my recent reads. I was drawn into the story immediately; and the characters came to life in my mind, propelling me through the story. This is a book I'll read again someday. Loved it!"
4	'As an intervention specialist of younger stuntd, I always wonder what the teen years might be like. This first an account really helped open my eyes to what might lay ahead for them.'
5	'The book is inspiring yet all over the place it would have been better structured. Overall a great read. I would recommend it'
5	"This was a great read. There was something new with each turn of the page. Pharaoh had a lot on his plate. I think that him and Honest belong together. He has some heavy decisions to make. Will it be love or will it be loyalty. Great storyline. I can't wait until part 2."
2	'The story is a good concept but not much substance.  Could have been so much better and more interesting'
5	'I have read many many daily reflection books. This is by far the most insightful, vulnerable and thought provoking of all. The openness of the authors to expose their humanness in the light of the gospel readings is powerful and inviting. This book should not only be on kindle, it deserves paper too.'
5	'Easy to read. Well written. He makes me crack up. I kept handing the book to my husband and telling him to read a paragraph. Then we would both laugh  but it was serious at  the same time.  Even if you consider a 5 K an ultra run it is still a good read  I would like to meet the author.'
4	"I was sad to see this one end. There are your typical editing errors but easy to get through and at least for me didn't take me out of the story. Characters were rich and this author made me give a damn about them. Thank you Mr. McDonald for creating a story that had a satisfying ending with closure. It leaves it open for a sequel but if there is never one it is OK because here you got a credible ending. This must be truly difficult to accomplish because so few in this genre manage to do it. This author got it right from beginning to end. Bravo."
4	'Sometimes I enjoy twisted stories and these were great. A few more would have been nice.\n\nShort and to the point'
5	"Another great love story from Melissa Foster. I love the Seaside gang. These are the types of women I would want as friends. In Seaside Dreams we get to ride along with Bella and Caden as they fall in love. Caden is a single father and has dedicated his time to his son. Starting a new relationship has its ups and downs but Bella and Caden's love for each other prevails. If your looking for a feel good love story that will make you laugh and smile one-click this today."
5	"This 2nd book to the series is just as amazing as the 1st. The story continues and throughout it all you get so very attached to all of the characters. I'm not usually one to write a review but I felt this series needs to be experienced by anyone looking for a hot, emotional, phenomenal BDSM book that actually has a story behind it."
3	'The book would have been better if he focused more on real people and life, not all the data on GM and Kellogg .  I enjoyed the science of the book but then again I am in the medical field, not a good book for lay people.'
1	'Mocking what someone else holds dear to their heart - To mock is to humiliate, ridicule, insult, revile, make fun of, deride, sneer at, scorn, or hold in contempt.\n\nJoseph Smith reminded the Saints in an epistle  to be aware of those prejudices which sometimes so strangely present themselves, and are so congenial to human nature, against our friends, neighbors, and brethren of the world, who choose to differ from us in opinion and in matters of faith. Our religion is between us and our God. Their religion is between them and their God.\n\nThere is a love from God that should be exercised toward those of our faith, who walk uprightly, which is peculiar to itself, but it is without prejudice; it also gives scope to the mind, which enables us to conduct ourselves with greater liberality towards all that are not of our faith, than what they exercise towards one another. These principles approximate nearer to the mind of God, because it is like God, or Godlike.'
4	'Great to learn and begin to know women of the Bible who did good things.'
2	'Honestly, Teasdale\'s work has become something of a guilty pleasure for me, as it consists of not-quite-erotica of a sapphic bent combined with some genuinely intriguing sci-fi (or sometimes fantasy) babble.  This book was a little more serious and had a lot of promise, but then it turned into a mess about two-thirds of the way through when the author started bouncing from one character\'s perspective to another like a kangaroo on crystal meth.  The read can go for a long time without hearing anything from Aneka or Ella while the author provides a paragraph (or sometimes a page) from the perspective of one of the many, many random secondary characters that have been introduced in the last several books.  It\'s so disjointed and spastic that it actually got annoying to read until you get to a random and kind of anti-climactic conclusion.  I think the author needs to stop going back to the "Xinti AI" well quite so often.  If there is another book in the series, this one won\'t have been enough to completely turn me away from it, but two of these in a row would spell doom for the series.'
4	"This was the first book by Mimi Jean Pamfiloff I've read and all I can really say at the moment is... WTF? But in a good way ;) When I picked up this trilogy I thought it was a contemporary. I hadn't realized it was fantasy/paranormal. It's been a while since I've read paranormal romance and this one was REALLY good! I never knew what was going to happen. The only thing I didn't really like was the regurgitation of what happened in the previous book or two books (if read in order). I think it took away from the story just a little bit. I hope we get to see Mack's hea if his book is written."
5	"I thoroughly enjoyed learning more about these great guys, who just happen to be Dragon shifters! I can't wait to read about and get to know more of this dragon clan. I hope that you Elianne have plans for many additional books for this series! Thank you for the great stories and characters, keep up the great writing! PLEASE!!!"
4	'A very short read with a totally new concept in writing which keeps the story unpredictable.  Keeps you wanting more fore sure.'
5	'Miller wrote a good book and I wanted more!  He needs to write his biography, which I think will be good as his fiction books. Please write me non fiction, author writing is very good!!!!!'
5	"Another masterpiece by Dawn Robertson. I enjoyed the cliff hanger. I am slightly worried about the lawyer guy, I don't like him one bit."
5	"This book was amazing. It definitely exceeded my expectations.\nThe moral of the story is what moved me the most.. I found hope after reading this, and it's something that will stick with me forever.\nawesome job."
5	"I'm not a big reader, so for me to pick up a book (or in this case the kindle), and read it with every spare minute and up late, until I finished it.  My 11 year old dtr read it first, and she really liked it.  So I pick it up, read the 1st chapter, and that was it, I was hooked, and I couldn't put it down. I love the characters, and I can relate to the New England area.  Growing up my mother was really into the paranormal, and witch thing (only the good witch/paranormal stuff), so there was a little connection there. It was exciting, scary, sad, adventurous, and courageous.  I highly recommend this for anyone who likes paranormal, reincarnation, good vs evil.  Well written, creative, and very imaginative : )\nDiane P"
5	"I have read and previously reviewed this book.  I love the Lei Crime Series and highly recommend any of Toby Neal's works."
4	"Omg what do you do with a life like Emily's? That is a great bucket list just like her don't know if I am able to get some of th items in the list cross. I am cheering all the way for her can not way for part two to find what happens. I enjoyed every bit of it hope part two is just as good."
5	'A nice insight into the inner workings of Buckingham Palace. Royal watchers will enjoy this.  The book is just right for length.'
5	'I absolutely adored the " Deep in Your Veins" series. Then you went and wrote the "Dark in You" series(where\'s the third one ?!?). Now you add From Rags to the list!!!! Thank you so much!! Ladies (and gents) Suzanne Wright has the best leading ladies !! These three are all different from each other, From Rags isn\'t paranormal or sci/fi! I more than enjoyed this story, it\'s a keeper.'
5	'Vanessa cargo is a wonderful spiritual writer, I love her work, this book a good example of God looking out for his children.'
5	'Very good. Could not stop readinf'
5	'The story is full of twist and turns\nSo many wonderful characters and stories with in the main story all very enjoyable'
5	'This is not a glorified romance but a story built on facts! I encourage you to read it! It will change your view of what part the white men had in the brutalizing of Native Americans!\nSo many times people rationalize why it happened and why it had to happen!\n\nThere is no rational for it! As a white Christian woman I have never, even as a young girl, understood Why white men always feel they are superior to other races of mankind!\n\nJesus was NOT WHITE!  He was a man of unknown color but of Middle Eastern origin through his mother.\n\nSorry about my soapbox moments but it is what I truly believe!\n\nPlease read this book!'
4	"for a short story this was pretty good...  there's a lot of suspense and yes there's romance. I can't wait till the second book comes out!!!! I have a feeling Jackson is either hiding Gabriella or he hired someone to kill her...."
4	'A beautiful love story about a sad English billionaire and a beautiful young woman from America  A quick read through all three books'
4	'Not a comprehensive, but this book was well worth the $4 if you are a beginner to jQuery. Has some basic examples too.'
1	"Really ridiculous fantasy about sex and what men and women want.  It should be banned, burned, gotten rid of in some way.  It's drivel."
4	'Absolutely Brilliant! Dark and Decadent!'
5	"Intelligent presentation. Detailed and thorough. Excellent essay by astrophysicist Dr. Rudy Schild (Emeritus, Harvard University) examining Suzy Hansen's experiences in light of newest scientific understanding of the physics of space travel."
5	'Misunderstandings and misplaced anger make for great makeup sex! A fun short story about a couple who belong together. Great read!'
5	'Such a wonderful book. I read 1-2 books a week & this is at the top of my favorites!!'
3	"Quiet. An easy read. A nice quick romance. Not my usual read and I hate to only give three stars but I would have loved a little more excitement. I haven't given up on North yet!"
4	"Wow, if I had to describe the book in just one word I would say: FASCINATING!\nDaddy Dearest felt like watching a movie, a very good suspense film where every new chapter brought a different surprise. You keep reading and reading, waiting for the outcome and you never see what's coming.\n\nPaul wrote an excellent book where every detail of the plot is well thought. The father's personality is solid and believable and you get into his head to discovered an underworld beneath the real world. Every character provides something to the story and each one has a past, which makes it more complete.\n\nI don't want to say much about the story because I would be ruining it for you. If psychological thriller is something you enjoy, you MUST read this book.\n\n*** I received a complimentary copy in exchange for an honest review. ***"
5	'Excellent book covering the great commanders of the Roman Empire. Good mix of politics of the time influencing decisions of commanders.'
5	"I loved this book. Fascinating the way author went back in time to the present. I couldn't put this book down."
5	'This was a great read'
3	"It's a good quick read and probably an enticing hook into the series for most people, but I just can't get past all the errors. A decent editor would have given it the polish it needs to really shine. I enjoyed the story but am not tempted to read any more by this author -- like Cam's presentation, it's simply riddled with too many issues. I also found it hard to believe that Cam would be willing to overlook how brutally Chase had cut him down (in public, no less) just because he said he had potential. Well, this author has potential too, but they need to learn basic sentence structure."
3	"This book about dogs is pretty entertaining, and should catch the attention of most young readers, with some caveats.\n\nThe title (Dogs Around The World) implies that there will be at least a little information related to geography, or even different breeds of dogs, but neither happen to be present in this book. All of the facts are about dogs in general.\n\nA good third of the information in this book is closer to speculation and opinion than it is to fact. However, for the intended audience of this book, I don't think thats a large problem, but it is something that could be discussed. For instance, An unsupervised dog will get bored in a back yard very quickly. It is never safe to leave your dog unattended in the yard. Um ok, apparently Ive been doing it wrong all these years. Well trained dogs, given something constructive to do in the yard, are absolutely safe to leave unattended. Im sure the idea behind this statement is to warn against neglect and the imprisonment of dogs in a yard, which can also mean a lot of things.\n\nPage 7 concerns me slightly. I probably would have chosen a different picture. At first glance, its a girl hugging a dog, perfectly innocent and beautiful. However, looking more closely, that girl appears to be unclothed, with a rather large bruise on her abdomen Maybe Im interpreting the picture incorrectly (it could be her knee, even though that seems unlikely), but thats what I see\n\nOverall, this is not a bad book, but it could be better. It should still serve to entertain and inform, to some degree, young readers.\n\nDisclaimer: I received this ebook in exchange for my honest review."
3	'I was hoping for more of the story to take place while underway aboard the sailboat.  This would have helped develop the characters.'
5	"DANG! Antonia is such a meek character but she just makes you love her. I felt a sense of protection for her as a reader. I'm sure that's why Jah found himself wanting to help her as much as she could. They are a very cute couple. I love the way Jah respects her, doesn't allow anyone to DISRESPECT her, and the way he lets his guard down to be the man she needs. Great Job Author!"
5	'Love this series!'
5	"I have a five year old that is just getting into computer and video games. Since I grew up on Mario Bros and Tetris, I am overwhelmed by the options out there these days. It's hard to know easily which ones are appropriate, safe and not too expensive. This book is a great easy guide to the Moshi Monster world for parents. It addresses everything a parent would want to know about what there kid is playing without getting into the parent-useless details. I loved that it was easy and quick to read and understand. Definitely worth a look for any parent with kids who like games."
5	'Monica hit a bullseye with this one.  I found it extremely interesting and factual.  Anyone interested in the political arena should read this one.'
4	"The REAL best seller has yet to be written.  That's the one which will link the Mafia directly to the Vatican and exposed the billions covered up in money laundering.  The Mafia scared Ratzinger--that's for sure."
1	'I would not recommend this to anyone. I will not buy anymore books from this author either. Readers should beware!'
4	"This was my first ever Abigail Barnette novel and I was delighted it is well-written, but surprised it is a May/December novel.  The heroine is the heros junior by 24 years. That made me pause. But the more I read, the more I liked it, and I forgot the age difference. The main and secondary characters, the pacing, the chemistry, the tension, the overall storyline are all really well done.  I like both the hero and the heroine and cant fault them. And if you are looking for a steamy romance, youll get it here.\n\nThis is not a standalone and I didn't know it going in. Thats my fault because I didn't research.  Its one of six, (yes SIX novels SO FAR) not including a prequel novella.  I don't know that I have the stamina for that many books about one couple, but here, the build-up to the cliffhanger and the cliffhanger itself was expertly done and my heart is currently aching wondering how the heroine and hero will handle the next stage of their lives. I'm looking forward to the second book.\n\nMy recommendation is: if you can get over the age difference, navigate through the sexual athleticism, and the fact of the cliffhanger ending, youll enjoy this novel.\n\nI liked this authors writing so much I looked for some stand-alones/shorter series to read and found plenty I can choose from."
5	"If you like the high heel mysteries by Gemma Halliday then u will love these too!! Great books full of mystery, comedy and romance very well written!! I am so glad I found this author's books and I am anxiously awaiting the next books from her!!"
1	"Really disappointed in this book. Sure is an easy read as its so simpleminded. Don't waste your money. Past books by the author were much better."
5	'Great book to go along with Stone Guardian.'
5	'Such an encouraging story and written so well. I had a hard time putting it down.'
5	'excellent book wish they would write more in this series. I could not put it down until I was finished reading it...Wonderful book'
2	'I received this from Library Thing to read and review. This is another short article and probably not worth the price asked for it.  It provides some good information and can be a good starting point.  I found the text, though short, dragging as I read. I kept waiting for the section to end, a good sign that the material was not reaching me.  After reading it, I am not so sure that I have really learned how to improve my memory or concentration. The seventeen steps were interesting but not all that earth shattering. I kept waiting for some aha moment, as I read them, that never did happen.'
5	'I recommend this book, a paradigm shift.'
4	'I had read Dan\'s first 2 books and knew this one would be very different. I must admit after the first chapter I was thinking "Oh Boy" this book is not for me. But I stayed with it and boy am I glad I did. Buy it for your kids and then read it yourself when they are done. A book the whole family can enjoy.  Great story!'
5	"Ms Norwood simply gets better and better at writing erotica, and always with a human twist. I enjoyed the protagonist of this short from the fist time I met her and as the story progressed found myself rooting for her & laughing happily when she emerges triumphant! The characters aren't given a lot of time but manage to show depth where needed. This is definitely worth a read!"
5	'Incredibly long, ultimately fulfilling journey which was written where one wants to identify with the main character in all her trials and tribulations.'
5	"This is a quick read, and I don't want to give anything away.\n\nThe relationship between Smoking Hot Fireman Seth and Worldly Yet Innocent Eden was intense! I loved that despite Eden's inexperience she was a grown woman who went after what she wanted.  I also loved that Eden's best quality, her loyalty, was nearly her downfall.\n\nThe intimate encounters between Seth and Eden were fraught with dark emotion. I ached for him, for both of them. Also, an alpha attitude with a desperate desire to claim HIS woman...yum.\n\nThe HEA came rather quickly, but the novella format requires it... ultimately it was extremely gratifying.\n\nI will absolutely be reading more from these two authors."
5	"I cannot even put into words how truly amazing this series is but I'll try.  Antonio and Theresa's story kind of just infiltrates your body and stays there. Here I am months later after reading their story and I still think of them obsessively.  You just feel their story it soaks into the mind and body while reading and you feel their adventure, their passion and fear throughout the whole series. They share a chemistry that ignites you over and over again and just when you think there's no more Antonio pulls another spade on you. I seriously loved the ink on every single one of these pages of this book.  Honestly get you some Capo and Contessa (Antonio and Theresa) you will not be disappointed."
5	"Bomb my favorite author! Don't sleep on Clever!"
5	"This is my first time reading this author's work and I am blown away. It chronicles Sky and Mark's story and is a m/m romance. It is an interracial relationship that deals with suicide, cultural differences among other things.\n\nSky and Mark were roommates in college where their love story started. Mark's Korean background and his brother's suicide played a major role in his reluctance to fully commit to the relationship; even though he was in love. Sky had no reservation but was hurt before and just couldn't understand Mark's reservation.\n\nThe story takes the reader from their teenage years to adulthood ten years later when they ran into each other. The author is a great story teller and had me totally invested in their story and eventual HEA."

4	"I absolutely LOVE the Shadow Falls series and was pleased to find this short story about Della for free. It is a great insight into Della's life and helped me understand why she reacts the way she does to some situations. I highly recommend all the novels in this series to everyone that hasn't read them yet. They grab your attention from page one and they do not let you go! I finished book 4 last night and am on the edge of my seat for book 5 to come out in Spring 2013."
1	"I love books about Bigfoot.  This book may have Bigfoot in it, but it is not about Bigfoot.  It is a number of disparate ideas that are never truly tied together.  The author rushes toward an ending that is a total train wreck.  I wouldn't recommend this story to anyone except lovers of Mad Magazine!"
5	"Frugaling is smart, thoughtful, and inspiring.  Through this book and his blog frugaling.org Sam has inspired me to be a better, more frugal person.  Excellent read!  I can't recommend this book, and message, highly enough!"

4	"Shelly Hickman writes so beautifully and fluidly that reading her novel is a joy. And it is about time women starting waiting about menopause and how it affects women and the people in their lives. I think a lot of people will relate to this story. It is very sweet. I think it would make a great film. Listen up Hollywood. Menopausal women love to go to movies. We would love to spend 90 minutes with Shelly's characters and all that nice air conditioning."
5	"Love, love, love reading Oliver Tidy. He's a master storyteller and writer. In addition to the RomneyMarsh series (British police procedural), I've also read and loved his Acer Samson series (international espionage). I couldn't believe that they were written by the same author as the two genres require such different writing styles and tones. Yet Mr. Tidy totally succeeds flawlessly  at both."
5	'it is the type of book that keeps you attentive because you know there is more to the sister than meets the eye.'
5	'Wonderfully written as always! Ever get that feeling that there is just no one out there for you, well Slade is in that position. Sometimes we just have to remember that if we try to rush things even with the wrong person we will miss out on who fate has for us, luckily Slade he finds his mate\nI was given a free ARC copy of this story in exchange for an honest review'
2	'It is not as fast as early Clancy books.  It is a bit pedantic at times.  It is ok for a long flight, but not a great read.'

5	'Great sci-fi novel. Highly recommend to anyone who likes the sci-fi genre.'
5	'A new way of making changes one micro step at a time. Calls for nothing drastic but for those with patience, it can be rewarding to follow the steps in this book. If u r looking for a quick fix, this is not for u.'
4	"Just a bit confused as to when in the timelines of these particular Doctors this happens. Twelve is still super duper grumpy, so this must be a Season 8 Twelve. It's easy to guess Ten, since he has a new companion we know nothing about, so this is 2009 Specials Ten. Eleven? I guess he's Mid-Season 7, between losing the Ponds and meeting Clara. But for Eleven, I thought he was being super moody and grumpy in between, so I feel that Eleven was a mischaracterization. I also felt Twelve was even grumpier than Season 8.\n\nAll that aside, it was a proper meet-up for the Twelfth, especially after the glorious 50th. Plus I love how Ten and Eleven found Twelve in utter fear and disgust because *spoilers*."
5	"Love the details and examples given. I totally will use this report as a how-to guide in my dating life. So I'll be prepared when the Time comes tochoose the one for me.

4	'Full Disclosure... I know Tom Pfeifer and have seen him develop as a speaker in Toastmasters.  From a shy, hesitant, faltering voice, he now commands the stage whenever he delivers a talk.  I had not previously read anything of his, even though I knew he was a professional writer.  Now I have.  Write it, Speak it, is full of salient thoughts about the process of creating and delivering a speech.  It is a breezy read, devoid of any blather, which is illuminating to anyone who wants to become a better speech maker..

5	"These essays, notes, and speeches about her craft and the world of science fiction and fantasy, written with her trademark humor and clarity, cover thirty years of work.  Some have been published elsewhere, but much is new and allow glimpses into the author's mind from the beginning of her writing career to today.  I'm always interested in the nuts and bolts of writing and in the background of a favorite author, so I thoroughly enjoyed Sidelines"

5	'The Great Gatsby is often lionized, even by academics who know better, as a romantic celebration of the American Dream, but it is equally, if not more so, a critique of corruption during the Roaring Twenties\' run-up to the Great Depression. And how a twenty-six-year-old alcoholic college dropout could pull this off so masterfully is nothing short of genius.\n\nCorruption symbols abound in this novel. The valley of ashes appears in every chapter, mentioned eight times outright and poetically invoked more than fifty with terminology such as "wash," "dust" and "powder." Six more if references to Nick\'s Finnish housemaid are counted. Fitzgerald did alliterative back flips to remind us of ashes. The god-like judging eyes of Dr. Eckleburg and the owl-eyed man are mentioned no less than nine times. Crime boss Meyer Wolfsheim\'s name comes up thirty-two times, and Al Capone\'s then headquarters, Chicago, twenty.\n\nThe main characters are all adulterers. Tom Buchanan has an affair with Myrtle Wilson. Tom\'s wife, Daisy, has an affair with Gatsby. Nick, the narrator and Daisy\'s cousin, enables Daisy and Gatsby\'s affair and has a gay tryst with McKee while dating her friend Jordan Baker, a professional golfer who habitually lies, cheats at golf and is a careless driver. The only honest character is Michaelis, the Wilsons\' cafe proprietor neighbor. George Wilson is honorable until, driven insane by grief, he guns down Gatsby in his pool for running over Myrtle in his Rolls and failing to stop. Both Michaelis and George saw a man driving, but Nick believes "gorgeous" Gatsby\'s lie about Daisy driving.\n\nFirst bootlegging, then securities fraud, Gatsby\'s criminal enterprises reek of corruption. He even tries to recruit Nick to sell his worthless bonds. Adultery, wrecking a marriage and lying about who was driving are just part of the package. Gatsby is rejected by Daisy not because of his social class but because he was a criminal. His execution by Wilson is the righteous result of that very same corruption--a bullet from George for running down Myrtle. At the end, Gatsby stunk so badly only a handful of people came to his funeral, not even the ungrateful Wolfsheim, who "made him."\n\nMany readers idolize Gatsby for his determined pursuit of the dream to be a millionaire and reclaim Daisy. Yes, Gatsby dreamed of riches, but his helium-filled ambitions were evident long before he met her. Did he love? Maybe. In Nick\'s naive romantically charged mind he did. But how much do we trust Nick\'s judgment after he fawned over Gatsby, calling him "gorgeous," and swallowed his lies about  family wealth and being educated at Oxford? For all we know, Daisys just a trophy, like the castle and the Rolls.\n\nAs if to obliterate any remaining doubt as to his message in The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald alludes in the final jaded line to the Jazz Age\'s current of corruption: So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past. Yes, we keep repeating the same mistakes. Ivan Boesky. Bernard Madoff. There have been dozens like them. In the Twenties it was counterfeit bonds. More recently, sub-prime mortgages and credit default swaps. What will tomorrow bring? We can pursue dreams, but it is a morally bankrupt grail if we are corrupted in the process.\n\nUnwilling or unable to face the broader implications of this magnificent social critique, the incurious will be transfixed by Gatsby\'s capacity for romantic imagination. Maybe it is the novel\'s dark warning they shrink from. Or maybe they\'ve been misled by Bloom\'s Guides: The Great Gatsby, a rag of literary misinformation which could have been written by someone bent on keeping the trusting public naive about Wall Street shenanigans.\n\nBut even an exorcist conjuring the ghost of Homer could not suppress the fuller message of this apex novella that encapsulates so well the American condition.'

5	'Youll like this book if: Gypsy Beach (#1) pulled you in, and youve been dreaming of more Gypsy magic ever since! (Gypsy Love can also be read as a standalone, but is even more enjoyable having read the first installment beforehand.)\n\nTHE STORY: Arley Copelands life is in shambles. Her writing career is flailing, her personal relationships have crumbled, and her hometown has turned their backs on her. Needing an escape, Arley decides on a road trip to Gypsy Beach, and a stay at the local Gypsy Inn. (Run by none other than Sienna and Ryan from Gypsy Beach #1!!!! Yay!)\n\nAlso arriving for a stay at the Inn is jaded divorce lawyer John Rowan. Even though neither guest is looking for a commitment, the sparks start to fly, immediately and undeniably, between these two souls. Looks like Gypsy magic has struck again!\n\nMY THOUGHTS: I cant even tell you how many people ask me for a good summer book to get lost in. I LOVE it when I have an answer to knock their socks off- even more so, when its a delicious SERIES of books to keep us charged up all summer! The Gypsy Beach series by amazing Jillian Neal is exactly that- its steamy HOT, heartwarmingly romantic, and full of spunk. I cant get enough. Im slightly obsessed, actually. Ive even changed up my wardrobe this summer to a free-flowing, sassy Gypsy style. I know. But what can I say? These books are just THAT much fun.\n\nAlright, now lets delve in deeper.\n\nA few pages into the book, an Im already met with this very truthful and spot- on, simple quote. The potency of fiction was awe- inspiring. Such a modest statement, yet so exceedingly accurate! Think about it. A solid books power to pull the reader in and transport us to another world is intoxicatingly potent unparalleled, even. And the absolute reality for this Gypsy series. Not many books conquer this feat, us true blue readers can testify. But the ones that do, literally rock us. That, is exactly how I feel after reading Gypsy Love.\n\nWhile totally romantic, hot, erotic, and naughty. theres something much more important at the heart of this lovely story. Something weve all dealt with in one way or another, the one thing that should NOT continually be disregarded by so many. Acceptance. Loving one another despite our differences, and showing not just tolerance but TRUE heart- felt love to each and every person on this earth. Race, background, religion, or in Arleys case, career, none of it matters. Loving our neighbor, our community, a complete stranger for that matter- this is what matters folks. Acceptance and love is the tie that binds. Thankfully in this story, we got to witness Arleys brokenness be overcome, and for her to rise above and flourish, even. So beautiful. And so well written into the storyline.\n\nAs you can tell from my above sentiments, the character development in this book is so completely thorough, we have the opportunity to really get inside these individual personas, and actually feel them. This is such an important experience for the reader, to feel the person and the book come to life and explode from the pages. Also provided was stunning imagery for their surroundings, which only heightened the feel of the overall book. It allowed John and Arley to be front and center (first and foremost!), yet also provided an exciting backdrop for the story to unfold. It just doesnt get any better than this!\n\nEach of us readers has our own ideal recipe that makes up our perfect book. Mine is a character- driven story where the protagonist(s) shows strength and confidence to follow their own heart. To be free, and to let love in. To take risk, enjoy life, and chart your own path. A coastal setting is also a huge plus. In short, Gypsy Love was filled with all my favorite ingredients and then some.\n\nMy hats off to you, Jillian Neal!'

5	'Funny and sexy story. Will be a good read'
4	'Great story line'
3	'I am trying to be fair in my review of "Father of Two", because I really enjoyed the largest part of the story, but there were several episodes within the story that turned me off completely because I felt they were overly graphic for their explicit sexual content. Otherwise I would have given this book a 5-star rating.  Two or three episodes turned me off to the point that I have put Miss Arnold on my AVOID list so I will not be buying any of her books from now on. I loved most of the banter among the characters, but I am left with a particularly disgusting vivid memory of the detailed account of a horrifying oral sexual assault. I wish I could erase that memory forever, but unfortunately it will take some time. I hope that, in the future, books containing explicit sexual scenes are labeled so readers can avoid them like the plague.'

Kristie does an amazing job of keeping me drawn into her world every story and this was no different. Can't wait for the next one!"
4	"The recipes in this book look very inviting and I intend to try some of them. However, the book is short as recipe books go. Also, I almost NEVER buy a cookbook on my kindle because it is so hard to turn to the recipe you want. I just couldn't find this one in another format. Otherwise, very tempting looking meat free recipes."
5	'I especially like the format of this book.  The stories are wonderful.  They encourage and challenge me to step it up in my Christian walk.  I have listened to Eastview Christian Church weekly sermons on iTunes for years.  The book is a great read.  Thanks for putting this together.'

5	'When I was in my early 30\'s, I started having pain radiating down my left buttock. I remember wondering how on earth I had managed to sprain my butt.  I looked in a home medical book and diagnosed myself (correctly) as having sciatica.  Being without insurance at the time, I followed the self-help suggestions in the book and I have continued to look for others through the years.  I have gradually evolved a regimen of techniques ranging from how I sleep, stand, and sit to nightly stretches.  I guess you could say that I have been successful, since I have managed to remain pretty much pain free for decades without resorting to surgery or pain medication.\n\nBut I always wondered why there were so many different methods of self-treatment and why some worked for me and some didn\'t.  Turns out that "sciatica" isn\'t really a diagnosis, but a description of a set of symptoms.  Different problems may be causing those symptoms, which is why some treatments may work for you and others not.  Understanding that basic fact clears up many of the things that have puzzled me during all the years that I have dealt with sciatica.\n\nLast month I read this author\'s excellent book on chronic neck pain (NECK CHECK) and learned so much from it.  Now he\'s written this book which addresses my second problem area.  Is he reading my mind or am I simply a very typical Baby Boomer dealing with the effects of ageing?  Probably Door #2.\n\nThis author is a well-credentialed and experienced physical therapist, but the value of his books lies not in what he knows, but in his talent to explain complicated medical information in terms that the rest of us can understand without being intimidated or overwhelmed.  He describes the anatomy of the back and how the sciatic nerve can become the victim of accidents and/or ageing. He explains the importance of getting an accurate diagnosis of the cause of your sciatica and what that may entail.  He gives a list of "Red Flag" symptoms that require immediate medical intervention, although most of his advice involves self-help techniques\n\nHe discusses ways to alleviate the pain of a sciatica flare-up while the body heals itself and you can start to make changes to prevent another flare-up.  He talks about the danger of sitting and the value of cardiovascular exercise to help you recover from a flare-up. The first I was all too aware of, but the second really surprised me.  He even shows you some simple methods to use traction to give your damaged spine some temporary relief.\n\nHe shows stretching exercises that help alleviate the pain and "core strengthening" exercises to give you a stronger body that can support your weight and take some of the pressure off of your lower spine.  I can tell you from decades of experience, these exercises WORK if you will do them regularly.\n\nThis is all the information I wish had been available to me many years ago and it\'s in a readable, easy-to-understand format.  You are your own best doctor, which is why the best medical outcomes happen when the patient is educated and involved.  If you suffer from lower back pain, you owe it to yourself and your family to read this book.'
5	'This book is a wonderful, interesting read. I am reading for the second time and still am surprised how much I still enjoy being in the story with the characters. You will loose yourself in this book. Great read!!!'
5	'The game is very simple classic Snake, nothing extra fancy just simple plain fun. Worth the 99 cents for a game that I haven\'t been able to play without "extras" since my first Nokia cell phone.'
5	"Wow!  I cannot wait for book 4 to be released!  Please write fast Karen, you are an amazing author!  I couldn't put book 3 down, there was so much action, suspense and talk about leaving me hanging at the end!"
5	"Coming from a person who doesn't like reading, this book was incredibly addicting. It kept you wondering what was going to happen next and because of that I read it in 3 days (when I woke up each morning). Amazing ending and amazing suspense built in"
2	'Very little useful information. Mostly just general concepts to gardening and very repetitive. Other than how to make good dirt, no other details.'
5	"I'm truly appreciate Blue Saffire and these excellent series in which I'm reading. I'm almost done and I can't wait to get started on the next chapter"
5	"I assumed this book was going to have tests available for me to determine in my home if I was bipolar or not. It had links that lead to tests to take and that's not what I was looking for. However, it was informative and gave me a pretty good idea what bipolar looked like. I received this ebook free in exchange for my honest opinion ."
5	'Such a well written series! In love with this series. It is most definitely worth a read. Get your tissues ready! Such a heartfelt story!'
2	"I usually don't write a review but I had to write one for this book. I found the book to be confusing. Right from the beginning I found myself going back to the page I just read because the next page went to a totally different idea. Example: The book went to when Lilah and Rex meeting at the jail to all of a sudden they were seeing each other and having an affair.  There seemed to be a lot of pages missing. This book to say the least was one of the most disappointing books I have read so far. The story would have been interesting if you could follow it!"
5	"A fresh, clever take on a dystopian, apocalyptic world. Robbins focuses less (so far) on the What Happened and more on our main character, letting the reader settle in to Chris's warped and drug-addled take on humanity and its demise. It's a weird--and refreshing--concept, to have a hero's not quite as disturbed about the eradication of most of the populace as we'd expect.\n\nThe prose is fast-paced and generously spliced with humor. A good start and I'm looking forward to the next book."
5	"I follow The Guardians Of Eternity series. It is exciting! Levet is a breath of fresh air and keeps those Guardians on their toes. I enjoyed Levet's novella and it gave insight in to other characters that I am excited to learn more about. I am looking forward to the next book in this wonderful series!"
5	'I enjoyed this well written mystery. Good plot. Great characters.'
3	"Fast read, cute mystery.  I rated it three stars, but that doesn't mean I didn't like it. I save four or five star ratings for gripping novels that really pull me in. This was not one of them, but it was fine."
5	'waiting for book 5...excited...love the series'
5	'I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this book.  I found it to be very well written for a first novel.  The characters were amazingly complex and interesting and I found myself caught up in the suspense.  I really enjoyed the "Austinesque" plot with the Bengali twist.  What a great matriarchal character to be scheming behinds the scenes to see her children settled in marriage.  I  highly recommend this book and hope this author writes another novel.'
5	'Little women is a classic for good reason. It has filled me with joy again as always. And I shall be reading it to my grandchildren.'
5	'Happy Ending for All!! This is the end of the series and I enjoyed every bit of it! True love can prevail... just takes a little bit of work! Yes!! 5 Star Hit!!'
5	'I cryed, laught and totally enjoyed the Christmas read!  Her books put you in another world to escape to and seem so real.'

5	"Absolutely loved this book!! Rylee is such a strong character and deserves to be happy.  The book was hard to put down and I can't wait for the next one in the series.  The writing was fantastic! :)"
5	"Oh, man. I didn't think I'd love this book as much I did. I've read so many books involving rich girls who want a taste of the bad side. They're all the same and it becomes a snoozefest. RWYA was nothing like those books. This hit me in all the right places and I LOVED it. It was emotional and inspiring. It's about two helpless people who's worlds collide and become something greater than they've ever expected.\n\nAvery is your average rich girl that most people will assume has everything she's ever wanted. But she doesn't. She's living a life other people chose for her. Some people will hate Avery throughout the book but that's how we (the reader) will see her grow. After catching her boyfriend cheating on her, she goes cray cray and smashes his car. The only way to get out of that mess without going to jail is 300 hours of community service.\n\nSeth is the bad boy with a heart of gold. He went to prison for trying to protect his sister. Anyone who puts others before themselves are my kind of people. I adored him on the spot and his best friend, Ryan. Seth and Avery start off disliking each other after a hot and steamy night gone wrong. As they continue being around each other, their hearts start to get involved.\n\nI need more of these characters. This book was perfect. I highly recommend it. <3\n\nComplimentary copy provided by the author/publisher via Netgalley in exchange for an honest review"
5	"I'm no doubt biased since I not only know the author, but I live in Fort Worth where this takes place. I know the area, the restaurants mentioned (some sadly since closed). Still If it weren't well written, I wouldn't be able to get through it. I could hardly put it down.\n\nAlter brings the Fairmount and Ryan Place areas of Fort Worth to life while her protagonist investigates a death. Kelly, a divorced mother of two, and a realtor, just can't seem to keep her nose out of the detectives' way when a skeleton is found in a house she's renovating to sell. She won't even stop when her own house is vandalized. Are the two linked? Read and find out!"
4	"This book has taught me a lot about bitcoin mining for a beginner. I am so happy I found this book. The author teaches you step by step and how to get started and what you need. I highly recommend this book and I can't wait to get started using all of these techniques that Johnny has described in this book!"
5	'A breath-taking romp through the sometimes ugly world of creating beautiful sights and sounds.  Art and artifice abound on-stage and off with characters so deftly limned that one can only say "brava!"'
3	"It was okay. I do recommend reading this book. I did laugh a lot it was really funny but that's my opinion."
5	'It is like stepping into the past worlds in the deserts. Good will always triumph over evil. The entire series is unbelievable.'
5	"Love all of these books. Can't wait till more come out!\nVery fast and clean reading! Great storyline.\nHighly recommend."
4	'Enjoyed the story, especially how well you included the cats in a realistic way. I have two cats my husband and I enjoy watching more than TV (no commercials !) Which is also why we enjoy reading, too. Story is too short, is my biggest disgruntled. Blessings.'
5	"Verified purchase con Amazon.co.uk\n\nOnce I started reading Irrefutable Proof I thought it was another Dan Brown-ish novel. I am so happy that it wasn't, as Ms Vandiver overcame my expectations.\n\nI really enjoyed how the author managed to picture her characters - for example the archaeologist Justin, who recalled me a bit of Indiana Jones and a bit of Daniel Pierce of Perception TV series. I also loved the plot and subplots twisting in a vertigo of events and some action.\n\nAlthough it was the second book of the series and I didn't read the first, I found easy to catch up with everything. I never found myself out of the story, which is an awesome strength point to Ms. Vandiver's writing style.\n\nMost of the mystery stories don't embed any messages behind the lines, but Irrefutable Proof has some sparks to meditate about mankind, where we came from etc. I found that pretty interesting even though I usually enjoy mystery stories as they are.\n\nIrrefutable Proof has elements mutated from several genres: suspense, cozy, sci-fi, adventure. It's a great versatile book I'd recommend to everyone."
5	'easy to read'
3	'I like some of the ideas here and it really gets the creative juices flowing but still seems like the stragies may be a bit questionable especially when folks may be looking to qualify for a new mortgage but will still be holding their own note.  I would think the new bank considering financing would see all of the outs on the subject to or land contract and deny new financing to that home owner.'
4	'I always. Enjoy John grisham books'
5	'Jay, Annie, and other contributors share inspiring stories of courage and nuggets of wisdom that provide motivation and mindset vision for readers to turn whatever circumstance they may be facing in their life around. A great read!'
4	'I received the first five books free by joining on another website. I thoroughly enjoyed reading them although I got the impression that each of the books was very short. I am not a huge fan of the very short books as opposed to just writing the stories into one longer book. This sixth book  confirms that for me. And it looks like the 7th one is the same way. Although I understand that the Kindle pricing is very inexpensive for books I would prefer to pay five or $6 or even $10 to get a four to five hundred page book then to pay $3 apiece for 140 page books.\n\nThat whole complaint aside, that is really the only complaint I have with the story. The editing is great. The story is original. The characters are enjoyable and the whole plot is engulfing. So with all my complaints aside I look forward to jumping right into the next book and continuing the story. Wish the last one and the next few were already available in a compilation!'
5	'Friends warned me not to use romanization to read Korean and after going through this book, I can see why. It teaches romanization but warns against it, and when it takes only 60 minutes (I did it in 48 minutes) why bother?'
5	"Dhalgren is one of my favorite books of all time, one of the most intelligently written.  It plays on reader's expectations in ways that no book before had done.  This summary proved interesting."
5	"This series has changed immensely since book 1. I never would have guessed at the story arc. At first it seemed like a fun sci-fi romp, typical space opera, then everything started twisting, and these major moral concepts started entering the story.  By book 4 it was craziness, and 5 was all over the place, and I could not see where things were going.  Book 6 pulls it all together, answers the question, and blew my mind.  About a third of the way through 6, I was feeling very emotional about the characters, and it made me think a lot about my life and the world I live in.  This is a rare feat for a sci-fi series these days,  and I love this book for it. It is one thing to be affected by the death of a character in a  novel, but to be more affected by the life and universe of a character in a literary achievement.  I can't wait for Scott's next book!"
5	'Great book'
5	"Reading this book felt like I was hanging out with my girlfriends. The situations were relatable and entertaining. The gossip girl inside of me couldn't get enough! I love the playfulness and borderline inappropriateness within their friendships. Entertaining, fast, light read that leaves you feeling good."
3	'This is a bundle with two books.\n\nI just finished book 1 in the bundle and thought I would review it, although I think I will probably feel identical about book 2 as book 1, because I feel pretty much the same as I did after reading the prequel, but who knows?\n\nIn the beginning of book 1 there is an awkward introduction of the time travel premise.  I felt the reaction of the Welch group was very odd and the reaction of Anna and David was also odd.  Odd=not natural.  I think that is what I meant before in my review of the prequel when I wrote that I gave up a lot for the time travel premise.  However, I have read a lot of time travel books where I did not have to "give up anything" in order to swallow the time travel concept.  So I decided as I read the same awkward "stuff" in this book as in the last that it was an awkwardness in writing that was the problem.  Once one gets past the awkward "hey, we are here from the future" part of the book, it is like the story settles down and gets somewhat better.\n\nI have never felt this way about a book before (I should say series of books since I feel the same as I did after reading the prequel).  Let me explain.  I scan-read, meaning I feel the writing is wordy.  The primary characters are not fully developed. Well, in this book David gets a lot of attention and I like him as a character but everyone else seems to be just cardboard cutouts and I have trouble liking them enough to really care a lot about them.  I think this is particularly true about the character of Anna who shows up so much in the story but is not three dimensional to me. It is also true of the reappearing mother of Anna and David who I felt pretty neutral about coming out of the prequel and that feeling has continuing into this book, and it is true of Llywelyn who I liked best in the prequel but now, reduced to a cardboard cutout of his former character, is not as interesting this go-round.  However, the story line or plotline seems to just hook me and compel me to keep reading. It is like I dislike AND like the books at the same time.  It is that combination I refer to when I say I do not recall feeling like this about another book/series before. I inexplicably bought the prequel AND this bundle at the same time.  Maybe I would have stopped after the prequel--given time for reflection--if I hadn\'t owned the bundle.  Truly, I might not read book 2 but for the fact that I already own it in the bundle.  On the one hand, I am curious where the author goes now that the "history" is clearly departing from what it would have been if the time travelors had not arrived--twice--and changed history. On the other hand, I am not as hooked as I was after the prequel so my commitment currently extends to reading on through book 2, for better or for worse.\n\nOkay, so what do I know?! The second book in the bundle was much smoother (not awkward) and better written than the previous two books.  Some little issues but overall so much better for me. Are these Young Adult fiction? They seem like it.  Now I need to read book 3.\n\nI would rate the first book in the bundle two stars and the second three stars. This averages 2.5 stars so in the "generosity" of the moment I will give it 3 stars.'
5	"I like this book it's imagination through the words makes u want to read more. To all the go getting hustlers give the book a try, I think you'll like it."
4	"This was short, but a very good holiday read.\n\nAshley is from San Diego and has house swapped Oliver, who lives in London.  Ashley has this idea of a perfect Christmas.  One that she shared with her mother prior to her mother's death and London seems like the perfect location - snow, decorations, old architecture and hot chocolate.  She ends up there alone because her roommates, who were going to accompany her, cancelled.  Oliver never gets out of London because the airport has closed due to the weather.  He returns home and falls naked in to bed...  On top of Ashley (she managed to arrive on one of the last flights the airport allowed to land before closing).\n\nOllie and Ashley click immediately.  Ashley longs for someone with which to celebrate the holiday.  And Ollie wants to avoid the holiday any way he can.  He has a lot of emotional baggage and doesn't ever want anyone to rely on him again.  But, he can't help how attracted he is to Ashley and they end up spending lots of time together.\n\nIt's a very sweet romance.  Ollie was pretty great and Ashley was very likable."
5	'I really enjoyed this meditation guide. I have a somewhat stressful lifestyle and I was really looking for something to take the edge off and make me stress-free. I picked up this meditation guide up because a friend recommended it to me. I was at first not so into it, however when I started to read this book I found myself more and more into meditation and yoga and integrating them into my everyday life.'
5	"This book was clear, easy to follow and encouraging.  It gave me a new perspective about how God communicates with us. I have been frustrated for years wondering why I never hear from God.  I realize now that I haven't been paying attention!  Thank you so much Tanya!"
4	"A highly enjoyable read- It wasn't my first book by the author and hopefully won't be my last- Characters have personality- Carefully edited so it doesn't have lots of typos- Read from start to finish,  not willing or wanting to stop until I was finished-"
5	"What great chemistry!! Amalie and Jarrod are so stinking hot!! I LOVE baseball so this was the icing on the cake for me. It renews my faith in HEAs.\nAmalie has a crappy past that doesn't want to die or stay dead. Her family basically sucks and her best friend is trash! She finally finds solace and safety in the arms of the sexiest baseball player I think I've ever heard of!!\nJarrod is all that AND a bag of chips!  He restores her faith in love and humans in general. We meet some great supporting characters that will likely have great stories of their own!!!\nThe only thing that would have made this book better was if he pitched for the St. Louis Cardinals! (Sorry Hayley, I bleed Cardinal red!!!)\nGreat new author for me! I will be adding her to my TBR lists!"
5	"From strength to strength in all aspects of the author's/artist's work. Nice to see the author maintaining his curious Britishness too. It's a laugh on every page and hard to put down too. And the artwork is so rich and intriguing too. Love it!"
5	"Loved it! Ian Tennent is amazing at transporting you to a place you've never been. I always feel that I can really see what all is happening. Such a great way to experience an awesome story"
5	"Sassy girls, suspenseful plot with a lot of heart.  I thought it was just great fun to read. I honestly wasn't sure if I would like it, this isn't my usual genre  - but  I did like it!  I highly recommend this book.  A great way to end the summer..."
5	'A must have for all genealogists researching Massachusetts ancestors.'
5	'Kept my interest and was enjoyable throughout. Looks like a new writer has joined the ranks of the "famous".'
5	"If you like fun plot lines, and fast paced action, this is your next buy! It's also clean for those looking for great thrills without the sex or language. As the characters keep getting in and out of sticky situations, the heart will continue to pound, and the suspense build, to know how they will get out of their next predicament. Well done! Looking forward to the next book."
4	'I really loved Wasted, the first book in this series, and I enjoyed this book as well. This story is like a slow burning fire, it will sweep you up in flames you just have to wait for it. Hawk is a gentleman through and through and his character is established right away. I really like this series and am looking forward to the next book.'
5	"A friend told me about this book, but I was a little skeptical at first. Secrets to happiness? Come on! But I was wrong. I'm a pretty happy person overall but I tend to get too involved in day-to-day problems, whine a little, and forget about what is really important. This book helped me refocus on the right priorities AND provided short meditation-style exercises to stay happy and to appreciate life more. Definitely five stars!"
5	'This book is amazing!  If you are new to Christianity it is a must read!  If you are skeptical or even downright resentful of Christianity it is worth the read as well.  Sara Miles is an exceptional writer and her story of "conversion" is remarkable.  I couldn\'t put it down.  She is not a right-wing conservative Christian by any stretch of the imagination.  She understands the true message of Christ (in my humble opinion) and does a remarkable job conveying that message in this narrative about her her own journey to Christ and her mission to feed the hungry.'
4	"Lily is an independent woman that doesn't care to be ordered around. She met sexy Derek several years before but married his best friend when the passion they shared scared her. Derek is a devil-may-care spy that has been in love with Lily and helping her from afar!\nWhen they go on Iditarod race and danger of a different kind starts, Derek sticks close to Lily. Lots of romance and playing hard to get enhanced with the entertainment of silly dogs and dry humor!"
5	'Mark Twain has a way of writing that keeps the reader interested without going on and on.'
3	"I couldn't get really interested in this book so I quit after the second book."
5	'Kindle, quick download'
5	"I don't normally read western stories.  But I sure am glad I did.  I was hooked by the very first page.  I found the characters believeable.  I really enjoyed the action. I liked the how some historial facts of thepast were weaved into the story.  I highly recommend this story.  I enjoyed it so much that I purchased the next story, 'Her Wild Texas Heart'."
3	'It is a shame the writer is releasing basically a Chapter per month.\n\nThe story is good, but a year to read it is too long.'
5	"An exciting page turner of a time traveling science fiction thriller that explores the future evolution of the human mind, with a smattering of global politics, romance, sex and rock and roll. If you like Asimov or Wyndham's social science fiction or you just want a thrilling sci fi  adventure Joski's novel is a good read. I would really like to see this on the big screen, lets hope Hollywood picks it up.\n\nIt was fun hanging out with Joski's characters.\n\nI wonder what gigs I would go to if I were a slower probably would include Bach and Hendrix."
3	'A short but intense novel.  Follows the last story beautifully.  Should have been a little longer and got more into the sister suffering.g.'
5	"This was a wonderful book from beginning to end. I love the African setting, it's unusual and interesting. The characters have great life stories and good reasons for all they do. I enjoyed getting to know them and it was a pleasure to share a slice of their lives. But mostly, I appreciated this writer's skill and her ability to tell a lovely story so richly. Very well done. I'd recommend this book to anyone--from teenagers on up."
4	'Seemed to be well thought out plot with smooth flow of action and characters.'
5	"God's love is so amazing, this book shows it perfectly. Good read, especially for a new person coming to Christ."
4	"Good book to walk you through getting over your fear if you have no idea where to start (or don't want to). This book recommends a gradual exposure approach to overcoming your fear."
2	"This book is missing page numbers, therefore you can't find recipes easily. Lacking in content."
5	'Very interesting to learn about the different toxins and the effects they have on our bodies. Definitely a good book to read. Lots of information!'
5	"a wonderful story for the wonderful Harriet, I've so much wanted to know her story, find out how she became the owner of a mail order bride business and if she would get her happy ending....she's a loyal, caring, generous woman who always has others best interest at heart, but she has a heart breaking tale that has left her scarred and afraid....it was so wonderful to finally learn about Harriet, I smiled and cried with sadness and joy at her tale, we all know a woman like Harriet, I think this might be my favourite BOB book"
1	"I didn't even finish this book that's how much I hated it stop. It swears every other word stop. Has some places that are boring stop. I wouldn't recommend  this book to anyone stop. Can't believe there are two more books in the series stop. I would think they would suck also stop. Sorry about the stops stop. I'm am writing it like a telegram thing stop. Ok so don't read this book stop. Kay bye stop."
5	'E. R. Mason has a laid back style of writing that starts slow and then captures the reader.  His writing style and story telling are such that he should have been published by  a major publisher.  In addition, his books are inexpensive.\n\nMy biggest regret is that he has not yet developed any further stories around this character.'
5	'Five stars for a book I could not put down. Cause of the genre I wanted to read it. But was unexpected of the roller coaster ride it would take me on. Was fun to read and the story unfolded like a tv movie. You could easily picture what was going on from the start\n Only thing I felt was amiss was what ended up happening to Jess. Anyone who enjoys rom coms will not be disapointed.'
5	"This was a great story. The storyline kept me interested. Jax is bae all day. Lol. I couldn't stand Juan. Than boy was beyond dirty. How can you claim to love someone and hurt them all at the same time. He really had problems. He lost a good woman when Cam left him. He didn't deserve her. Jax was always there for her and will continue no matter what. He loves Cam unconditionally. They have a bond that can't be broken. I can't wait until book two because that ending makes me wish I could reach through the book and slap a few people!"
4	'Great read.  kept you reading no matter what chapter you are on. The book had something for everyone. From fight sense to love chapters'
4	'Good ideas.  Need a little more character development. Definitely needs some proof reading.  Looking forward to the next book in the series.'
5	"Virgina Woolf's writing talents are superbly displayed.  She grants us a splendid view of the world of the psychotic.  Her abilty to  create characters and emotional realms is unequalled.  If you love fine writing, you will read all of her work."
5	"This was one of the best stories I ver read!\nTotally recommended to read !!!\nCharacters were wonderful along with a great story line.\nJackson found his true mate and handled his nightmares!\nChloe found her brother and true love .\nGreat read!!\nCan't wait to read more!!!!!"
4	'best book ever very interesting too excited'
5	'Not just a love story.  This was so unique in the way Mac and Kate meet; the crazy connection they share.\n\nI wanted to strangle Mac for the devastation his dishonesty caused them both.\n\nA beautiful story that was worth the tears.'
5	"One of the best zombie stories that I've ever read, and I've literally read hundreds. I didn't put this down until I was finished with it. By the end I was sobbing uncontrollably. If the Apocalypse ever does come, I hope I'm as brave as John Miller!!!  I would give this story 10 stars if I could!!!!"
5	'When I first read this book, I honestly failed to note that it was a spoof, but I really enjoyed it; it\'s a fun, funny read that really made me laugh. The hero, Brock Fullman was a delightful hero, the heroine, Stephanie Write is a dear heroine and Marci, the hero\'s fiancee, well, she was comic relief, though, honestly, I cringe when I read Marci calling Brock, "Brockie,". Other than that, I love the story; it makes me laugh and brightens even my darkest days. If you need a good laugh after a rough day, I suggest giving CCBNS a try. Thank you for a good read and a good deal of laughs, Luke, hope to read another of your works soon.'
4	'This is the last of the Faro series avaliable on kindle...not happy. Anyway this book was an enjoyable read though the spelling and grammatical errors were very annoying, wouldn\'t take much for these to be fixed. The book was quite good but there were some glaring clues that were "missed" initially and knowing Faro through the books it was very out of character and stupid. Apart from these few gripes I still enjoyed it and recommend it for Faro readers or those who enjoy a who done it set in Victorian times.'
2	'I thought this book was excellent.  I would have liked a little more description of the people and the places though to bring it more to life. I would have liked not more in the ending. Over all the storyline was great. I would recommend this book; for people who like romance and western s. Oh l forgot,  I would have liked to have more about God in the story not just a mere mention.'
5	"Think so far liked this one best.  Liked Alex cause she wanted to be different.  Tell a story and nothing was getting in her way. Lazarus was so big and so bad that the women were to scared to be around him.  Not Alex..  She was his other half just didn't know it and loved their kidding each other.."
5	"All I can say is OH. MY. GOD! Tasha Ivey really knows how to mess with your head in the best way possible!  After reading Every Breath I knew how things were going to turn out for Callie and Wes, however, I was still holding my breath wondering what was going to happen for half of this book! If that is not the sign of a good book, then I don't know what is!\n\nI hated Wes in this book.  And then I fell in love with him.  And then my heart broke for him (over and over).  Especially knowing that all of the crap that happened to him in this book wouldn't even compare to the pain and loss that his future holds with the loss of his brother (and best friend), Shane.  But at the core, all of the things that I hated him about him also made me love him more.  In the end, he was struggling and broken and just didn't know it.\n\nI LOVED getting to know Callie and Makenna better too.  Their friendship is one to be reckoned with!  I loved seeing the interactions between them, and I especially liked seeing how they dealt with their conflicts.  I was envious of Callie's ability to speak her mind, no matter the situation.  While Mak's innocence and pure love was so refreshing.\n\nThis book as as good as Every Breath, and I CAN NOT WAIT for Every Glance coming out in 2014!!!"
5	'A very lucky Valentine, man am I ever jealous!'
2	"This is a novella so it's short. I felt the story should have been more complex for these characters and so this novella did not work for me. Because of it's length story was rushed and very underdeveloped. In the end it came across as implausible and unrealistic."
5	'Good western short story.  Interesting enough that I look forward to another chapter/saga.  Characters and situations are interesting and while there is action and gun play, it is not over done.'
5	'Kudos. Well written series that kept me wanting more.'
5	'Like all her other books this one is no different, quick and easy to read, good story plot and it keeps you wanting to turn the next page.'
5	'This book is great for those kindergarteners. Helps with extra practice ideas . my boys just love it. So do I'
2	'Clearly a freshman effort.  Slow to start and lots of editing errors along with unconventional sentence structure that only adds difficulty to following the plot.  Atmospherics are completely missing and might make a significant difference to a space opera as this book attempts.  Had great difficulty in finishing the book.  The only reason I finished is that I had committed so much of my time to it--just stubborn, not enticed by the story.'

5	"Quite a good collection. The sci-fi and fantasy stories mix well with traditional western, weird western, and steampunk. Enough of each to recommend to a fan of any of those genres, but blended enough that if you don't like steampunk or westerns you still may very well enjoy this one.\n\nScarabs From Afar (Jennifer Brozek), Day of the Dead (David Lee Summers), and Rainmaker (Sam Kepfield)"

5	'Scholars and commentators tend to describe this marvelous and fantastical epic as loose, primitive and unrefined. Their reasons range from a sense of Homer lacking purpose, to a worldview where gods and humans are more or less the same, to the nonjudgmental way in which Homer depicts violence, and to the more colloquial, "huddled around the bonfire" style of Homer\'s art. All of these comments have merit, but as a exploration of the human condition, it\'s hard to beat this poem.\n\nEverything\'s here: chest-pounding conquest, trembling cowardice, the angst of contrition, the sting of revenge, the importance of human relations, and all of Greek civilization on a rampage in search of beloved Helen, gold and pride. It\'s a masterpiece of raw and unapologetic scope, yet the detailing is subtle and the message sublime: when Athena whispers in a character\'s ear, we sense she\'s a psychological projection and, we fear, nothing more.\n\nI think that\'s what made Robert Fagles\'s raw, inspired and effective translation so satisfying for me, because the text shattered many of the myths--our myths--about who these ancients were, what they wanted and how they placed themselves in the greater cosmos. In the heat of battle, a bird sign might be as much scoffed at and ignored as obeyed; the motives of its interpreter might be questioned; men fighting for honor and kingdom might sooner flee than face a superior opponent unless a comrade rallies his spirit; and everything in this sordid epic is viewed as if under a microscope of pathos, skepticism and shared experience.\n\nI didn\'t miss Homer\'s rhyme and meter in this translation because the story itself is so artful; in fact, an attempt to rhyme this fluid story would pose the serious risk of detracting from its immediacy and impact. Later Greeks presented The Iliad as a national epic that valued honor, courage and glory above all things, but in Homer\'s language I find something far more textured and real. No, the ancient Greeks and Trojans depicted here are not savages in search of bloodlust and treasure; they are us, albeit stripped of faade and breeding, and as poetry, Homer suggests a Shakespearean understanding of character, fate, challenge and predicament.\n\nMy Titles\n<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Shadow-Fields/dp/1419645498/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Shadow Fields</a>\n<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Snooker-Glen/dp/1419649256/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Snooker Glen</a>\n<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Dasha/dp/1419655817/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Dasha</a>'

5	"I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I too travel annually, and am always looking for any new ways of doing it cheaper.  Kristie provides an easy to read and actual examples, but she also emphasizes how important it is to do research and develop the correct mind set for traveling.  People often ask me how I can afford to travel each year.  The answer is what Kristie presents.  I think in the future I'll give them this ebook and say, here, she says it all, just pay attention and you too can travel.  So if you want to travel and learn some ways to manage it, read this work.\nGloria"
5	"Sooo, tall, dark and handsome bounty hunter meets the beautiful redheaded daughter of his next fugitive bail jumper and is intrigued by her.  He tries to resist his attraction for her, causing her to think he isn't interested in her.  Lots of crossed wires and a strong, fast-growing attraction develops between them.  At the eleventh hour all hell breaks lose in a surprising ending.  Excellent read with an extremely low number of editing mistakes, which is a real turn off for me when reading.  I was given a copy of this book for free for an honest review."

2	"The story line of the book was pretty good, and I liked the main characters, but, the book wasn't finished!!!!!  There was NO ending.  Oh, they said I love you and lets get married on practically the last page, but please, finish the story, have an epilogue at least.  If these characters fell into the next book, then that's different, but what I read for the beginning of the next book, it was about another brother.  So, for me, no more books from this author.  I can't stand books without endings!!!"
5	"I was lucky to.receive a ARC copy and could.wait to read it. Ross did not fail. I love Alex and Jennifer's relationship as well as their extended family. Can't wait to see what happens in volume 3."
5	'"The Reunion" is a fun-to-read \'Who Done It?\'  that kept me guessing until the end. I\'m pretty sure I suspected every character at some point in time, and the closer I got to the final chapters, the faster I read because I had to know who was behind the murders.  The author kept my attention throughout the book, and never once let up on the suspense. Thank you, Suzanne Rossi!'
3	'This was an interesting, sometimes creepy, view of the sometimes voices we all hear. An eye opener on the view of abortion.'
5	"Enjoyed this book. The story of Hanna and Alex was amazing. Unexpected  adventure, constant hope to escape the cruelty of the queen and then her unexpected kindness. The nemesis, Xavier, was a shock at end when he brutally killed the queen and showed up at Alex's home. My question is will we find out about Jo?"
4	'Suffers from the same attempt at a plot twist as all teen angst novels: Someone has a deep, dark secret that is just too terrible to tell their closest friends, so they keep it to themselves and make everyone around them miserable.  So they disappear only to find that letting everyone in to help was the only way to solve the problem.'
5	'Dr. Harry Jay brings us our hero again in this series that follows Joshua who has previously routed out the evil agency called \'Forgiveness\' and is now called on by his government to explore new evil that may be coming from the same evil seed.  Joshua is a complex individual. A much decorated Vietman Vet who has fought his own private demons as well as very public demons that are out to destroy his family.  Dr. Jay wants us to look deeper into Joshua\'s Psyche and understand that what motivates him is more complicated than just "Hero Destroys Evil".  What drives him, what drives his wife and now what drives his son are as much a part of this story as the actual plot and you end up thinking about these people when your mind strays at work, in the car of as you are drifting off to sleep.'
4	"This was definitely a unique book. The thought that you're going crazy, because things like this just don't happen is exactly what I would think if I were in Emily's shoes. Strange things happening all around her. This book is full of the unexpected happening. From Emily trying to figure out who and what she is, to Asher and his sizzling hotness and how they react to each other. Then there's all the action. Fantastic! Ketley does a great job with this book, and I can't wait to see what's in store next. 4 1/2 stars.\n\nI was given a copy of this book in return for an honest review."
5	"I really enjoyed these short stories - in fact, I could definitely see a few of them being fleshed out into really great books. Like the first story, Patient Z, it would be really interesting to see what happens to her, where she goes, who she encounters, etc. And I feel the same for the stories, Jessie and Ella and Mo. These were my favorites out of the 5 stories. Definitely worth reading the collection and I know I'll be rereading it...."
5	'I enjoyed this story very much. My family is developed policemen and my love of the kitties complete my fondness of reading these Nancy Davis books. . Keep them coming.'
5	"I could not put this book down. It was nonstop action for me and I can't wait to read about the brother Dragan."
4	'Good read.'
3	"Diana H. Myers--- I loved this short story. It was a real Christmas love story. I only had one major problem with it. I believe a short story should be all inclusive. The story should be complete. This short story left questions-- the biggest was, who are Grace 's parents. She mentions seeing them someday. There was never a mention where we could read more about Grace. None of the Kindle books listed mention Grace. I really want to read her whole story. If there is a book out there about Grace or one to be written, I apologize for stars I gave it."
3	'It was ok'
3	"This was a really different P&P in that Elizabeth was the daughter of Mr Bennet's elder Brother. When he died Mr Bennet raised her with his own 4 daughters.  In this story Elizabeth really does have connections and does have a hefty dowery; so Mr Darcy doesn't so much as have to dismiss her as to have to convince her to marry him.  Elizabeth has a lot on her plate and she seems to command everyone's attention.  As for her impertanance in this story it's more that she has a plan and will not divert from that plan no matter what.  This can make her seem a little whiny at times but there it is.  The title of the book comes from the fact that Elizabeth has an extrodinary voice and she sings a unique sad ballad and she is noted for it.\n\nNow the reason I've on given this story 3 stars is that the story seems to be just a little flat and even a little boring in places. The writer does try to put a little angst in but it was not developed enough to quite frankly satify me."
3	'Cute for a short read on a rainy day. Wish it was longer but I enjoyed the storyline none the less'
5	'I do believe in the saying that "no man is an island". Every day of our life must have a companion to teach us, to coach us, or to guide us. This book is an excellent book especially for someone who wants to be successful in life. Life coaching is an important role in every individual\'s life like me. It is such a nice book to be with.'
5	'An awesome and enjoyable quick read. I really loved when he mutilated the poor snowman for a story idea. This was such an adorable story! I would love to read more by this author.'
2	'Looks like a sophomore attempt. I find it to be a poorly Photoshop edited photo-shoot. The model is beautiful, but the photography and chorography is average at best.'
4	'Really enjoyed the series.'
5	'Love the series'

5	'During full retirement from the Navy, I have enjoyed reading many novels that were hard to put down once started. Grisham, Brown, Patterson, Clancy, etc. are some of the better known story-tellers that I have enjoyed.\n\nRecently, Dr. Bruce Bowman\'s novel "The Flanagan Option" kept me glued to the pages as the realities of a rapidly developing current world order mixing of religion, terrorism, deception, romance and faith generated a solid story with a surprising ending. On reflection, I note that the author also left a subtle path for a possible sequel to this compelling novel.\n\nFor me, "The Flanagan Option" has been a great read.\nRichard L.Thompson, Rear Admiral USN (Ret)\n\n<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/The-Flanagan-Option/dp/B003R0LWMA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">The Flanagan Option</a>'
4	'I read a couple of stories about Zeppi to my niece and she always enjoyed them. That\'s why I decided to pick this book up. Fortunately, it didn\'t disappoint! This time Zeppi the Penguin went to a dinosaur muzeum. The author was able to grab and keep my niece\'s attention.

5	'I love the idea of kids getting to know Hanukkah a little better.\nRachel is doing a fantastic job in writing with exact amount of history facts among with plenty of activity, games and fun in it.'
5	'I knew by the title that this was a superhero tale, but as I got into it I realized it had elements of urban drama, fantasy, and satire. It doesnt fit neatly into any genre, which made reading it an adventure because I was never quite sure what to expect. The writing is skillful and energetic, with good dialogue and descriptions. The story unfolds as stream of conscious narrative by the protagonist, a snarky dude who seems at first like an ordinary middle-class guy who lives at home with his parents and wife, has self-confidence issues and a troubled marriage. Not so ordinary, he can fly and has latent telepathic abilities which allow him to experience events from the viewpoint of others. Hes also a dipsomaniac whose superhero powers are heightened by alcohol intake, the reverse of how Kryptonite affects Superman. Want to fly? Have a drink first. The plot is fairly simple, but not predictable, bouncing from psychologists office to bar to telepathic experiences to flight to confrontations with bad guys. Unlike the average superhero, this one doesnt win every fight, and you get the sense that hes not the smartest guy in the room, but he is well-intentioned. This was a fun read, recommended to readers of an adventurous spirit.'
4	'I believe this was science fiction writer Hal Clement\'s final book, and it was a good one. True to his unique approach to sci-fi, Clement has given us one final world where the rules of physics and chemistry which we take so for granted on earth are subtly different due to differences of gravity, heat, and other fascinating variables. He always had fun working out how human beings -- and others --always rational and well-intentioned creatures, would solve the physical problems such worlds set them. In "Noise," humans deal with a water world to interesting and instructive effect. As usual with Clement, expect no sex, violence or destruction, but anticipate an interesting journey all the same.'
5	"This is a collection of unusual, but wonderfully imaginative fairy tales.  Many are twists of traditional fairy tales, such as the Tormented Frog which looks at the story of princesses kissing frogs from the frog's point of view.  Well worth reading to adults or children."
5	"This is a good multi series . Can't wait for next book. Meet author at Texas renaissance festival great person to speak with. Books are a must read!"
4	"Funny, farcical and at times fantastical, this biting satire of our broken political system takes no prisoners. Radical conservatives, spineless liberals and a slathering media machine are taken to their extremes in this novel, but what makes Steinman's satire so effective is the thread of logical (and terrifyingly authentic) evolution of the extremes into the mainstream. For example, it is not a far leap from our current disfunction to the hysterical showdown (literally) on the House floor in EMH.\n\nThere may not be too many sympathetic or likable characters in the book, but there is much to like in this impressive first novel by Steinman."
5	'I thought I would read a story or two, but then I just kept going. It takes a special author to bring these little scenes to life with a satisfying conclusion in so few words. I have gained a new appreciation of the short story.'
5	"Looks like we have a promising new author in C.J. Oakley! Bryn Morgan is a smart and totally believable character who doesn't panic when she finds herself in tight places. This is an entertaining story that drew me in within the first few pages. Written for children, it's not a long story, but it flows smoothly and keeps you turning the pages. You don't have to be a kid to enjoy this tale and the cliff-hanger ending has me looking forward eagerly to the next book."
5	"This book was amazing, from the forward to the end. I had read a few reviews and decided I was truly interested in reading this young man's life story. Even though I didn't always understand some of his terminology, I was still captured by his courage and the fact he continued to write his story while terminally ill. He maintained an unbelievable spirit through all his trials and tribulations, as did his family. In spite of the fact I struggled with some of the terminology I would still highly recommend the book. It certainly captured my heart."
5	'This book is so much fun! As a young creative person I love being crafty during my free time and I learned so many new things from this book! Definitely recommended, especially as a gift for young adults that love to be creative.'
5	"I really enjoyed this book, a story realistic, I couldn't put the book down, and had some twists to it.\nLoved the 2 main characters"
5	"Interesting, factual, and enlightening, the author takes a real-life approach to a serious disease. Having a loved one with Alzheimer's can be a challenge, but reading this proves you are not alone. This small book packs a wallop offering tools and stories to help you cope. Well written."
5	'Love the characters and how they were able to grow in this story. I am looking forward to the next book as well.'
5	'Loved the characters and the action...I am a sucker for a happy ending but this should be a new beginning for Ametsapolis!'

3	'I was surprised at the ending of this book, did not expect those turn of events.\n\nThe characters were ok, maybe not as developed as I would have liked, but this is a first book and it can only go up from there.'
2	'Modern paranormal, she was rescued from vampires who enslaved her for food but otherwise treared her well (no rape, good food, luxury). She is living with werewolves, hating all vampires when she meets her two mystically destined mates. The wolf she is good with but being bitten is a non-starter.\n\nNice idea but the author did not know where to go with it. Bite issue resolves by magic, no real climax to the book, and it just meanders into a random ending.\n\nLots of erotica but you have to be okay with her being cut (I kid you not, cut) as erotic for all of them. Total turn off for me.\n\nThe vampire is dominant. The werewolf is suppoosed to be but after the intro turns submissive.'
3	'I followed the strategy to begin with but found myself not having the self control to keep it up, I ended up going to my strategy of get a win that puts you over what you put into the machine than go to the next one. I left with about a 20 dollar profit. I did use minimum bets each time. The cheapest penny machines I found in Arizona are 40 cent bets.'
5	'This tidbit of cold-war horror will give you a chill that will not go away.  There may not be another book that brought the realities of nuclear annihilation home like this one.  The added horror it brings is in an awareness of what "collateral damage" now means to the world.  We would not be ending ourselves but taking everybody with us.  The idea of limited nuclear war is ludicrous for readers of this monumental book that defined a generation.'
5	'Loved this, waiting for another from his perspective.'
5	'She found love without having to look for it.\n\nGreat narrative that shows that love is the way to redemption.'
4	'This is a nice murder story, in the Agatha Christie style, but "nice" doesn\'t translate here into boring. Scott puts her dashing detective smack in the middle of a strange galaxy of characters that leave him amused and, at timers, baffled -- but not so confused that he doesn\'t ultimately solve the crime. A fun read.'

5	'We met cupid in the original story. He has helped Rhiannon and Ilar fall in love...not only does that make him mad but the King of the Lycans...King Larus lets everyone in their realm know about it. He is forbidden to bring an enchanted woman back. However, nobody said anything about bringing over unenchanted ones. He finds 2 sisters...each as "hideous" as the next...at least according to cupid. Lady Mina and Lady Sophia are starving and their castle is crumbling around there feet. Their father and anyone who knows them is dead....killed by their King.\n\nThis time Cupid enchants Kind Larus but it didn\'t go according to plan and he only enchants one of the sisters in to falling for him. Again I could not stop laughing. Sibling rivalry, mis-communication and typical alpha male...afraid to tell the woman he loves he is a king..makes it a page turner.\n\nreceived a free copy for an honest review'
5	'Wow, this book personifies the things that I value in a cookbook;  Original recipes, fantastic professional food photography and recipes that even a novice can do and not be intimidated by.\n\nOne of my pet peeves in short cookbooks is the utter lack of photography.  This book has great photography.  For example the pic of the finished product is done with a macro lense (for up close photography) that features BOKEH (means the background is blurred and the pic of the food jumps out in sharp focus) and the pics of the ingredients are all in sharp focus.  This is PERFECT food photography so if you plan on writing a cookbook, study this photography and duplicate it.\n\nMany women have not had any cooking instructions and these recipes are all super simple so that even the most novice cook is not threatened by them and yet the finished product looks professional instead of amateurish and even an accomplished cook would be proud to serve these great looking desserts.  The first rule of cooking is to make it LOOK GOOD.\n\nKudos maam and outstanding job and priced just right at the retail price.  I hope that it becomes to be the best seller that it deserves to be.'
3	'Caitlin Kelly is a good narrator for this book. I found this story to be so,so. It is very heavy on over reaching descriptions of everyone and every thing. I did not like the main character or her friends. She seemed like a High School girl in a womans body. The storyline,Lacy has to go to work for her grandfather. She is in debt and needs a car,so,she does,not really knowing what his business was. Supposed humor ensues.\nThis audiobook was provided to me at no cost for a fair and honest review'
4	'love the characters in this book series. Each is distinctive and real. Great suspenseful storyline as well. Definitely would recommend.'
5	"I don't know how this book passed me. I real ALL of Xavier Neal's books.\n\nThis book was great. How could it not be? With the exception of one book.. ..(yes one book and I emailed her and she answered my question) all of her descriptive words, you can close your eyes and see what she writes.\n\nAnything, Already Written was a fun read. A happily ever after book that took relationship work to fulfill. Love takes work. I hope you enjoy it as much as I."
3	'Unbound is the second book in Kate Douglas\'s "Demon Lovers" erotic short story series. Just like the first book its riddled with obnoxious sex scenes(male/male/female, male/female, and this time demon/female.) I won\'t take away, the storyline is there and the sex doesn\'t take away from it too bad even with only about 50 pages to get it all in. Really though, that turns out to be the books biggest quirk. You have 10 chapters, 50 pages guiding you through a 24 hour period which means with 3 sex scenes in there it leaves little to no room for any kind of action. I won\'t lie, the action is there, but it isn\'t heart pounding. Really, this book is more of a drama while book one was more action packed and through it all i can\'t understand why she couldn\'t just bulk these books into one big novel. Don\'t get me wrong, its great for a quick read but for $.99 a book through the kindle, by the time you paid to read all 5 books so far your getting 250 pages for $5 when you can find a 350 page novel for $3.99. You do the math. If the quality was a little better(watch for the typos which are found in both the first and second books respectably), maybe paying it would sit easier. As it is, I\'ll keep reading them because they are quite addicting(possibly due to the cliff hangers) but i\'m using them as a bridge between other books because they are so quick and work well for a slight break before indulging in another full length novel. These are my thoughts, take them as you may. For a quicky, entertaining read, these books are worth giving a shot.'
5	'I really liked the story, the characters and the down home southern feel.  I think any romance reader would love this story.'
5	'I enjoyed this book and would recommend it to a JA fan.'
5	'Pretty good, very cute and quaint. Actually interested in 2nd chapter. Insert nine more words of filler here, thank you.'

5	'Excellent source book for improving your marriage.'
5	"The Bridal Hunt is a fun read!  I love when you can tell that the author had as much fun penning the book as you did reading it. The MC heroine is our only POV and her humorous, self-depreciating, doesn't-suffer-fools mentality sets the tone for the entire story.  Me personally, I loved her.  Her wit turns the entire circumstance of the story (kidnapped by Abominable Snowmen) into a fun ride.  This is NOT a dark tale where we get mired down in psyche, which I think is a nice addition the genre because there still needs to be light, fun stories.  Her leading men (this is RH) strike the balance of being sweet, manly, and sexy.  Their besotted devotion to her had me crushing on them so hard.  Definitely recommend."
5	"Who  but Mike Daunt would dare to risk death in order to find a fallen duck on the wrong side of the Berlin wall?\nDaunt's confessional with outlandish tales remind us that individuals with strong character are the stuff of life....\nRecommended reading for those who resist the grey tide of conformity."
5	'Eager to start the next book in this series. It starts out fairly slow then ramps up close to the end. Then she leaves you on a cliffhanger.. Ohhh the horror! But Aeden and Heidi are awesome! I would definitely recommend this book to my friends!'
5	'Another amazing story in this mm contemporary book series. I love this world and characters. Love is a hard fought for emotion. Ill read more from this series and author.'

4	'This book is sweet.  The story takes place in 1934 during the middle of the Great Depression.  It is interesting to note how different the times where - a telephone would have made a difference in this story.  I am not religious, but the references to God in this story were not overpowering at all.'
1	"Absolutely awful. The male character really winds me up. He only notices the heroine after she loses weight then we're meant to just follow a stereotypical chauvinistic storyline. Uuuhh no thank you!"

5	'Marvelous story encompassing love, loss and the complications of family.  Daly has lost her beloved father to cancer and her mother to grief, she has no friends and only works on her art portfolio to get into art school.  Laine, Dalys mother, throws herself into work since losing her husband and spends her other time reading and pushing her daughter away because she reminds so much of her husband.  Through work Meghann (a pregnant teen with a heartbreak of her own) comes into their life and changes it in unimaginable ways.  At the same time Kashi comes into Dalys life and teaches her to believe in fate and love and transforms her into the strong and giving person she was always meant to be.  But life is not always happily ever after and there are many bumps for Daly to navigate, from his parents disapproval, the damaged relationship with her mother, and loss of loved ones.  How Daly trudges on through this journey was an inspirational (if teary) enjoyment. Highly recommend it!\n**this book received in exchange for an honest review**'

4	"This is the final season in the z series and it was good as a z book but the ending just didn't do it for me. Don't get me wrong I still liked the book hence the 4 stars but I felt that the book needed to be longer and since it is the last book in the seriesit should have followed a different schedule of releases to ensure that it is longer and as much detail is packed in and all of the question are answered. Overall a good book but I wouldn't way it was the best way to end the series. The end to yesterday's gone better not let me down either because that's what got me into these guys. Maybe they have mastered the ability to tell a story but have not mastered the ability to end one. Since it's the first finished series I hope they read this and it lets them know that they need to step up their game."
5	'I really liked this book. The only complaint I have is I wish it was longer.'
5	'Inspirationally challenging, leading to look again at my evangelical perceptions and ask what room do I need to make at the metaphorical table those who truly know Christ, but know him differently than I do?'

5	'Its real intressting reading keeps my imaginasion real good going.  Al hookt up by  The boots.'
4	'ove in the Details is nothing less than what I expect from a Becky Wade story  the characters are endearing, and its easy to root for them the entire time. She realistically portrays two people who were once in a relationship, meeting again after many years and different roads of life. Its a genuinely sweet story that had me smiling while reading because they are just such likeable people. I appreciated the cautious, realistic way that they began to reconnect with one another  their reconnection doesnt move too fast, nor does it drag, but rather it strikes the perfect balance with the length of the story. I also liked getting a peek into Hollys writer life  Im sure the author pulls from personal experience there, so it was fun to read about that.\n\nI received a complimentary copy of this novella, which I chose to review. This is my honest opinion.'
5	"I have yet to read a JT Edson book I didn't like! They are fairly quick reads, fun and fast enough to be a pleasant diversion on a cold dreary day, when you are warm, inside! Bought the 4 books of the series before reading any of them."
5	'This compelling collection of stories will make you wince, laugh, think, and wonder. Unexpected twists arise as each one explores a different aspect of the human soul. Every good story should leave you wanting more, and I had these characters on my mind long after the book was finished. An entertaining and thoughtful debut by Mark Belisle that indicates the beginning of an illustrious literary career and promises even more intriguing tales to come.'
4	'When one finds it hard to find the words to pray you can look through this book and most times find what you want'
5	"I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  Martha is a great character and I look forward to the next in what I hope is a long series.  She's a complex character and it seemed like there were enough hints left unanswered that I felt there has to be another book.  I'm so glad to see that there will be.  The story moved at a good pace with enough twists and turns to make it interesting and exciting.\nMy only qualm about the book is that the fisherman part of the story seemed a bit awkward and unfinished.  If given the option, I might take off a little for that but, still, this is clearly more than a 4 star book.  I recommend it and will gladly pre-order the next one as soon as available'"
4	'Worth the time to read.  I did have a little trouble getting into it at the beginning but once the action picked up I enjoyed hhe book. Not too much sex and lots of suspense. The ending did suprise me a bit much to my delight.  An enjoyable book'
5	'Angela Biera never disappoints and this is stunningly true with her new novel A Second Chance. Every time I read one of her novels, I think, "wow. This is amazing. Nothing will ever top this." Then her next novel comes out and I\'m blown away again, as it becomes my new favorite novel. Her stories are fresh and exciting, packed with tear-jerking drama, heart-pounding action and steamy romance. Her writing is polished and crisp, descriptive, and some of the best out there. I can honestly say her work deserves so much more attention.\n\nThese characters are some of my favorites I have ever experienced. Their point of views are so interesting and unique, and very complex and deep. Their personalities are one-of-a-kind and definitely correlate with people you would want to meet in real life. And the relationships they forge within their stories... Completely addicting. Whether it\'s friendships or romances, they\'re perfectly imperfect and believeable, making them very hard to stop reading.\n\nOverall, this novel is unbelievable. The plot is a pleasant rollercoaster of emotions, the writing is spot-on, and the characters and their story is impossible to put down. I can honestly recommend this novel to everyone in the hopes that Angela Biera gets the attention she deserves!'
1	"I could have really loved this book. I loved the idea. I got about 50% done but just couldn't follow it. The sentences were ungainly. The characters interesting but I don't know who they are. I am sorry for the poor review. Maybe re edit for a smoother story..."
5	"I have found the quiz book to be excellent, a great way of refreshing one's memory and learning at the same time. It is a valuable asset to my library."
5	"While writing this enchanting tale Morin created an entirely new and extremely vivid world for her characters to live in. This faerie realm is very different from most other depictions of fae. There are some similarities, but Morin has gone out of her way to allow her readers to see her vision of this faerie realm. This extraordinary world combines with the adventure that the characters find themselves on to make you feel like you are immersed in the faerie kingdoms, fighting alongside them.\n\nThe characters in this novel are quite well developed, becoming real and jumping off of the page. They are also very fitting to their lives and their roles in the story. The sheltered princess acts and speaks differently from the wayward prince, and everyone is different from the dark sorcerer. Each character is developed individually, which means that there are no stock characters. The speech of the royal characters is also very formal and stilted, a phenomenon that is not seen in those characters who do not boast royal descent. This creates even greater character differentiation.\n\nOf course, what is an adventure where the princess doesn't fall for the handsome prince? We already have one matched couple, as well as a love triangle. I've already found myself hoping that 2 of the characters in the love triangle will end up together, and worrying that it will be the other two. These fae have become part of my life.\n\nI love the way that Morin writes. Her words flow together making a connection with her reader at every turn of the page. Her description of the environment, characters, and events are so real that you want to enter the faerie kingdoms and explore them for yourselves. You have a complete picture in your mind and are seeing the action while reading it."
5	'The Gate is a very captivating read. I think you could re-read it several times and get a different perspective everytime. Well written. The Gate incorporates some big existential themes that make for great discussion. This book would be great for a book club'
5	"A few story lines, fun read '"
5	'I enjoyed the entire series, the writing was on point  you got to know the characters, it so hard to find good books such as this.\nI would definitely recommend this book/ series.'
1	'I read part 1 and 2 in less than a day. Lets start with the good parts.\n1. Simone was smart, naive, brave and strong.  I loved her character.  She was always true to herself.  She refused to be weak and fall hopeless for money.\n2. Andriano was was extremely complex.  He was loving but selfish.  Nurturing and dark.  He was an amazing lead character.\n\n  The story was intriguing and kept you wanting to read more to figure out what was really happening.  It was engaging due to the complexity and twist of the story.  It also was great in that you got the perspective of multiple characters that helped to clarify information.\n\nWhat I hated:\n\nThe book needs a serious edit.  The grammar was horrible.\nVictoria was a pointless individual. First of all you are raised around the mob.  You know the rules and you know better.\nAndre?  what happened to him?  Why introduce a character that flakes out at the most important moment in her life and just never returns.\n\nThe ending of this book was probably the worst ending of any book I have read in the last 2-3 months.  On average I read 3 books a day.  Who massacres an entire family?  Who kills an children with a sledge hammer?  This ending ruined the entire book.  Epic fail.'
3	'An almost Good ending for a very good series. I liked the first book, and the second book was great. This book was good but the worst of the series for me.\n\nI think the concepts in this series would make for a good MMORPG. The Magic System is very cool.'
5	'This was not just a mere book, it was a mesmerizing, enlightening spiritual journey towards the discovery of the higher dimensions. Reading this masterpiece is so transformative, that one can never be just "one" again. Thank you, David Tangredi for writing this sequel to your other incredible book, Journey to the Temple of Ra. Looking so forward to the "third" in this series.'
5	"I'm a late comer to the Arcadia Series, so I started with the prequel The End of the Line. It just seemed to make sense to start at the beginning.\n\nThis installment is Avalon and Cane's story. Cane met Arcadia years before Cady's story began. Even then he recognized Cady's gifts. This story gives the reader a depth of understanding about the inner workings of Cane. The depth of teenage angst he's going through trying to get close to Cady, the only way he can see how- through her sister, Lony.\n\nI'm glad I read this first. It did give insights into the story before the story. The consistency in voice makes it a joy to read."
5	'Thanks!'
2	"I wanted this to be so much better, but it's kinda boring. Even the cliffhanger is boring.\n\nHelen is an unsophisticated single mom and is temping at a bank and is forced to work with Oliver who needs to put together a deal for his ailing uncle.  Told in dual POVs, we learn that they both begin to have feelings for each other (after a whole week), but he's got a hard and fast rule about not sleeping with employees and she doesn't want her heart broken because her soon to be ex husband is a loser.\n\nSpoiler alert:  These these people are completely stupid... or perhaps it's just a bad cliffy, but the big deal is that he's making her choose between being his employee or being his lover.  Good lord.  What a ridiculous choice that shouldn't even be a cliffhanger."
4	'Like the rest of this series, story is very different to the normal, but so enjoyable to read.'
5	'This a great mystery with lots of twists and turns. It also had a lot of Love in it. I enjoyed every minute of it from the beginning to the end. I would definitely recommend this book to read.'
5	'This is the cutest story I ever read!!  I highly recommend it to folks who love dog and angel stories!!!!'
2	"All this book has is stuff you already know from the books and mostly extremely boring letters. Don't waste your money."
4	'Characters each had different issues and the story was fast paced.  It was a good read.  I read the rest of the Christmas Tree series and was entertained.'
4	'Emotional read that was captivating and enjoyable to read... well written with a steady pace to keep the reader attention to see how the story unfolds.'
5	'This story is about loss, love and finally understanding. Harrison met Tiffany when he first joined the Marines with Matt. They became fast friends and Harrison met Tiffany. When they start having trouble and tragedy strikes will they be able to get over how things were in the past and see what they have both been missing. Just wait until you found out a few little surprises also.'
5	"I have been borrowing these books from the Kindle library. From the first chapter I have been enthralled, I am just disappointed that I can only borrow one book a month. This series draws you in quickly and makes you feel for the characters all the pain and hardships that they endure. but there is also a light side to all the dark also, I think that is why you get captured so quickly by this series, Ican't wait to get to the next book."
5	'Exciting stories for my dino daughter. She loves them!!'
5	'it Grabbed me, pulled me in, Shook me and took me along with the story. so happy to read how it ended...but sad to know i was done ..letting all my friends know ... its a MUST read !'
4	"I just LOVE Amanda Hocking!\nThis is a kind of a prequel to Wake. I read Wake and Lullaby a while back, and stumbled upon this now. A quick read. I finished it in less than an hour. Now I've got some more background it's characters and Capri. Can't wait for the last book in the trilogy !!!"
5	'Not sure what to say, it was a good book.  I would recommend this to other men of faith.'
5	'I loved this! A well developed story. Obviously I want to hear the space stations tale too.  How did they survive,  where did that new drive come from. Also, how do they meet the challenges of trying to help. a super frigid, super hot earth?  Come on, just one more book!'
5	"Wow, this is the first book in a long time I couldn't put down! Excellent fast paced writing,  great character development and the werewolf is terrifying! I would love for the sequel to explain the monsters existence further."
5	"Number seven in the series, Peter Watt had better write another one or I'll be disappointed. The story's not finished yet as the old aboriginal Wallarie has more of his story to relate to his young relative under the bumbill tree. I had read the first 4 books some years ago then decided it was time to catch up. I bought all 7 books for my kindle and read them all, re-reading the first four. It's a wonderful series and won't disappoint any reader. If you haven't read any of them download them all and hibernate for a few weeks, you won't regret it. I find books written with an Australian outback theme thoroughly entertaining and Peter Watt won't disappoint. The first book in the series had an eye-opening storyline about the culling of aboriginals in the 1860s; starting off a series of events that was to plague the Scottish and Irish families for many generations. A truly great read and a seies that I hope Watt will continue."
3	'I purchased this book because it was recommended to me when I asked for inspiring book to help me be a little more proactive in life. It is an ok book in that it tells the story of a man who is the definition of a go-getter (which is what I was looking for), but it was hard for me to get into it. It was good, not great. It was hard for me to relate to it, but I definitely got the message-it shall get done. Short read with a great message.'
3	'Devyn is looking to find love and settle down. Her last relationship ended badly, and she is struggling to get past it. Her best friend Dezi entourages her to sign up for a website she is connected with for people looking for one night stands only. Devyn agrees and has a pretty spectacular one night stand with "Maverick". She can\'t stop thinking about him afterward and a couple months later she runs into him somewhere she does not expect. The circumstances are now extremely complicated, but what hasn\'t changed is the intense physical attraction the two of them share.\n\nI don\'t want to spoil anything, so I\'ll try to stay a little vague about plot related stuff. I will say that this story hooked me in quick and kept me interested to see where things would go. There were times when I was frustrated with pretty much each character in this book, but I ended up caring about all of them in the end. Except one character who just kept proving to be someone worse than anyone realized initially. At times the dialogue was a little choppy, but there were only a couple times when I found it distracting. The plot was definitely interesting, but this is erotica people so lets get to the sex. And there is sex aplenty in here. Lots of sex, lots of kink, mf, ff, mfmf. These characters are hot and hot for each other. If you are looking for a sexy read with an interesting story line, check this out. I would read more by this author in the future. 3.5 stars.'
5	'I really thought the story would be too short to get in as much detail, emotions, or draw me into it like it did.  Being a Vet I ordered this one with my fingers crossed.  Well done, Ms Rose, well done.'
2	'There are better books that describe the evil shenanigans of L. Ron Hubbard and Scientology, and don\'t have the baggage of having been written by a permanently disbarred attorney, who\'s on a campaign to "restore" (as if it ever existed) Hubbard\'s and Scientology\'s good name.\n\nThe reader is told of scandalous evil deeds by Scientology, only to find that, according to the author, the evil emanated, not from L. Ron Hubbard or Scientology but from anti Scientologists masquerading as Scientologists.\n\nEssentially, this is a PR and denial book for Scientology that, at first glance, appears to be a tell-all truth book.\n\nIf read with that in mind, one won\'t be fooled, and it\'s worth a look.'
5	'I loved this. I have not read one of these in a long time.  Great read.'
4	'I really enjoyed this book series.  I have been a fan of James Rollins for some time.  This is a compelling new group of characters.'
5	'This is just such a cute book to read. The pictures are really cute.'
5	"Great book, keeps you in suspense. You don't know what to expect next. I can't wait to read part two of the Church Girls series."
4	"First off, these are not serious in any way...think Star Trek meets The Hitchhikers' Guide...but quite enjoyable...a perfect lazy afternoon read."
5	'I just want to say this book is one of the reasons Violet Duke is quickly becoming one of my favorite authors! A sweet love story with twists, turns and a great deal of forgiveness! An engrossing, difficult to put down, amazing story!'
5	'Very informative book for someone who already has a basic knowledge of taekwondo.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone.  Easy to ready and follow and some great advice.'
1	'Just read it for yourself. If I have to be scarred so do you.'
5	'I bought this book when got hired by a foreclosure firm that provided no training. This book gives a very simple, clear overview of the whole process with an excellent explanation of all terms. Definitely recommend!'
4	'addictive...bought the entire series....likeable, well defined characters...'
3	'helpful'
4	'Very interesting reading. I will never think of the Special Olympics again without appreciating everyone involved with them, especially the the participants.'
5	"I have enjoyed seeing on stage (and,full disclosure,I also had a very small and insignificant role in) the musical version of this work. It is set mainly in a grimy laundromat owned by a disreputable character who is a modern version of the mustache-stroking villain from silent films. The play is both a fantasy (in which alien sock puppets play a delightfully humorous role) and a gritty evocation of what can happen to average people in bad times. It explores the depressing lows and occasional manic highs in the lives of an out-of-work middle manager, an ex-grad student and a delusional homeless man whom life and the economy have tossed out of the middle class and into the bottom of society's barrel. While many in the audience will see themselves, family members or friends in these characters, the poignancy of their stories is relieved not only by the sock puppets but by a wonderful chorus of cops and laundromat customers and a boffo surprise ending.\n\n The work can be produced with minimal sets, e.g.,in the version I saw a few boards, a coat of paint and a little hardware easily evoked the laundromat's washing machines. While it would be ideal in the musical version to have a few  reasonably good voices in the cast, any one who can sing in tune will generally fill the bill for most of the singing parts---and school or church choir members would be perfect.\n\nAll in all this work can provide a delightful theater experience for the production staff, the actors and the audience."
5	"Very fast short read. A Forbidden romance between shifter and vampire. Lots of steam! If you're a fan of paranormal romance and are looking for a fast read this book is for you. Can't wait to read the next story in this series!"
1	'did not want to by this item I want a refund!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!'
5	"this is a great series for all even if you don't play games like d&d or wow its a great story for all love it"
5	"Received as an ARC for honest review.\n\nThis book picks up right where book 2 ended. I love Cooper and Allison! The tension and sexual chemistry is hot! A little what goes around, comes around drama!\n\nI don't give spoilers, and I'm afraid I will do just that if I keep talking! This is one series you don't want to miss! I'm sad that Cooper and Allison's story is over! LOVED IT!!!\n\nCan't wait to see what KB has in store for us in the future!!"
5	'Wonderful book about a wonderful women.'
5	'This book was very entertaining and I say very well written. Sure there were a couple typos, but it flowed so nicely!'
5	'This is an outstanding book on the life of St. Faustina.'
4	"I LOVED this book!  The twists and turns were unpredictable and kept me reading until the wee hours so I could find out how it ended - which was a TOTAL surprise and CLIFFHANGER!  I guess I hadn't noticed that it was #1 in a series, and now I'm frustrated because I have to wait until summer to find out what happens next. :/"
5	'Another fun, light read from Diane Kelly.'
5	'Great story. I love the chapter going back and forth between characters. Each book gives you just enough and then leaves you wanting more'
2	'while it did offer some insight into improvised weapons nothing you haven"t seen before or thought of before.  The good part was that it constantly reminted you of the aftermath of your actions'
3	'An easy (almost simple) plot makes this a light read, easy to finish in a few hours. The end comes at 74%, in case you get there and feel a little cheated. The rest continues the story into a sample of the sequel that I will not be reading. Sorry, Robyn. I don\'t like it enough to keep going.\n\nEssie ran away from home a year ago because she found out her man cheated on her.  Hank wasn\'t letting her go that easy, and you learn exactly the lengths he went to to keep tabs on her, but that\'s neither here nor there. Anyway, Essie is handed a mission of missing weres that takes her right back to Hank "the Tank" and his sexy arms. (Insert gag here)\n\nThe best part, what kept a smile on my face the entire way was Granny. Her intro had me giggling, and I still smile when I think of here.\n\nWhat didn\'t I like is a bit longer.... The other characters were dumb and too much funny. Robyn tried making a romantic comedy, and it would have been okay if there was more to the story without random and convenient solutions. The bathroom scene? The reader learns she didn\'t even have the gumption to talk to him about it.\n\nThere aren\'t enough descriptions to get a clear picture of the characters other than how tall and if they have hair. In granny\'s case, we learn she looks in her 40s.'
5	'first of all if you are a survivalist or prepper you probabaly subscribe to this magazine.  if you want to know how to get by when a emergency happens this is the magazine to get.  everyone is affected by energy from brown or black outs to what is happening now in new york and new jersey.  want to learn how to survive a 1 day to a month when SHTF?  what if you need to evacuate?  what to take, what to leave.  this magazine will help with the questions you have.  technology is great until the power goes out-look again at the east coast.  you cannot rely on the government for help--again look at the east coast.  this issue sheds more light on the energy issue that we face today--this is issue #7.  all 7 issues have been fantastic--you learn what needs to be done.  i only subscribe to periotocals that are useful and create a better knowledge base for me.  i am so impressed with this magazine that i subscribe to the hard copy and also to the digital one also.  i store the hard copies for later referance for when technology will fail.'

4	"What a heart wrenching story! This is the third book in this series by Marquita Valentine. I've loved them all, but there is just something about second chance romances that pulls me in every time.\nLuke messed up big time. He would be the first to admit it. Now. Not when he was younger. His pride got in the way and with it he lost the one woman that he has loved for years. Now that he is older, less arrogant and realizing that he misses having someone to love that is just his Luke moves back home to start up a clinic for the local farm workers and hopes to get Lily back in his life.\nLily is loving her quiet life away from the city. She is enjoying teaching her dance students at her dance studio, her friends and just the fulfillment that her quiet routine brings her. There are times that she misses having someone special that is just hers, but most days her life works just the way it is. When Luke walks back into her life she's shocked, but looking forward to see how they do as friends when they couldn't make their marriage work all of those years ago.\nJust about the time that things seem to be going so well and they are enjoying their new found friendship Lily is in a horrible car accident that leaves her in a coma. When Lily wakes from her coma she has lost her memory of the last ten years of her life and believes that she and Luke are newlyweds. Luke is afraid to tell her the truth. What if she wants nothing to do with him? After all of progress they've made to repair their relationship now he must tell her what an idiot he had been and that he had chosen money over their marriage.\n\nI was given an ARC from the author/publisher. All conclusions are mine and mine alone."
5	"This was my first time reading anything by this author but it definitely don't be the last. It was a fun and charming story that will have you falling in love with the Lacy and Tim from the very beginning. I was rooting for them the whole way. The secondary characters are fantastic as well. Great read overall!!"
5	"Mrs. Jones is now officially my go-to author. I really enjoyed reading Ty and Lauren's story. This is the second book I've read by her and I've not been disappointed at all! Thank you."
5	"I liked this book. I have read some of Kate's previous books and this is equal to or better. I like most books that start out in an Irish Pub. Darcy is a poor little rich girl. She wants to be normal. She is under Daddy's thumb. She comes in to the pub with friends and sees the man who passed her up years ago. Beck was a foster child from the streets. Spoiler. He was taken in by the Dempsey's and got 4 brothers and a sister. His Dad,Sean, and brother Logan were firefighters who died in a fire. Beck is now a firefighter. Spoiler. He still loves her. She loves him but can't forgive him for giving her up. Big Spoiler. She stays away from Daddy by travelling and works on her art. Big Spoilers. This is a mature story. This is a good story. I hope you choose to read this book. It is a fairly quick read. Give this book a chance. Enjoy! I have this book for an honest review for NetGalley."
4	'Was an awesome read and will definitely read more from this author.'
1	"Very disappointed with the book. Next time I'll order from Domino or somebody else. This book is JUST a joke."
5	'This is my 4th book I have read by Mr Moody. I have enjoyed them all. Love the Characters and the fact that each book does have a ending. You will be more familiar with the characters by reading from book 1.  We find Elmo in this book helping get a contemporary worship service going at First Church a new Pastor in the picture and Elmo is going to be a dad and a mystery to solve.  I think you will enjoy this book I know I did. A clean read not preachy and some humor. Go ahead give these books a try.'
1	'Not in tune with P&P.  I decided I wasted my money and put it down when I reached the second pornographic scene.'
5	'Given the constant change in todays business environment, Robert Dickie has written a "must read" for anyone considering "Taking the Leap".  His transparency is humbling, proving that it does not matter where you are... it only matters where you are committed to going.  The Leap gives you clear guidance as well as tremendous inspiration.  As someone who has recently taken the Leap... I highly recommend!'

Mr Cliettes engaging story-telling is interspersed with lovely photographs and a map of Germany.  For readers of this book, Mr Cliettes presentation is a virtual tour of Germany.'
5	'This is the third book so make sure you read the first two before you read this. The whole story is wonderful.'
5	'Its almost like they put more work into this book than they did the game. There is a lot of great content in here that never made it to the game, and everything thats in the game is also in the book.\n\nIt has high detail artwork of every item and main character in the game, as well as creatures, locations, concept pieces, etc.\n\nWould recommend to someone who enjoys the unique art direction Bethesda took in Fallout 4.'
5	'The book was suspenseful but. In a low key way. I always enjoy a first person narrative. This one allowed for a lot of speculation. Dennisbrown1934@yahoo. Com'
5	'What a great book!  I would definitely read it again  Nice job, C.R.Leverette.'
5	'Enjoyed the whole series. This is a Trilogy.'
5	'Short read but enjoyable till the end. Missed Pike Logan and Jennifer. Then again Taskforce is more than just them.'
4	'couldn,t put it down'
3	'Enjoyable read.  I liked the characters but found the plot a little thin.'
4	'This audio version is phenomenal...full of lively interpretation all by one narrator. Yet the lack of a chapter guide makes it extremely difficult to use should you be interested in tracking down a particular chapter. Some chapters start in the middle of disks or even in the middle of tracks. My 7th graders love to listen to it, so it has been worth the aggravation of trying to find which chapter is where.'
1	'The book has no illustrations, and sometimes the wording makes it difficult to understand. So the mechanics of the illusion is itself an illusion.'
4	'it was a fun easy read'
4	"Layla's story is the third and final book in this steamy historical romance series.  The number one suspect in the murder of her husband, Jean, Layla is in need of legal services.  Her hatred of her husband puts her in a bad place with the law, and unfortunately, the only lawyer willing to help her, is Drew, her husband's lawyer and a man she absolutely despises.  Left with no other choice, she hires Drew to defend her.  Drew is not convinced of Layla's innocence, and is determined to acquit her of this crime, with an ulterior motive in mind.  His attraction to Layla is intense, and he has high hopes of developing a relationship with her.  Her trust in him, however, is little to none, and their heated confrontations lead to some intense fireworks.\n\nThis series wrapped up very nicely.  The mystery of who killed Jean is finally solved, and all of the wives have found their happiness, thanks to the ignorance and selfishness of Jean.  I was glad to see Layla find someone, and the sexual tension between she and Drew is so thick.  Their stubbornness made their relationship incredibly hot and very enjoyable.\nOverall, I really enjoyed this series.  The unique spin that the author put on the storyline itself made it all the more interesting for me, and I liked each one of the characters.  Their quirks and flaws made the stories real and their erotic encounters brought plenty of steam to the series too!  If historical romance is something you enjoy, do yourselves a favor, and pick up this series.  You'll be glad you did.\n\nreviewed by Marie\nbook provided by author for the purpose of an honest review"
3	'We never hear much about the Korean war.. this was a nice story about how the troops became attached and rallied about a special comrade - Reckless their War Horse.. a bit long at the end of the book but informative and very interesting at the beginning.'
3	'I read The Worth series books by Mara Jacobs out of order. I am now glad I did because when I first I first met Alison as a therapist in Worth the Effort, I really liked her.  She seemed like a great person. Then I went on to read the other Worth books--Worth the Drive, Worth the Weight, and Alison started to annoy me. She just didn\'t seem to have the demeanor of a therapist in her interactions with her friends. I guess I just envisioned her as being more thoughtful and less outspoken. Perhaps this was the author\'s intent--Alison has a very different personality than her friends and this needed to be shown.\n\nOther reviewers said Worth the Fall was their favorite book and really liked the story of Alison and Petey (a hockey player) getting together. I was excited to read it, thinking I\'d learn more about Alison and come to like her better. But sadly, that wasn\'t the case. I skipped most all of the intimate love scenes between her and Petey. And I never got the feeling they really liked each other past the intimacy, or even why they would. They seemed to have little in common and didn\'t have a tenderness between them. Their story does get revealed which explains their  dynamic, but it still didn\'t endear me to either of them.\n\nThis story is well written, as are all the stories in the other books. I must admit I skip the love scenes precisely because they are so well written, if that makes any sense. I feel like I am intruding on a very private scene. They are much more detailed than your usual romance novel love scenes. No euphemisms for Ms. Jacobs.\n\nThe characters in all the books are believable. However, sometimes the love "push/pull" between the characters gets a little tedious, but the books are still fun to read and very engaging. I recommend them all. Worth the Fall just wasn\'t my cup of tea, I guess.\n\nI do like the quotes that begin each chapter. They are always well chosen and poignant to the story. And sometimes quite funny. My favorite in Worth the Fall was one by Rodney Dangerfield--I\'m quoting here from memory so forgive if not exact--"Sometimes I go to the fights and a hockey game breaks out."\n\nIf you\'ve read the other books, you\'ll want to read this one too if only to learn more about what makes Alison the way she is.'
4	'Was a different way at looking at things'
4	'Sharon Hamilton delivered once again. I really enjoyed this story, and the heat went up several degrees from the first page and stayed that way through the whole book *Fans self.* The main characters goes through what most couples do in the start of a relationship, but in the end they get their HEA. I really look forward to the next book by Sharon.'
3	"This is really more of a very, VERY basic follow-along tutorial than any kind of actual reference book.  I bought it hoping to be able to search for how to do specific tasks (e.g. how to curve text along a path).  I would have rated myself as a rank beginner with GIMP, but this quick tutorial covered really nothing I hadn't already figured out for myself.  Searching it was cumbersome (although that might be a Kindle thing rather than an issue with this eBook specifically), and there's neither index nor table of contents.\n\nNow off to spend $25 or $30 on, hopefully, a real reference book.  Oh well."
4	"This was a good book, a page turner from beginning to end. I love to see the underdog succeed!  I couldn't give the book 5 stars because of the typos.  But a good read nonetheless.  I look forward to reading more from Carlos King."
4	'Good storyline.'
2	"The story had little depth and drug on and on. I skipped 3 or 4 chapters and yet rally didn't miss anything."
2	"A 'll I can really say about this story is that it was to short. You get to the real good part a and then it's over need to finish as h the story."
3	"I read In From The Cold by this author and really like it. It hinted on the guy's parent's relationship so I thought this might be interesting. I'm sorry to say that it was kind of lackluster especially where the female character comes in. Her character was plain and boring and there was no heat between her and the guys. She really didn't fit in, like a third wheel, and I didn't want her there. Eric and Nick were pretty hot together but something was still missing to keep me interested. This was a DNF for me."
4	"This was a great short read. The story was well rounded, the interaction between the characters smacking of joy and heartbreak as their relationship went from down to up again. The sex scenes were smoking hot and I couldn't put it down.\n\nI do wish we had seen Elodie's POV as all of the story was from Flick's. And the way the two girls broke up-wow. Flick had a good reason to be mad but the resolution at the end was a little too easy. I also wondered about Elodie being so afraid to come out if her sister was also a lesbian with the full support of her mother. Without Elodie's POV, it was hard to get a good read on her and the story was a little incomplete. In other words-more please! Great story-just wanted multiple POV like you get in many romance novels, so it pulls you deeper into what each character is feeling."
1	'This book originally said that it was free so I decided to download.  As soon as I pressed the buy with one click button I realised that it actually cost $3.27. Never would have paid this.'
3	'Cute story but drug out. The book could have been wrapped up in half the time.'
1	"Terrible.  The 'author' took scanned copies of old magazines, and put them in some form layout.  Not only is this not his stories, the stories are shrunk down to 1/4 of the page your viewing because he did a crappy job of scanning them in, making them all but unreadable."
2	'It was a decent enough beach read which is why I gave it two stars, but the New Zealand expressions became tiresome when spoken by anyone other than Gracie. Notes to the author:\n(1) It\'s easy enough to research "Americanisms." Borrow Gracie\'s book.\n(2) Americans don\'t drink instant coffee unless we\'re desperate for a caffeine fix.\n(3) Gracie\'s retail therapy made my credit cards cringe and I make a lot more money than any teacher I know.\n(4) I don\'t know anyone that refers to their vehicle by its brand name.\nI could go on, but I won\'t. I also won\'t be reading any more books in the series.'
4	"Loved the suspense that went along with the book. It hints at the problem that Declan faces, but it does not come right out in the beginning and ruin the suprise for the readers. Keeps us wanting to read more. Liked how it was a slow courtship on Law's part not just rushing in. Though I wished we could have gotten a duel sided version of what was going on from bloth Declan and Law and how they were reacting to each other. Hopefully the next book in the series comes out soon!"
3	'Started out strong, loved the story, but then it got a little sex heavy and it interfered with the story. Also, it get too cheesy toward the end. And then there\'s "Little Dynamo". I could live without ever reading that again. Very overdone.'
1	"I found this to be unusable.  Hard to find concordance locations.  I am a novice on computer  skills, but that shouldn't explain my difficulties."
4	'Definitely some good ideas.  Nothing spectacular but nice overview.  Every little bit of knowledge helps.  I give this book four stars.'
4	'The Final Colony is a short story that instantly reminds you of pulp science fiction or of a tale inside one of those great  sci-fi anthologies. It is fast, original, submerges you inside an amazing universe, and when you thought you knew what was going to happen next, it pulls the rug from under your feet.\nIn a word, it is a great quick read for anyone who enjoys getting their mind blown.'

They refuse to believe that a guy and a girl cannot just be best friends. They met their freshman year at college and have been besties for the last six years. In fact they are even roommates. Parker has had a boyfriend, Lance, for the past five years, and Ben enjoys his man whoreish ways bringing home girls that Parker has to help him get rid of in the morning. Everything in their life is perfect, well they thought.\n\nThen Lance breaks up with Parker and she realizes she should have seen it coming and that she isn't even that upset about it when she thinks about it, it is more about missing sex. So Ben's job as best friend then becomes helping Parker let loose and get some. However they both soon realize that just isn't Parker. So Parker has a light bulb moment where she cannot figure out why they can't just have a few benefits with their friendship. This takes a bit of consideration because neither want to screw up their friendship but of course they decide to give it a try.\n\nAt first they both can't figure out why they haven't added the benefits to their friendship before, but as time starts to pass they both realize that the only one they want to be with is each other. That is great right, wrong each is afraid to mention it because they don't want to lose their friend. Next thing you know the ex wants Parker back and Ben starts to date one of Parkers friends. Now they are at the point they both dreaded, they have lost their friend and possible love. So maybe guys and girls can't be just friends?\n\nThe question is will Parker and Ben get it all or lose it all?\n\nI loved this story, yes there is a little angst but just enough to keep you going, it is not long and drawn out. IF you love best friend to lovers books you do not want to miss this one. I fell in love with both Ben and Parker."

Brian and Jill are step siblings and while their parents are vacationing in Mexico Jill wants to have a party at the house before all of her friends take off for college. After some persuading Brian agrees but there is one catch, everyone has to be naked that attends. This book was on the HOT HOT HOT side of things, there are a lot of brother/sister interaction as well as party goers getting it on.'
4	'I loved everything about the first book that I bought the whole series. The characters make you feel alive and you can just imagine yourself in that little town and they are your neighbors and friends.'
2	'The story line is awesome I gave the first book 3 stars because I was hoping that the author would have got better editing done on the 2nd book but No such luck the grammatical errors are horrible. This author needed to find an editor who will do the work. Way to many mistakes.'
1	'The author displays a basic misunderstanding of a number of physical concepts, and then expounds a theory based on those misunderstandings. First, the book describes differences in spatial density and hence in the nature of fundamental particles based on the proximity of  a particular spatial region to the "center" of the big bang. But the big bang theory is one of the expansion of space itself; there is no "center" of the big bang. Second, in describing "tesserons" as a fundamental spatial unit, the author incorrectly describes a tesseract (which is the "shape" of his tesseron), as having one dimension which is at 45 degrees to the others. This is true of a particular *projection* of a four dimensional tesseract into three dimensions, but a true tesseract is a four dimensional figure in which there there are four mutually perpendicular edges convergent at each vertex. The final straw for me was in the use of tesserons as an explanation for quantum entanglement. Here the author displays a basic misunderstanding of dimensional analysis, taking the 3/2 power of a quantity (the speed of light along a "xyz" direction) in km/sec and interpreting it as another speed of light (in an "xy" direction) in the same units. He then takes the ratio of these to assert that signals along this xy direction can travel over 500x as fast as in the xyz direction. But this ratio is totally dependent on the units used; he would get a different ratio and hence a different increase in speed along an xy direction vs an xyz direction if he used (for example) miles per second. Since fundamental physical relationships are not dependent on our arbitrary choice of units, this is patently absurd.'

3	"`I'll be Home for Christmas' is a short M/M e-book novella from Adrianna Dane.\n\nDestrie `Two Rivers' has returned home to Wyoming after an eight-year absence. . . and his reason for leaving is sitting at the bar he walks into on his first night back. Benedict Webster - he was once Destrie's best friend, then lover, and his elder brother viciously attacked Destrie and sent him packing for the United States Army.\n\nDestrie is back in town for his foster father's funeral. But seeing Benedict ignites an old flame, even if both men know that they'll never have anything more than a carnal fling. Because Benedict won't leave Wyoming, and Wyoming won't ever accept what Destrie and Benedict mean to each other. . . but maybe all that will change when Christmas is in the air.\n\nI liked the first half of this book, but felt that the second half ran away from the author.\n\nThe premise starts out bitter-sweetly wonderful and wrought with tension. Destrie left Wyoming after a gay-bashing, and he returns after eight years to unchanged hostility and the knowledge that what he is will never be accepted by the small town's small-minds. Not even serving for his nation's army will change these people's opinions. But Destrie likewise can't change the way he feels about Benedict - his high school sweetheart and only man he has ever loved. These two are combustible and I was not surprised when, in the opening chapter, they're getting hot n' heavy against an alley wall.\n\n[...]\nMaybe the Wyoming setting and rancher characters are reminiscent of `Brokeback Mountain' - but the resemblances are only superficial. The Wyoming setting is actually really beautifully written and utilized by Dane, who casts the dusty landscape according to her character's moods and the tension of the scene.\n\nThe book started to get away from me half-way through. . . when Adrianna Dane seems to remember that she's writing a Christmas-themed M/M and throws in a ghost (of Christmas past?) for good measure, to steer Benedict on the right path. Then Destrie learns a few unsettling things about the interim eight years and what Benedict has been doing with his time. . . and then Dane throws in a sordid past for Benedict and Destrie's parents to really tie the plot into a knot.\n\nI didn't think all these extra bits and pieces were really necessary to the storyline. There was enough tension and drama simply in Destrie coming home, and facing rampant homophobia, I didn't need all those other curveballs.\n\nThe sex scenes are hot and sensual, Destrie and Benedict have chemistry that ignites the page. . . but I wish Adrianna Dane had kept to the adage `less is more' and not made her plot so soap-opera complicated."

1	'Hated it. Had to delete it.'
4	"I don't have any complaints about the book, the Christian content was present but not preachy and there was the required happy ending. Still, It was too lightweight to fall into the five star category."
3	'While this is an OK read,... it\'s not really "book length". This and "book 2" probably should have been published as one book. This seems to be a common tactic among E-Book authors these days. I guess some think they make more money this way. The other tactic they use are "episodes" done on a weekly, monthly basis. Publish the BOOK ! I won\'t pay for anything else ! !'

3	"The selection was a good book. It wasn't over the top intense, nor was it completely boring. There was a good plotline and lovable characters (with unique names I must say). My favorite person had to be the innocent yet powerful gentleman: Prince maxon. He was certainly a delight, but over that, I love how the political gameplay makes sense as well. Anyway, though this book satisfied me, I hope the next ones prove to be better!"

4	"Jus Accardo has done it again. She really can paint a picture with words. Make a story come alive and evolve into a full-motion movie in your head. She had me from Chapter One. Jax's clever, smart-ass comments and quick wit kept me turning the pages and the plot's sudden twist left my head spinning with disbelief. I know you'll enjoy this new series if you just give it a chance."

4	'Voodoo On Bayou LaFonte by Susan C. Muller takes place in Comeaux, Louisiana.  It is suspenseful, exciting, and definitely a page turner.  It has dead people; good and bad voodoo; corrupt officials; some drug dealing; and to top it off, a love story thrown in as well.\n  Remy Steinberg lives and works in Houston, Texas as a member of law enforcement.  His life changes in a few seconds when he receives a call from his ex-wife, Gabby.  Their seventeen year old daughter, Adrienne, is missing.  Remy drops everything and rushes to Comeaux to find his daughter.  He still loves Gabby and memories of their early years invade his mind.  Is this his fault?  Could he have been a better father to Adrienne?\n  Once the action starts you will be surprised and hooked.  After some investigation, they find out that not only is Adrienne missing, but she is also pregnant.  How did this happen, and more importantly, who is the father?  Something evil and sinister within the dark voodoo community wants this baby and will stop at nothing to get it.  I gripped my chair hoping that Gabby and Remy could rescue Adrienne before the devil himself won.  Hold on tight as they battle through storms, roadblocks at every turn, and the inky black swap to get to their only child.  Tragedy brings them together again in this twist of fate but they both expect to go their separate ways once Adrienne and her baby are safe.\n  You must get this book to find out if Adrienne and her baby make it out alive and if all of them manage to survive unbelievable evil.  I learned some things about the culture of Louisiana, the customs passed down through the generations, and strength of family bonds.  Adriennes rescue is the main theme, but there are also sub-stories going on as well.  I hope there is a sequel because I do have some questions about Adriennes pregnancy.  Do not miss this one!  Parents will take any chances and do anything for their child and this story makes that fact so evident.  I definitely recommend it.'
1	'After I read this book I immediately came to see the ratings and was SHOCKED to see to many at 5 stars.  As another reviewer wrote, I hate leaving bad reviews but this book was just terrible.  Thankfully I was able to read it on a flight when I had nothing else to do.  I have read this author before and have enjoyed those books.  As an admitted occasional fluff reader, usually books like this help pass time and give a smile or two along the way.  This book made me LOL many times and left me confused in others.\n\nSo let\'s get to it!  In other reviews, my fellow readers brought up the issues with the word box here, and yes it was gratuitous, but what about the term "sugar walls" that was actually used more than one time (true story)?  Creative, yes...a bit ick, HELL yes.  The other was how they were in Economy class together which to most of us is known as Economics.  The NCAA/NFL thing was just a joke and if you know the rules on how amateur sports work, this depiction of all the gifts and money actually took away from the story.  The hero wanted to be both "the guy next door" and the "rich, player athlete" and it just didn\'t work.  The interaction between the two was just rapey and I like a little feisty in those scenes.  It read like a 14 yo boy who read 50 Shades of Grey and figured, "what the hell, I will give it a try" and failed miserably.  She was an annoying lead character who was so woe is me at every turn that it got annoying.  The on again/off again that usually adds to the angst just added to the nonsense considering their relationship was based on him wanting her box and her needing someone to take care of her.  The new paragraph for every sentence also made the book choppy and was sometimes hard to follow who was actually speaking.\n\nI will sum this up by saying, if you have ever seen the movies that spoof genres like Scary Movie, this came off like a spoof by taking the usual formula and just throwing in every cliche and then multiplying.  I will say, I got some really good laughs from this book but I am not sure it was humor the author intended.  I do recommend her other books, this one just seemed like there was a deadline to hit.'
2	"Didn't really learn anything new from this cookbook.  It is geared more toward people who have never used a crockpot but the recipes seem to be a little bit complicated with many ingredients.  I believe beginner crockpotters would benefit more from recipes that are much easier and with fewer ingredients."
4	'Another great read by Lexi Ryan. She never disappoints and always leaves you wanting more. Even in a short prequel she is well written while filling in on past, present, and a mysterious future.'

4	'Very good account.  Another winner for Ambrose.'
2	"I kept wanting to quit reading the book without finishing. I seldom do that and didn't this time either.  The story was hidden in the constant over done description of Boston; street by street, over and over.  I would not recommend this book unless one has a vast desire to learn Boston geography."
4	"First off this is not a get rich quick ways to get moeny. Some of the jobs need more work then others. This is a great guide if you have a work from home business idea but don't who what you have to do to be able to successfully run the business. Some of the amounts might be a little off depending on the areas. I think the author was just trying to have a low base of starting off point in income. This book was very helpful as I had questions about a few business ideas and this book helped clear them up for me. For license talked about for some you will also have to check with local laws as some places are stricter then others. I would suggest this being a good book for just out of high school and not knowing what to do in life. This is a great way to point you in the right direction. This can also be for anyone wanting to make a big change in their lives. This was a free kindle book."

4	'Honestly, that is what I like the most about low carbs diet. I can still have meats in my meals and lose weight at the same time. This is a healthy diet which takes into account all nutricents our bodies need. It is advised for stable weight control, not extreme weight loss. I like the detailed list of things for shopping and restocking the kitchen as well as the 21-day meal plans. The recipes are specific and well structured, delicious and easy to follow. Very useful book! I am motivated to take this challenge!'
4	'This was very informative and told us many things about Marty\'s early years.  It was interestingly written and very personal.  I would like to have read more about his\nlater active years in the music business, but it was about his "early years."  Good reading.'
4	"Mike Bennett's podcast work is a brilliant mix of humor, horror, and often filthy fun. Although reading his words on the page doesn't give you the benefit of his spirited performances and endless spool of character voices, it is no doubt a magnificent bargain to own his work at 99. If you're into King, Barker, or any of the other masters, buy this now. You can say you knew Bennett's work before he blew up."

1	'I did not enjoy this book, "Super Mario: The Funniest Super Mario Jokes." It said in the title that there were funny jokes, but instead it was just not fun at all. I think it should have good jokes in it instead. Also I think that the book should be longer. It seemed about only 10 pages long. I hope it does better next time!'

1	"I purchased this on kindle after reading a number of positive reviews. Having had to stop reading this dismal book about two thirds of the way through, I'm bewildered at how anybody could give this novel four stars, or even two.  As a positive, Hughes' account of African hunting is excellent and obviously drawn from first-hand experience.  He goes into cartridge types, techniques, animal behavior, etc. and gives you a real sense of what being on a safari is like day-to-day. I could have read this for some time, but about a third of the way through the book it gives way to the horribly written plot and accompanying dialogue which is really some of the poorest I've ever read.  About 70% of the way through, I figured this book wasn't worth continuing -rarely have I made such a decision.\nThe storyline here is remarkably similar to Wilbur Smith's 'A Time to Die' (i.e. Zimbabwean Safari gone wrong, ex-Rhodesian army soldiers taking matters into their own hands, intertwined with corny romance). I rate Smith's book as one of my favorite Africa novels; it beats this one hands down.\nSmith's book also contains some decent descriptions of hunting, but those seeking more would be better off reading Hemmingway's 'Green Hills of Africa', or some of the great white hunter works by folks such as Frekerick Courteney Selous, than reading 'Zimbabwe'.\nNot recommended."
4	'Very enjoyable historical story about a young woman trying to escape her past. I usually don\'t always enjoy stories where one character keeps important information from the other, especially throughout most of the story, but the author handled this very well. I thought Reeve was a bit strict at first, but he quickly grew on me. And I really liked his reaction once he found out the truth. Melanie was a great mix of innocence and temptation.  Her interactions with Mae and her "girls" were both humorous and touching. The addition of Olivia and Forrest made the story even better! I didn\'t like Forrest much at first - he wronged Olivia yet proceeded to punish her for her retaliation. I was hoping Forrest would have apologized or at least felt guilty about it. He became much more likable as the story progressed, and it was fun seeing this tough cowboy fall in love. Certainly a story worth reading!'
4	"Cheating and Cliffhangers are two of my book pet peeves, because of that I didn't think I would like this novella. Boy, was I surprised!\n\nI was quickly hooked and very interested to see what possible relationship Lily was going to have and what's in store for her once she gets back home. Short and sexy! I'm excited and can't for book two's release in June, Calla Lily."

Hard to determine what age level should be reading this.  Possibly youth?  What I did like was it seemed like the beginning of quite an adventure for this young boy.  I would not discourage anyone from at least reading the first snippet and if really interested in what you see-go for it.\n\nKJK"
3	'A quick, uncomplicated read.'

4	'Things come apart so easily when they have been held together with lies.\n----Dorothy Allison an American writer, speaker, and member of the Fellowship of Southern Writers\n\nEmma Burstall, the English author\'s, latest book, The Darling Girls explores the lives of three women held together by a common relationship- a man shared by all three.\n\nSynopsis:\nThree women, one man, and a tangle of lies.\n\nWhen the world famous music conductor Leo Bruck dies suddenly, the three women who loved him meet for the first time at his graveside.\n\nVictoria, his partner of twenty years and mother of two of his children; Maddy, mother of Leos daughter Phoebe; and twenty-four year old Cat. Can these three very different women, whose lives become inextricably bound, break free from the masterful control Leo exerts - even from the grave - once and for all?\n\nCat, Victoria and Maddy shared the same man in their lives- two was Leo\'s mistress and one was Leo\'s unmarried partner and what was common between them- Leo used to address them all as his "Darling Girls", but on the day of Leo\'s funeral, their perfectly loving worlds collide, crash and shatter forever, thus leaving them heart-broken for the rest of their lives, when they realize that they were all his "darling girls- instead of the one darling girl!" Hatred, rage and jealously were their first reaction towards each other, but when more of Leo\'s lies started to formulate in their lives, they gradually started to trust each other, hence Leo\'s lies might have ruined their love and trust towards Leo, but his lies brought together three very different women and ultimately friendship.\n\nThis is Burstall\'s third novel and in this novel, the author crafted a story about infidelity and how it ruins someone\'s life. And we see the story from the eyes of the victims to infidelity by the world famous music conductor, Leo. How he used them because of his own personal needs and in that way forgetting that he was actually hurting them, instead of making them happy. I loved the first chapter how compassionately the author brought together the three women of Leo\'s lives together on the day of his funeral, my heart ached for them at that moment! I loved Burstall\'s writing style, from the first page, I felt myself absorbing deeply into her story. Moreover, the friendship that the author featured in this story between three different women is absolutely lovely and sweet and something to cherish for.\n\nWhat I couldn\'t come to terms with the story was the plot- as I was reading, I felt something was going to happen- something major especially about Leo, but unfortunately the plot felt very monotonous in the mid-way, in fact the prologue sounds really intriguing, but while reading the book, I never felt that the prologue was anyway justified in the story. Moreover, I can\'t picture or draw Leo\'s demeanor very well on to my mind, since the author\'s sketchy and hazy picture of Leo left me feeling that I never got to know about Leo or about his valid and strong reasons behind his infidelity and lies.\n\nThe characterization is absolutely fantastic, except Leo. The three women are equally striking and fragile at the same time and their children are something to look out for in their book, especially Victoria\'s teenager son, Ralph, and the way the author portrayed his pain due to his father\'s death is brilliant. The ups and downs in Ralph\'s life is very believable and the author featured them with enough love and compassion. The characters had their own flaws and those flaws made them perfect in a reader\'s eyes. The pain that they undergo after Leo\'s death is something really beautifully, heart-breaking and deeply moving.\n\nThe author\'s prose is crisp and clear and with such a free-flowing narrative style, I felt myself drawn to the very core of the story. The background that the author painted in the canvas of her story is very vivid and mesmerizing, and at times, I felt myself transported to those amazing locations across United Kingdom.\n\nVerdict: A really engaging book about love, loss and friendships to cherish forever!'

4	"The Cabin is another gripping horror novella by Matt Shaw in which he scares the s*** out of you in the old fashioned way, theres no gore, no extreme violence this is pure atmosphere and  psychological horror that prays on some of your inner most fears.\n\nCraig, his wife Susan and their two daughters set out for a weekend away at his Cabin, once his Fathers, hes not been there for a long time and they're hoping for a peaceful break.\n\nCraig is entertaining with a dry, sarcastic humour, his daughters Ava, at the age where Dad are we there yet is just starting to grate on his nerves and Jamie the ever sullen teenager in a permanent bad mood. Along with his wife who can seemingly sleep through anything but still provide a tongue sharp enough to quell any outburst or argument approach the trip with mixed feelings and its not long before disaster strikes.\n\nCraig is forced into staying the night at the dilapidated cabin on his own, which to add to the atmosphere is a short walk from the former Vermont Asylum, built by the patients in the late 1800s and long since abandoned. What follows is a terrifying night of panic and distress concluding in the usual WTF, jaw dropping ending."
4	'I love shift shapers books.  Werewolves, tigers, leopards, they are all my favorites.  Wereleper is different than the others that I have read before.  This is a story, not just a hot sex, killing for blood, and running through the woods story.  There is love, fear of love, romance, families, and so much more.  It is the story of a misfit trying to find her place in the world and being afraid to settle down.\n\nMacKenzie is a wereleper.  She is not quite a leopard, not quite anything.  Then she meets Ramone.  Ramone understands Mac.  His job is to keep her safe, per her fathers orders.  Of course, it is not that easy.  The unknown forces that want Mac dead are not willing to give up and Mac is pretty stubborn.  Both Mac and Ramone have to give up certain things and ideas to keep each other out of harms way.  Opening their lives and hearts to each other is not as easy as it could be.  Both are afraid to get hurt.\n\nThis is my first book by Author Dina Haynes.  I enjoyed every page.  I loved that it was a story; it pulled me in from the first page and kept me entertained from the very first page until the very last word.  I definitely recommend checking out this series.'

3	"Nothing bad about it, but I didn't love anything about it either. I actually liked the secondary love story going on better than the main one."
3	"Where do I begin. The story begins with Misty having been in a car accident and is recused by first responder Aaron who she is attracted to and his attracted to her. Her sister comes to supposedly help her after the accident, which I didn't understand since Misty drove them to the market and pushed the shopping cart, and cooked later. What was her sister helping with.\n\nThis story stories premise was cute. It contained a lot of sex, which I usually appreciate, but it seemed gratuitous is some places without enough substance around it. If the author had gone for a longer story, maybe the characters would have been more alive. As it was, I didn't car about any of them, especially not the hero.\n\nMisty and Aaron get into physical relation early and loved is professed early. In fact every happened so soon, it was unbelievable. The other unbelievable aspect of the story is that Aaron is rich and volunteering as a first responder. I think he being a firefighter is enough without making him rich. Do one or the other please.\n\nThroughout the short, short story, the dialog was contrived, and insincere. Also the multiple sub-plots in such a short story was a bit distracting.\n\nSPOILER: Misty's response to her sister's indiscretion with her ex-husband was also unbelievable. You may want to show that blood is thicker than water, but it goes both ways. and sister's wouldn't get over an ultimate betrayal like that in a day. There's obviously something wrong with their relation as sisters. In a real situation the question of it happening again would come up."

4	"Whetjer it is a short story, a novella, or a novel, you can always depend on Mr. King to come through.  This story moves well, and I did not see the ending coming at all.  I can't wait for my next fix of Stephen King."
3	'A little hard to get a clear prospective on what was going on at times.'
4	'Ok...so this was kind of an odd story.  It was funny and yet confusing sometimes.  Like this guy I mean we know who he is and what he does but we don\'t know what draws him to her.  Why he cares so much about her down on her luckiness lately.  Not sure of his motives.  Kinda made me think he was using her as an excuse to do some "breaking the law" antics.  I mean he likes her and thats obvious but it was just such a strange chemistry between them.  I really laughed and it was just one of those odd stories and you don\'t quite get but was an ok story.'
4	'I love the price for so many practice CARS passages.\nHowever, I was under the impression that I would get books as well because I wanted to have them to highlight.\n\nI read the 30 days practice online and it has definitely opened up my eyes to the problems I was having answering CARS'
4	'The author exposes the laziness of the believer in tending to keeping a pure heart.  He also provides solutions and encouragement.  A fine resource.'
3	"Would benefited the reader to have had several editorial comments.  Had I not heard lectures on the book, I would've felt lost."

3	"When reading this don't expect any kind of detailed information regarding the inner workings of how the Special Operations of the three countries work.  this is more of an essay on each countries need for special forces.  However it is well written."
2	"I didn't really care for this book. The best part for me was Harry, Clara's assistant. There was a lot of sex, some BDSM, a lot of sex, but I never really felt the chemistry between Luca and Clara as a couple.\n\nThere were many things going on in this book that didn't seem to fit together. Luca crashing through a window. The MMA theme. The confusion for me about whether it was Clara who owned the land, or the university. The mob, Clara's very wealthy family. Then, the murder mystery.\n\nI still don't know why Clara's wealth, or her family's wealth was included. It all was too much and a little confusing. The title threw me off too. Would not have associated it with the actual storyline. I'm assuming the tycoon was Luca. I won't go into any additional detail so that I can avoid spoiler alerts.  I recommend you give it a try. Many people really enjoyed it. This one just didn't do much for me.\n\nI received this book as an ARC in exchange for an honest review."
4	"It's very informative.  and as I get use to the kindle I understand it better, but I have to first search to see how everything works and then verify it with the book"
4	'Loved this book, made me want to read the series.'
3	'The book gives an overview of body language. Can be useful as an introduction of the subject, but still very shallow to really help analyze people.'
1	'Unfortunately, I\'ll still have to keep waiting.\n\nThere is nothing worth your time and money here. This book is extremely short. The discussion of "strategy" is limited to a few paragraphs, and even those are of little value. There is no discussion whatsoever of the laws of probability and how they apply to the game. As if that weren\'t bad enough, the "glossary" is basically worthless as well. It\'s mildly amusing to read *once* but that\'s it. Nor do the very limited rule modifications given add anything of value -- strategy or otherwise -- to the game.\n\nExtremely disappointing. Don\'t waste your money.\n\n04/02/11\n\nI wish a single one of the FOUR yes. count\'em FOUR people who actually gave this thing FIVE stars would tell me ONE SINGLE THING this adds to actually playing the game.\n\nI understand it is supposed to be "Tongue in Cheek". I GET THAT.\n\nThe problem is the book\'s description which says: "tips on strategy...adding the strategic challenges that an adult can truly enjoy".\n\nThere is all of two paragraphs on the first part and even that is just plain WRONG.\n\nAs far as the second part there is zero, nada, zilch, yes you read that right NOTHING WHATSOEVER OF THE SORT in this book.\n\nI do not appreciate being ripped off in this manner, and if you don\'t either then don\'t buy the book. Or if you\'re going to give it a glowing review based on something it supposedly adds to the game then at least do the rest of us the courtesy of letting us in on the little secret. Because frankly, I\'ve read and re-read this book and I STILL don\'t see where it is....'
3	'I struggled between three or four stars here... went with just "It\'s okay".  The Naturalist tells of of Theodore Roosevelt\'s interest in nature and how it evolved from a hobby of collecting animal samples to his development as an avid hunter.  Much of the book accounts for Roosevelt\'s many hunting expeditions and how that shaped his contributions to the naturalist movement.  Although Roosevelt is known as a conservationist spurring the creation of the US Forest Service and national parks, the book is a more detailed record of grand hunts than a political record.  I received this book from Blogging for Books in exchange for this honest review, and while I appreciated the perspective and photos included in this book, it just wasn\'t the fully-rounded profile I was expecting, though it is well-researched and adds many details to Roosevelt\'s biography.'
2	"I like the premise of the rake and well-meaning miss, but I did not remotely see any connection between the H and h.  It told me what they felt, instead of building any basis for those feelings.  She was intrigued, then he was intrigued, then he can't stop thinking of her so he must love her, and b/c he loves her, she must love him?  Uhh, no.  Not believable."
3	"Steamy, tantalizing and undeniable passion! This read is short but keeps your attention on the combustible passion this couple's shares."
4	'Having to read such a magnificent book like this really satisfies my soul specially during my rest day from work. Having a rough road in life like this is a great challenge but sometimes one may collapse if they cannot handle the pressure that life brings on to them. I love this book because of how inspiring the story is and it reflects how difficult life is that we must be strong to survive. I have learned so many lessons in this book and it teaches me how to handle difficult times even when I am at my lowest point.'
4	'This book was informative and written well. I gave it a 4 out of 5 rating because the author could have elaborated more on the steps to follow to accomplish the goal. He did give good information that was added on after the end of the book. I would recommend this book.'
4	"Every so often I come across a book that has such a unique concept underlying the plot that I simply can't wait to read it. Almost Amish is such a book, as I absolutely love the idea of a reality TV series about living like the Amish, a plot I found myself imagining myself living within numerous times throughout the story. I found myself thinking about how I would respond if I had to suddenly learn to cook on a wood stove or wash clothes without electricity. Would I retain a spirit of gratitude or would I get grumpy? How would I get along with my family, with my children?\n\nKathryn Cushman is a skilled author who immerses the reader into the world of her characters with seeming ease and fills her story with deep emotions. Her characters are utterly realistic, which actually caused me to dislike Susan for much of the story with her perfectionist nature and her constant harping on the others to work harder and help Susan get the acclaim she sought. However, this made her moment of triumph later on in the story all the sweeter. I really liked the character of Julie, with her soft heart who was struggling to understand what gifts God had uniquely gifted her in. I left the story pondering my own gifts and my own calling in this world. Almost Amish is a powerful reminder of what really matters in this world, not running around and worrying about exterior things, but living a life that focuses on faith and family and learning to say no to the less important things in life.\n\nI strongly recommend this book, and give this book 4 out of 5 stars.\n\nBook has been provided courtesy of Baker Publishing Group and Graf-Martin Communications, Inc. Available at your favourite bookseller from Bethany House, a division of Baker Publishing Group."
4	'Loved the characters and the story line was very good. The story felt rushed though. It would have been much better as a longer novel.'
4	'A very well written and interesting series. I enjoyed the twist in the story line and the characters are well written and interesting. The author keeps your interest in what is going on and what might happen. Each story continues well into the next.'
1	'Very minimal information. Apparently you need to buy another book to get details. This book just tells you where to line up. waste of money.'

The family does not have the money for treatment so she signs up for a sugar daddy. Hugo live in England and lives like a hermit but in the lap of luxury. He contacts Monica and the suspense begins. This book is well written with an interesting plot. I received this book free in exchange for an honest review.'
3	'I really like this story as much as there was of it, but it felt like I only got to read the first chapter.  Where the hell is the rest of the story?  I was left hanging waiting for it to continue.  The author has some original and unique ideas about what seems like a nonviolent alien race of intelligent beings.  I could easily see this story develop and run from 150 to 200 pages. Ms. Wells, please develop this story, it could be a really good one.'
4	'A hot enticing filled with orgasm after orgasm book! Loved it! Will definitely pock up the other books in the series'
4	'Very enjoyable reading, I liked the continuing theme of suspicion on so many.  It was a bit too much of the same clues while trying to find the murderer.  I would recommend the book to other mystery lovers.'

4	'[...]\nI was given an advanced copy of this book to write an honest review for Netgalley and Cocktails and Books.\nThis is the second book in the Wicked Horse series and if you read the first book in this series, you know this is an incredibly hot, erotic series.  The Wicked Horse is a sex club where members can live out any fantasy.  I loved the first book about Woolf and Callie and in this story, we learn about Cain Bonham.  Cain, a former marine enjoys working as head of security at the Wicked Horse.  He loves sex and is in high demand as a fantasy maker.\nSloane is an undercover reporter sent to the Wicked Horse to uncover a story about corruption in the Governors office.  Sloane decides to seduce Cain to try and get some information.  From the moment Cain and Sloane meet there is explosive chemistry between them and they are open to try anything.  However, there are secrets between them and they have to decide how much they are willing to share.\nSawyer Bennett is a talented author with a great voice.  She is one of my go to authors and I enjoy whatever she writes.  She does a great job with this series; she is able to write a believable, sensual story with realistic characters including lots of sex, kink and multiple partners.  I love this series and I cant wait to Bridgers story, he intrigues me and I am sure his story will be interesting.'
1	'This has to be worst spelling edited book I have ever read. When I reach 20, I stopped counting.\n\nLast I heard there has been no name change for GOD, and in a religious book, one would think the spelling of the name would not be "COD". Yet it happened in this book numerous times.\n\nIt\'s a very tough topic to present to begin with, the horrible amount of misspelled words doesn\'t help.\nOnce I start reading a book, and I am an avid reader, I rarely put it down and go read another one for awhile. I found I did this often with this book.\n\nAlso did not like no page number location and this is a realtively new book.\n\nI would not buy it again, nor recommend it until the book is copy edited - and evne then I wouldn\'t praise it.'

2	". . . to become a legionnaire in an army where his father is a general, to prove himself to his brother legionnaires, to find out truth about his general father who he hasn't seen in years.  He is making fast progress on the first two, but then he is selected for a mission whose purpose is not revealed.  Then his father and his brother legionnaires are betrayed by a disgraced legionnaire, then the barbarian Woades attack, then he struggles to survive and find some of the reasons behind what his father was apparently doing with two large chests of gold and a large cache of silver.  Primus doesnt find out in this installment; nor does the reader.  Though other reviewers feel this book stands out, they're hooked and waiting for the next installment, that next installment isn't where Im going.  I somewhat regret having bought both Legionnaire and Protge at the same time before Id read either one.  I guess as one reviewer says each novel can be read independently, standing by itself, so I would add that each can fall by itself.  Perhaps Primus and Lilith (from Protge) could share their confusions and begin to make some sense of their situations.  But that idea is simply pure speculation."
3	'I just bought a Kindle and the first thing I downloaded was the NET Bible (Noteless).  I love the translation, but the Kindle version does not have a quick way to navigate to books, chapters, or verses.  If you "Search" for a book title you can find the books that way.  You can also search for the "Contents" and go to the Table of Contents, then use the hyperlinks to go to a particular book.\n\nThe \'Standard\' Kindle \'Table of Contents\' feature is grayed out, meaning it is unavailable.\n\nThe highest and best use of this download is to use it to simple read through the Bible.  It holds your last page and resumes where ever you left off, so it\'s good if you just want to read through.'

4	"Ty and Cassie are thrown together due to very unfortunate circumstances. Ella is the little girl stuck in the middle, and no matter how stubborn both Ty and Cassie can be, they both just want what's best for Ella.\nI really enjoyed this story. Ty and Cassie were great characters, and both were very strong and determined. Ty has more of a controlling streak, but he means well and has a heart of gold.\nI'm looking forward to reading more about Wishing, Texas as the people there seem so fun already."

4	'Enjoyed it'
4	'The photos accompanying the text in this reader are delightful; and the print is large and easy for youngsters to read.  The book is loaded with interesting information; any child would enjoy learning about foals and their mothers.\n\nHowever, I have to agree with an earlier reviewer (C. Scanlon) that the complexity of the sentences can be a barrier to reading.  Fortunately, the photos are well-matched to the text and that will help children understand what they read.'

4	'This is a prequel of sorts for Anni Antoni\'s excellent Urbsn Guardians books. I\'ve read those and truly enjoyed them (and definitely recommend them, by the way), so I couldn\'t pass this one up. I\'m glad I didn\'t do so. While short this book really is fun, fun, fun, and full of all the things that make her books so enjoyable. A "must" read for fans of Anni Antoni. For others highly recommended but with a warning: you\'ll probably feel the urge to get more of her (longer) books after finishing this fine appetizer.'

3	"I used to have a similar game on an old palm pilot.  I wished I could find that exact game but I don't remember it's name.  It is similar to Bubble Pop.  You could actually get rid of all the bubbles if you were good.  It was a little more fun.  This game drops bubbles at the end so you really can't have a strategy."
4	'I previously read and enjoyed "the Evermen Saga" by the author, and was intrigued by this book\'s premise. Like the beginning of almost any series, I found it a little slow at the start while this world was being set up. I thought it picked up about 100 pages in, and I was more engaged in the story. Chloe and Dion became more interesting as the book went on. I felt like Chloe was pretty flat in the beginning, but she improved and I hope she continues to develop in the next book. I found Dion pretty interesting early on, and I am looking forward to seeing where his story goes.'

4	"This 14-page e-book covers 14 body parts for toddlers to learn. It covers teeth, shoulders, Eyes, Nose, neck, mouth, legs, knees, hair, foot, ears, arms, stomach and chin.  The e-book is set up so that it has the name of the body part and then it has a picture of the body part. Each picture of the body part displays a child either pointing to the body part or smiling for example and showing their teeth. The first page of the book has 3 drawings of children and has each body part labeled and covers more than the book does. For example these drawings cover your eyebrows, toes, hand, chest, and forehead which is not displayed in the book.  The pictures are cute and I like the fact that they use real children so that children can relate to the pictures in the book. I use this book with my two-year-old and we practice looking at the picture and then pointing to our body parts. Overall I think the book is really great and it's an important subject to teach your toddlers. When a toddler can name his body parts it makes it much easier when they get hurt or they're sick to be able to tell you they fell and hurt their knee or their stomach aches. As a parent and a preschool teacher I can appreciate the importance of a book that teaches body parts. The only Improvement I can find for this book is to make a clearly defined end page, so that when your child gets to the last page of the book it's not a blank white page for them to keep swiping.\n******Disclaimer I received this e-book for free in exchange for reviewing purposes.*****"
4	'Complimentary copy provided in exchange for honest review.\n\nWell, this is a twist on human trafficking! This can be read as a standalone, but to get a better sense of Aria you really should read&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Degrade-Flawed-Book-1/dp/B014NUJROM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Degrade (Flawed Book 1)</a>. Aria is a very strong and independent woman who zero desire for a HEA.\n\nMika on the other hand, knows all about Aria and her career choice (if you will), but he believes he can convince her they can have a HEA. I will say that Mika has some creepy tendencies when it comes to Aria, but hey, this is a dark story, so why wouldn\'t someone be all creepy?\n\nThe sexual tension is great, the sexuals are freakin\' hot, but there are a few moments that happen where it\'s not all dark and perverse. I won\'t say they\'re happy times, but they do lighten the tone a bit. I did find myself rolling my eyes sometimes, but only because both Aria and Mika had me frustrated (like I tend to do with my tween daughter). Overall the story flowed at a great pace, you got enough of an explanation without being mired down by mundane details, and the secondary characters were a great enhancement to the book. I\'m hoping we get a book about Sarena and Dominic soon.'

4	'Somewhere around a 3.5. I definitely don\'t think it\'s some of Mira Grant\'s best work, but it\'s a nice wrap-up to the entire Newsflesh series. Unlike the previous two novellas, this one takes place after the events of the three novels-- about two years after, to be more specific. The world is changing because of the end events of Blackout, but those changes are coming slowly. In this novella, we travel Down Under with Mahir to learn about Australia\'s unique approach to dealing with zombies and nature conservancy. There isn\'t really a driving plot [well, they do drive... a lot... but that\'s not what I mean] and it\'s mostly an outsider\'s observations of a different country and their ways. The "meat" of the book doesn\'t really appear until about 3/4 of the way in. Still, it\'s entertaining and worth the purchase if only for a few more answers. I expected more from Mira Grant for this novella but, expectations aside, it was still an entertaining and quick read. Just, compared to her other works, it falls a little short.'

4	'Great introduction for the beginner gardener.'
4	"I'll first say that I found it a little bit difficult to get into the story at first. Mainly because I felt like the pieces of background offered were a bit fragmented. However, it was definitely worth the read because once I started putting things together, I was able to connect better with Isabella as a character. I was gripped by the suspense and intrigued by this alternate-reality world where wizards are used on both sides. I thought that Isabella's desire for a normal life made her a sympathetic character. The secondary characters were colorful and engaging. I was entertained and left looking forward to the second book in this trilogy!"
3	'I feel this could have been longer and developed the relationship more (and the characters). The storyline was decent and I liked the setting. It just seemed rushed.'
4	"Fun first book of the series. Light, easy summer read. JRT's are always up to something after all, aren't they?"
3	"Interesting book. It was a cross between the movie Click where the main character enters the tv and Jumanji with all the weird characters roaming around and creating havoc. During the beginning of the book I kept wanting to just delete it and move onto something more interesting, but then curiosity got the best of me and I finally finished. It was interesting how the authors` minds worked, but I would say this was a book a didn't need to spend the day reading. The good part is that there are not a lot of typos like some of the free and reduced price books for the Kindle. Okay, but not a great book."
4	'Good book and really enjoyed reading it and like how the characters developed a friendship first before a relationship. Also like how the author used religion throughout the book and brought both leads to a higher power, which in turned showed them all things are possible. Will be reading the next book.'

Her characters in Dangerous Secret, Abigail and Ryan are intriguing from the get go. The instant attraction that they share is shaded by suspicion on Abigail's part as to whether this handsome young man who is her boss is somehow involved in her father's death.\n\nAbigail is determined to solve her father's murder, but is her lover a suspect?\n\nI enjoyed Dangerous Secret very much and wish Ms Lauryn luck with her future books from this wonderful series, Pinnacles of Power. 4 STARS"

So far, I have read every Charles Todd book and I plan to continue reading them as they come out.'
2	'It seemed like a good premise, but the Jason seemed wildly different as an adult than as a child. That was a continuity issue for me. I wish that it had been more heartfelt. I get that they had a physical connection, but I have no idea why he fell in love with her. Oddly it seemed like he was simply longing for a simpler past than the actual girl. Overall, disappointed.'

4	'I thought this book was cute.  The author did a great job of showing how we can conceive notions of people without knowing them.  The two leading characters were fairly well fleshed out by the author for a short story.  I enjoyed reading this book and would read more by this author.'
4	"I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review through the Goodreads Don't Buy Me Love program.\n\nLancelot du Lac has come to challenge King Claudas in order to win back his fathers lands that King Claudas took from him. Claudas has seen something in the way Lancelot looks at Arthur that makes him wonder. So Claudas ends up eventually having his way with Lancelot. Its dubcon but Lancelot does like it. Being the noble knight Lancelot is and bound to Arthur, Lancelot spends the entire story tormented over his desire for Claudas, his enemy. Claudas obsession with Lancelot grow throughout the story. They are forced through circumstances to be together and even though Lancelot is fighting it, they always end up in bed together. The sex is always rough with an edge of dubcon. I did get the sense they were falling for each other but because they were on the opposite sides of allegiance, it wasn't possible for them to be any more to each other than what they were. There were other characters introduced, Morgana Le Fay who worked with Loth to in her revenge against King Arthur for taking her son, Mordred, from her. There was mention of other Arthurian characters too.\n\nI liked the relationship between Lancelot and Claudas. The chase, and push and pull felt real. The ending isn't a happily ever after but with this story I don't think they can have a happily ever after. At least not at this stage of the way things are in their lives. While I was fine with things being left open as they were between Lancelot and Claudas, I did feel like there was a bit of a plot hole with Morganas revenge plans against Arthur. Whats going to happen with that? Even with the very last line of the book it seems like this one has been set up for a sequel. I hope it has one. Ill be reading it if it does."
3	"This book is yet another in the survivalist genre with decent action and ideas in the beginning. SPOILER ALERT; The author decides to end the book before the protagonist gets home. He just leaves us about half way home, wounded and with a banjo playing hick that may not have the resources to help. There is a second banjo hick but he doesn't have strings on his instrument. I have looked for a second book as a conclusion but Frank may have dug too deep of a hole to get out of no matter how bad he wants to go home."

4	'Wow, this was a real page-turner! Even though this was just the first part of this series and it was a quick read it felt full of intrigue and unexpected twists, not to mention it was super sexy-hot!\n\n"There is only so much rejection a man can take before he finally just gives into temptation."\n\nBefore I comment further I have to warn you there\'s cheating on this story but this author pulls it off in such a way that you most likely won\'t feel bad for the characters at all. I personally didn\'t and I don\'t usually like cheating on my stories but here, I actually liked it. Seeing the characters doing "wrong" like that it felt good for reasons the story itself provides. Furthermore, such lies create a ripple effect that brings juicy drama, suspense, and lots of tension to an already intriguing story. Something else I think was a big factor of the awesome execution of this plot is that it\'s told in three different POVs (all characters in the triangle) and so I got everybody\'s perspective on their own actions and wishes which made me understand a lot even when other parts still remained a mystery...\n\n"I care for my wife, I do, but I honestly don\'t know how much more of this I can take. Being alone. Feeling abandoned. Feeling like Im always wrong."\n\nI really look forward to seeing what happens on book two of this series! I want my questions answered and I hope I continue to be on Team Griffin Boyd because he was my character, unless the author surprises me yet again with more amazing hot-deception and everything takes a different turn which I wouldn\'t mind at all because I love the twists! :D'
4	'This is indeed one out of a few Christian books on spiritual marriage that is really helpful.\nIt is an eye opener and a must-read book.'
3	'I liked the topics...very well researched. But I couldn\'t get past "chakra" being spelled as CHARKA. I would recommend this.'
4	"Not quite the best I've read, but I loved the character\ndevelopment in the tradition of Jack Ryan/Tom Clancy.\n\nI wish he would have made this story line into 4 or 5 books and\nnot just two."
1	'A very light book, giving you just the bare basics about gardening.  Not worth the current price of $4.'
4	'Copy courtesy of Netgalley\nHEA complete with a little epilogue.\nI have read all three books from this series. I have to say that Crushed is my favorite. The story was kind of predictable but really good. It held my attention until the last page. The characters were well developed and interesting. Chloe was my favorite. Everyone should have a friend like her. She was sweet, caring, stubborn and absolutely hilarious. it was fun watching Michael try to figure her out in the beginning. Actually it fun watching them try to figure each other out. I liked how Michael could see The swan in Chloe before she became a swan. They start out as frenemies and slowly move to friendship and further. The plot is simple but complicated. just a all around fun read.'
4	'God wants His people to keep pressing on even when the trials of life come and we want to focus on our own lives.  God has a plan for each one of us and for His Kingdom.  We have a call on our lives to do the work of the Lord and to build the house of the Lord.'
4	"This was a pretty good quick read. I'm not sure if I will continue with the other books in the series just because this wasn't my favorite."
4	"Reviewing the Kindle free edition.\n\nTruck drivers in space?  Space exploration becomes the domain of the lowest common denominator in this sly tale of a couple of 'over the road' type space jockeys on a big specimen-gathering job.  Somogyi's humor is subtle at first and then he whacks you on the head with a hilarious twist!  This was a lot of fun to read."
4	"I liked this story it was a good book.  There was a lot of sex scenes in the story and I felt we didn't need so much.  Yes I said that. There could have been more of a plot and a little less sex scenes. I think the writer is very good at bringing you into the story and making you feel as though you are there up close. Takes a very good writer to do that."
4	'cool. but no idea why it is a classic. I mean it is a good book with symbolism and what not but that in no way should qualify it as required reading for high school students in California. Just plain arbitrary in my honest opinion'
4	"So refreshing to read a book that didn't need editorial scrubbing. This author knew what they were doing. Liked the story."
4	"When one first looks at this book title, they might think it's like a Cliff Notes to the books, but instead it's something to use if you're going to use these books in a classroom setting. For that purpose it is very good."
3	'I loved the characters and it started mysterious. It had a intriguing beginning but the story was very short it could have been the first three volumes as one book and been more satisfying. The way it is in these min versions and takes to long to get to any answers I was bored with it by the third volume. The characters are really great though and I liked the writing for the most part it just took to long to get anywhere and lost my interest.'
2	"I like romance novels and understand they're highly unrealistic... But this one was just really over the top. Everything is perfect? A guy who is cheesier, mushier, more sentimental and heck, verbose than the girl? If a man started saying those things, I would think he's scary and doesn't have much of a life... not romantic...\n\nSure, a guy can express his feelings but this book was a real waste of time (and yes, I finished it anyway because I was hoping for some sort of redemption)"
1	"Too many incongruities, unbelievable circumstances.  A sniper is after her and she goes running alone? She says she loves him to his face and then hopes he doesn't know. Edit."
4	"I still feel masons book was definitely the of the 4 stories but I still enjoyed them all the same. Definitely give this series a read u won't regret it"
4	'Book one slow starter to establish plot and characters. Then accelerates revealing more character depth as a he reader learns more about what got them to this point in the series. I am hooked into where it goes from here.'
4	'A different location than the other three Raine western books I have read but well described never the less.  Interesting plot with his typical mostly unpredictable twists and subplots.  He retained me enough to read yet another of his stories so to that this must be a positive recommendation.'
4	'A fun read with a few twists and turns, especially if you love cats.'
1	'What a waste if money and time'
3	'I really enjoyed this book until about halfway through. I had figured it out who the "bad guy" was almost immediately as the author seems to make it a point to specifically mention certain occurrences, but I thought the writing was good and the story was fun (thus the three stars) so I kept reading. It was about 3/4 of the way in that I just couldn\'t deal with it anymore; the characters were just TOO STUPID. Good Lord! I usually love regency romance novels, and I always enjoy a good retelling of a classic story, but I think it\'s so frustrating when they make the characters so dang dumb, like there was no common sense or basic problem solving during that time period. I thought it started so well and was looking forward to reading the other stories surrounding the characters that were introduced, but now I think I\'ll skip reading about the other dumb-dumbs.'
4	"The final book in the series, and if you have enjoyed the journey so far, you'll enjoy this.  There is plenty of action, which is expected, and more of the philosophical stuff that was started in the previous couple of books.  The ending was a little generic and cliche, and some of the characters motivations are a little shallow, but I felt the journey was half the fun and the journey over the series has been one hell of a ride.  If you're a fan of the series, read this to see the conclusion."
4	'Some very useful information. Thanks for writing this, as it gave me a lot of ideas and encouragement. Also quite a few typos, which makes me a little skeptical of how much multi-level marketing you can do -- podcast, pdf, book, etc.-- and still have a polished, professional product at each level.'
4	"Simply a great story, Can't wait to find out what happens next."
4	"I found this book an easy read. It was over quicker than I expected. But was perfect because I don't have time for a long book."
4	'As with all of Ms. Atkins books, I read it from first page and stopped at last page in one sitting.  I like her clear way of writing where Ido not have to funnel through any nonsense filler.\n\nThe characters were likable from the beginning  The hero a detective and a father who is given the custody of his son because his ex-wife is ambitious for acting.\nThe heroine, vulnerable to the dirty fiance she once loved, a mystery her memory reveals the trouble she is in, to a woman willing to give love a good chance with the right guy.\n\nThe only reason Ms. Atkins did not receive a five star review is due to the quick attraction and commitment the main characters felt and the painful injuries of the heroine should have been more convincing.  Case in point - her leaving the hospital and fighting the bad guys, I would have been in traction.  One last thing she and the child instantly bonded which quickly formed a family outcome.\n\nAll in all a delightful read and look forward to more adventures from the creative mind and talented writing of Melanie Atkins.'
1	'all it is is a bunch of ugly pictures and they are all of the same things! horrible! like 0 stars!!!!!! i really think that nobody should buy this even though its free! it is a waste of time!!!!'
4	"I really enjoyed this collection of stories. The longer ones at the end were even more engrossing since I was better able to live in their world.\nThe best part may be the origin stories for these tales. It's fascinating to hear where, when and why each story was written. Nothing is created in a vacuum and it was fun to get a glimpse into where each story came from."
4	"These three seem like a match made in heaven. I'm so glad they were able to come together and figure it out. He impressed me with his dedication to family not only by taking care of his younger siblings but the way he took on the role of father as well."
1	'She needs an English class. A fine example of poor writing. She needs to back to school and pay attention this time!'
4	'The story is very interesting. The style varies from a slow meditatve pace to a rapid sequence of events. It would have been nice to have the small pictures that were included in the original version and in pdf form for free somewhere else. The merit is the popularity of this book which gives some insight into the 19th century ways of life, which in some aspects is quite modern!'
3	'Wish on the dips they would have included what a serving size was.  Overall, interesting recipes.  Gave me some good ideas.'
4	'I really like this series.  This was a great addition.'
2	"I got this in exchange for a review!\n\nI just couldn't get into his book, I see all the great reviews that it has gotten and guess I need to shelf it and come back at a later date. At this time though I only give it a two."
3	'I enjoyed this book.  However, the plot is very slow to me in this book.  Also I hated the way the book just ended.  This is a story about a person in a Relationship for  five years and new her fianc was a whore monger.  Met her best friends friend at her wedding and fell love with him.'
4	'This is a very well formatted volume of the Conan Doyle tales.  My only wish was that some of the illustrations would have been included such as in The Dancing Men.  When the story itself tells you to look at a map or at some illustration and that is not provided it leaves you with a poor impression.  Thankfully there are only a few examples of this.'
3	"Sleep Donation is a novella that theorizes what our world might look like if faced with a disease of terminal insomnia. The CDC is searching for answers but no one knows exactly what causes it or why some people are affected and others aren't. A company called Slumber Corps collects sleep donations from the unaffected and distributes them to the sleep deprived. Instead of Red Cross vans collecting blood, there are Sleep Vans collecting hours of sleep.\n Trish Edgewater works for the Slumber Corps. She is their best recruiter. Her sister died of insomnia before the sleep donation procedure was developed and Trish resurrects her ghost to persuade people to save others by donating their sleep. But Trish gradually becomes uncomfortable with the absolutes her company claims. And when Trish recruits (through her parents) Baby A, the first ever universal donor, she begins to question her beliefs even more. She starts to question the ethics of her bosses & their company.\n This book was ok. I admit, I find novellas less appealing than full length novels. I prefer to get deeper into the story and world building. But, the story was interesting and it kept my attention. It was a creative and new idea. And the disease sort of made sense, with all the electronics and distractions, people do have trouble sleeping. What if there was a disease where you couldn't sleep at all. What lengths would people go to in an effort to find a cure? And what or who would they be willing to sacrifice?\n\nI really wanted to see what would happen next. It felt like the whole story was building to something that you didn't get to see. So the end was a bit disappointing."
4	'A love story between a young man who works in the Tower of London and a childhood friend who is believed to be a witch.'
4	'this book was to much back and forth break up get back together to hard to follow still a great book though!'
4	"I'm going with 4 stars because of the author's technique of telling the story from the viewpoint of both the hero and the heroine. The dual voices worked for me, and made the lack of back story a little easier to accept. The novella format makes in depth character studies difficult, but the glimpse into the primary couple's minds made it easier for me to connect. The story itself is well conceived and crafted. Kerri carpenter writes with passion and skill; well balanced, evenly paced, beautifully detailed settings and crisp, witty dialogue made this a fast, fun read.\n*I received my copy through NetGalley.com in exchange for an honest review."
1	"W real short story but also o very interesting.  My grandson said that's all there is?  Of course he didn't want to ho to bed. Yet."
2	"Very quick read. Didnt love it. But didn't hate it either. Wont be reading the next book in this series."
4	"Wanting Reed started off slow for me and I did struggle a little to keep going. I just felt like I was never going to get to a part that was going to hook me in and keep me going. The story seemed long and some parts could have been kept out. Tyler, I love me some Tyler. I have rooted for him since book 1 and he still has my heart! Reed, I am kind of over him and the new guy, YES there is a new guy! But he didn't do much for me. I loved Breaking Elle and needed to know what happened because the author left us with such a major cliffhanger. You will understand if you have already read Breaking Elle or you will once you finish it! I give this book 3.5 stars!\n\n-Harper"
4	"I'm going to let you in on a (not so secret) secret. I'm sappy! I love romance, happily ever afters, puppies, kitties, hot cocoa, warm fuzzies, etc. AND, I love Christmas. As a natural result of this combo, I'm a total sucker for the Hallmark Channel, particularly the Christmas movies. I love them! I have seen most of them, several times. Unexpectedly Yours is like a sexed-up-Hallmark-Movie in book form. AND, I totally mean that as a compliment! <3\n\nSophie is sweet and slightly damaged with big dreams and expectations for a perfect Christmas in New York City. Austin is a rockstar on holiday looking for a little R&R who finds more than he ever expected in sweet, sincere and suddenly available Sophie. When they're together, Sophie can embrace a carefree spirit she rarely shows and Austin wants to make all of her holiday dreams come true. Can they last through Christmas, what about beyond?\n\nIts romantic and steamy and flirts with happily ever after. Unexpectedly Yours is a fun little story that's perfect for the season and worth a couple of hours on the couch, by the fire, wrapped in your favorite blanket with a cup of cocoa!"
2	"This book is not as good as the previous 2.  I am having a hard time getting through it.  Maybe I should wait until I finish, but I can't focus enough to finish it."
4	"I would give this book a 4.5. Short of a 5 only by one issue I hope I can sort out shortly. I'm on day 6 of the sleep training with my 7 month old and the improvement is notorious. He goes to sleep at 7 pm every nap and stays asleep until 5:30 at the earliest. Nap time had also improved dramatically. Still, the training is in progress, but the results are already there."
4	'~~~\n\nPrepare to:\n\n-Fall hard for Gordon!\n---Be teased to near death!\n------Get completely sucked into this raw world!\n\nNEED MORE!!!!!\n\nIn a nutshell this is a dark, raw romance that has intriguing chemistry between the two main characters. This world is uncomfortably similar to our own, but just edgy enough to keep you off center. I loved the relationship development, ensuing mysteries behind every character and the intense action scenes.\n\nConfession: I haven\'t finished reading the ICoS series. And I don\'t think it mattered one bit! I am familiar with the post-war world that Mr. Hassell and Ais created, having read Evenfall and part of Afterimage, but I\'m not an authority. After Midnight can easily be read completely apart from the ICoS series.\n\nTHE CHARACTERS\n\n  "...he was an anxious wreck most of the time; constantly frightened that his life would return to the old days. He knew Pandora just relaxed him enough to think clearly, but it still felt like magic. Rainbows and star shine and the will to keep going."\n\nGordon Frost - He seems to fall somewhere between anxious class clown and unaware genius. Okay, genius is way too strong, but he does have potential to not f* up everything. If only he could keep his mouth shut. He also has this "woe is me" thing going on, but it\'s genuine, not whiny. It just made me want to hold him.\n\n  "\'You are the most bats**t covert criminal...whatever guy, that I\'ve ever met. You just tried to choke me and now you\'re commenting that I have a fever.\'"\n  "\'I was making an observation,\'" Adam said with a defensive edge in his voice.\n  "\'Whatever, man. Just whatever.\'"\n\nAdam Blake - Typical agent. Gorgeous, deadly, dry, and so f*king sexy he crinkled the pages of my kindle. At the same time there\'s this mysteriousness about him and it\'s hard to know what makes him tick. For all that Adam was a bad*ss, he seemed so straight edge it was painful.\n\nThe relationship between Gordon and Adam is delightful. For a long time it goes something like this:\n\n  "\'Keep talking and I\'ll gag you.\'"\n  "\'Bl*w me.\'"\n\nHonestly, I really do love the chemistry between Gordon and Adam. At one point there\'s this kiss that stops a bout of hysterics that is so vivid and intense my heart cracked. That\'s when I realized just how much I was in Gordon\'s head.\n\nSide characters:\nRachel -The best friend and sexy bad*ss.\nChance - I want his story, there\'s so much more to know.\nMarquis - I don\'t even know what to think of him. He\'s a...conundrum.\nThe Twins - Scary, sexy, scary.\n\nTHE STORY\n\nIt\'s 2021 and more than ten years ago the world suffered nuclear attacks that killed untold numbers, decimating major cities and creating marked changes to the world as we know it. Survivors have found ways to endure, cope, and some, even to thrive.\n\n  "He imagined it swirling into his system and entering his bloodstream while he anticipated the next few minutes, when the effects of Pandora would kick in. Every time he popped a cap he knew what true love felt like, and every time was like the first time."\n\nDrug use is a popular coping mechanism, and luckily for Gordon he deals in the most popular drug of choice. Pandora. He partakes himself, frequently, and seems to change in front of your eyes. From self-doubting and insecure to mouthy, aware and horny, he goes through his days surviving. After a particularly bad day Gordon goes home only to be abducted.\n\n  "Sadly, the first thing to cross Gordon\'s mind was: \'Wow, he\'s pretty f*king hot.\'"\n\nMr. Greek, or Adam, as we come to know him, is an assassin for "The Agency" and always has to do what he\'s told. Except he\'s got a godd**ed conscience. The mess he finds himself in, all because of his attraction to Gordon, is a train wreck waiting to happen.\n\nFrom here on out there are people in the shadows, clear cut threats, jealousy, conspiracy theories and Gordon running for his life. Until he is caught...again.\n\n  "In the two days it took Gordon to become mobile, his paranoia had reached astronomical heights."\n\nTHE WRITING\n\nFor me, the subtle feeling of gloom in this world comes not only from the eerie similarity to our present world, but also from a less-is-more approach. Mr. Hassell has certainly tightened up his word count and made it count! Bravo.\n\nThe pacing, the controlled imagery and the character connections are very well done. Although there was a little sluggishness in the middle, and there were a few awkward passages, the ending makes up for this with blazing action and drama.\n\nUltimately it\'s very readable and engrossing. You\'ll find a clever combination of humor mixed with tension, heartache, and even subtle human messages that give poignancy and a deeper connection to the story.\n\n  "There was something special about coming so close to death and managing to escape."\n\n~ ~ ~\n\nI would like to thank Santino Hassell and Susan Lee for providing me with an ARC of this book in exchange for my honest review.\n\n~ ~ ~'
4	'I purchased this Kindle edition as a preparation for the audio drama version.  Although there are no commentaries in this edition, the price is free since volunteers provided the version for Kindle.  For background information on the play and its writing, I go to Wikipedia.\n.'
4	"if you're interested in this kind of stuff very good book..;"
1	'I bought this book for my Kindle, and returned it within 2-3 mins.  There are very few recipes in the book, and there were several spelling errors.  Yogurt is spelled yoghurt for one recipe and then spelled correctly for the next.  I noticed a few recipes indicated "a scoop" of an ingredient  to be added and then conflicting measurements were given for what a scoop was.'
2	"I used to love this series, but the last two books were a miss. The main problem with this story was that there wasn't enough conflict to keep the story going, and there are pages and pages of angst (the heroine's self doubt mostly) and lovemaking. Had this story been a 40000 word novella, it probably would have been a lot better."
1	'Very shallow analysis.  Desperate need for proof reading - confusion among presidents (FDR referred to as "Teddy") - whole bit seems sophomoric!'
4	'So many twists and turns but overall a great love story.  Once I started it was very hard to put down.'
2	"I've tried on multiple Kindles and even reported the problem. I can get to a specific verse, then Kindle stops responding. That is VERY disappointing when using this as your reference to study or follow along in church."
3	'I liked that the information in this book is easy to follow and has examples to explain in more depth.'
4	"I think this compares well against chabon's other work. I love reading the way he uses language and metaphor, and this book showcased those talents well. I enjoyed the structure of fictionalized memoir and the personal way it framed the threads of the story. Not surprisingly, this book drags at points, but once you settle in for some slower pacing it's worth it."
4	'Good read but the author jumped around and got off topic from time to time. Otherwise a very enjoyable book. Glad I took the time to read it.'
4	'The book was sometimes predictable but still a great read. The story was still fascinating. It had a lot going on and kept my interest the whole time.'
3	'Lots of "typos" but overall good. It\'s a quick read but I found it to be quite helpful for what I needed.'
4	'I have had an active interest in applying the benefits of juicing into my daily diet since January 2012 when I began a weight loss program that involved better eating, better portion control, exercise, and the increased use of fruits and vegetables in my diet.\n\nThis book is a rather well thought out well put together guide that serves as a basic introduction into the benefits as well as the draw backs of juicing.\n\nHowever, one of the main drawbacks of juicing, as noted in the book, has to do with both the increased sugar content, as well as the increased calories. While Juicing does have its benefits, juicers do not use the fiber content of the fruits and vegetables, which contain most of the nutrients that are beneficial towards both better weight loss, and better health.\n\nThis book is a great resource for me however as I can use the recipes for my own smoothies, in which 100% of the fruit/vegetables are used. They taste good, the sugar content is diluted a bit, and the fiber helps fill an empty stomach.\n\nThis is, as I said an excellent introduction into the benefits of whole foods, but stops short of delivering the full benefits by omitting the fiber vitamin content that usually ends up being thrown away when the juicer is cleaned.\n\nPerhaps expanding the book to include both options would make this an even more complete guide to better health.\n\nAll in all worth the time and the money.\n\nA well written work.'
3	"I was hoping for a better book. It just didn't hit me like the others did. I just couldn't connect.\n\nI hope there is another one out there that was almost done before Clancy died.\n\nJim\nLong-time reader and fan"
4	'A pretty good book with lots of surprises'
3	'It was good but nothing too out of the ordinary.'
4	'Good fast read. Great story. Highly recommended for lovers of American historical fiction, Abraham Lincoln and the\nCivil War. Very worth while.'

4	'What a wonderful story. I will definitely be on the lookout for more by Melissa Tagg. The characters were realistic and the story was well-written. I definitely recommend this book.'
4	"Four students who don't know each other will connect, not on purpose, on Prom night. It has finally arrived. Andrea isn't impressed with the excitement that surrounds Prom night. She only plans to go because she thinks that's what she's supposed to do. Her friend Bethanne convinced her to make a move on her long time crush Justin Sanchez. Unfortunately, Andrea won't be going to prom. Her mom found a bottle of alcohol hidden in her closet and now she is grounded. Being grounded didn't stop her. She put on a hoodie and hopped out her bedroom window. Paul, on the other hand, has his buds to hang out with. A girl he thinks is beautiful is on his radar. Eventually, he meets and dates this popular girl named Lannie. Her popularity and love for glamour has her planning every minute of their Prom date. She wants to go all out. It's all she talks about. He goes along with it until the morning of the Prom. He has a very familiar, yet horrible, feeling come over him. It's a panic attack. His mother calls Lannie and Paul knows she will be upset. The stress of the Prom has triggered his attack. Later that night and after sleeping all day he feels good enough to eat and then borrow the family truck. He is out for an adventure. Candace, is a loner and artist who lives with her grandma and a dad who's depressed and drinks. They are somewhat loving and caring but she needs to get out of the house. She is looking for a perfect spot to create some awesome graffiti. Roemi is gay. His date for the Prom is a no-call no-show. At Prom, he planned to make a big splash and win the crown. Still in his tux, not wanting to change, he heads out of the house but not to Prom. He couldn't face it alone. Later that night these four strangers randomly meet and form a sort of kinship through unusual circumstances. How will they pass the time on Prom night without getting caught? Author Tom Ryan has created a story that young readers will connect with. This fast paced read has humor, suspense and a familiar vibe of teen emotion. This tale does not really have a coming of age vibe, but is more about friendships. Readers, teachers and parents will enjoy this story alone or as a group read along."
4	"This book was very helpful in the sense that even when you think things are bleak financially, there's a way to turn your life around and live debt free. The author explains how to accomplish this systematically in baby steps. Besides the religious part at the end, it was a very informative and pragmatic book."
4	'a good little story. I enjoyed it but definitely felt that it could have been fleshed out more. It is a clean story.'
4	"I can't believe book two was not the end of the story. Although I enjoyed it as much as the first, I get rather frustrated that I need to continue getting additional books to find how the whole story finally ends. I really wish I could just read the whole story in one book."
3	"Would have given it a higher rating if it wasn't for the explicit sex scenes"
2	"The h is just stupid she's comparing her situation with young girl taken to be in a cult and abused.  She keeps telling herself to be strong, she has a friend out there who wants to save her, that he bhas no right to treat her that way. Really because she agreed to her situation, it's not even her situation it's her sisters at any point she could tell him who she is and walk away.  But no she's to lame to find the type of man she wants.  Its one thing to be submissive its another thing to be weak.  She's just as manipulative as her sister."
4	"What an ending! This story couldn't have ended any other way; it was just perfect.\n\nVintage 2 begins from the end of Vintage 1; right into the action. Nothing has been left out my the author with the reader left guessing what happens between the two books. I like that.\n\nRoxy and Parker could be anymore perfect for each other. After everything that they go through to get to where they are and then to go through more before they say 'I do'. They have a really strong bond and this is shown in everything that they are put through by the mystery threat that is hanging around their lives.\n\nOh and the secrets that are revealed. I didn't see some of them coming but did made the story so much better because of it. There were even a few sections were I started to tear up. The author really made me feel with this book.\n\nTeam James Forever!"
4	'I really enjoyed this book. It is well written and easy to read. There is some crudity that I am not used to seeing in this type of book and some interesting takes on moral issues.'
4	'What a nice surprise for a holiday that started out to be dull. They both had a wonderful Christmas when they thought it was going to be lonely.'
2	'If you already know their story, this book will only put all the already known facts under one cover.  I was expecting something new since it is a new book.'
4	"The Duke and The Baron: Absolute Surrender by Jenn LeBlanc was an interesting read.  Charles, Hugh and Amelia's story was a bit confusing at first.  Jenn LeBlanc has penned a story with plenty of drama and sizzle.  This is a complete book, not a cliff-hanger."
2	"And then I became annoyed and disappointed with the story.  The college background and the erotic-wannabe character just didn't work.  His sexual preference didn't add to the story.  Her willingness to go along with his preference was too simplistic.  The memories were confusing.  I often didn't know whether it was present day or not.  What the heck was the purpose of Nessa in this story?!  The number of sex scenes were ridiculous and unnecessary.  I'm all for hot steamy sex scenes, but this story was throwing them at me left and right.  If anything, I thought it took away from the core of the story.  I'm not giving the plot away.  But I think with some rewriting, this book could be a lot better.  Sorry to say, but I do not recommend this book."
4	"It's Dickens - if you are a fan you will enjoy. The challenge with Dickens in general is that he wrote in installments for magazines and was paid by the word so the installments (chapters) to be be encapsulated episodes and wordy."
2	"I was intrigued initially but was disappointed in the character development.  The love scenes were the same over and over. They kept referring to being knocked up.  Not a very accepting or loving term for the baby they both wanted in the end.\nThe second story made the girl seem a little slutty. Is that how women are perceived now. Loose easy lays? I would rather have a little more work in the relationship instead of one nought stands and easy lays.  Sorry that's just me."
4	"This is one of those books that is worth having even if you're not looking for Casein free recipes because while looking through the book, you're learning about Autism as well as collecting recipe ideas that can be modified to suit your needs!"
4	'Owning the Beast by Alexa Riley was sweet, sexy and especially dirty..in a good way of course ;)\n\nI love that Ms. Riley incorporated the "Beauty and the Beast" theme into this story. Annabella and Griffin were such an unlikely couple, but perfectly matched. Despite being a short story, the characters were well developed and I felt that the plot was as well.\n\nIf you\'re looking for a tastefully written and erotically charged story to pass the time, pick up Owning the Beast. Highly recommended!'
4	'I would recommend this book to anyone needing a light, enjoyable, fast read.  The couple have a friendly past, the girl is best friends with the guys sister.  Their attraction is like fireworks!'
1	'Total waste of time and money. I studied, using this guide, and failed the exam miserably. The information in this "guide" did not cover anything on the test. I would have been better off going into the exam cold. At least I would have saved myself the cost of the book and the time I wasted studying from it.\n\nIf you want to be prepared, this book is NOT the way to do it.'
4	'My only problem was the numbers I add in are so hard to read?? Wish there was a way to darken the numbers or put in another color, may be something you would work on.'
1	"Another romance/porn book listed as fantasy because ghosts are mentioned, there's a bit of mysticism and a touch of the supernatural."
4	'This story was not quite what I expected. I thought it would go one way, but then doubted my thinking. An interesting look at how a family can cope in the face of tragedy.'
4	'The book is a useful tool in helping and dealing with a depressed person. I have encountered a lot of depressed persons, few of them are close to me who would seek my presence and assistance. Now that I have read this book, I could understand and help them more. The book clearly discusses on the different ways of identifying signs and symptoms of depression and anxiety as well as on how to approach and deal with them accordingly. With this book, helping a depressed person could be much easier.'
1	"I found the short stories to be very boring. The other Bombay stories were funny except for these last two books. I personally didn't like them."
3	'Hmmm....it was okay but once the hero first spanks the heroine, that is pretty much all they do. It is like he needs to do this for foreplay because they almost always have sex right after. It is weird and I guess I did not read the synopsis well because I had no idea that was what was waiting for me in this story. It did have its moments where it was a descent read so I am giving it 3 stars!'
4	'My choice of rating is an 5....I feel that someone can relate to thAt story in more wAys then one. I love the book cause it kept my attention data hold time'
4	"It's a mediocre love story but the writing style of the author should be praised."
4	"Yes, I think our pets could be with us (not in heaven) but in the resurrected life here on earth. I'm afraid Christians have been too much influenced by Greek ideas."
4	"Good book. I don't think the title fit cause I don't feel like there was enough about Greek and Fiona."
4	"I got this for free. I have not read it when I do I will up date review! I recommend this can't beat the price!"
1	"Where do I start?  The series starts off and the idea for the storyline was good, but it just deteriorated into some big pile of crap.  The characters, instead of growing and becoming more complex, actually end up devolving especially with Gwen and Thor.  They both start making a lot of decisions that go against the framework of their character.  Some might say this is character development, but I just call it lazy writing and have seen it in quite a few books lately.  Authors try to make their books more interesting and end up destroying what they had already achieved.  The only character in this whole series (up to the fifth book.  Couldn't even continue the story was so screwed up.) was Andronicus.  He was the only that the author allowed to stay true to his character.\n\nAnother thing I have a problem with in this series is the improbable battles and the otherwise godly strength, stamina, or luck.  For example, Erec hitting and killing everything he sees, or every hit by someone sheers off a limb of hand or leg.  That would have to be some insane sharpness to every blade made.  Sounds fishy.  Also, what is with Alistair needing rescued?  She has magic, yet can't seem to escape from some slavers or save herself from being thrown out a window.  She evens says she fought with everything she had.  All that and yet she can scare off an army of monsters to save Erec.  Hmmmmm.  Looks as though the author couldn't think about that.\n\nDon't bother with the series."
4	'A fun little Lincoln rhyme mystery. Quick and easy read. Nothing new but generally entertaining. Would recommend if you are a fan of Lincoln rhyme.'
4	"I received this book as an ARC for an honest review. I truly enjoyed Rich and Sierra's story. I enjoyed the fact that they started out differently than most couples but endured all they went through together. Even when Rich was down he knew there was something special about Sierra when he saw her. LOVE ENDURES ALL!!!!"
4	'i enjoyed reading one story every night before bed.  marsha boulton has a way letting you feel that there are other ways to live in\nthis world beautifully.'
4	'Cute little paranormal love stories. Yes, there was a little sex, but this is definitely not an erotica book. I actually really enjoyed each of these short stories. Sweet, colorful and imaginative quick reads.'
1	"Horrible.  I spent only $2.99 for the Kindle version of this book, and I feel cheated.  The author (I use the term loosely) has no idea how to write a book.  The characters seem to be present merely to move the story line along.  The pacing is too fast from the very start--as if the author is DESPERATELY trying to snag the book store browsing potential customer into a purchase.  There is no introduction to the plot, you are just dropped right in.  Most of the action/events are straight out of your favorite B action movie.  Usually, a book will give you more information about character thoughts/emotions than a movie.  Even a screen play will.  Not true here.  I'd rather see the movie.  It's just awful.  Save yourself some time and money and look elsewhere."
4	"It is a collection of letters in chronological order, forming a kind of diary of the author's ET and mind-control/black-ops experiences as a victim/participant. (one may debate where consent begins, when the subject is rendered passive, mind-controlled, or technologically overwhelmed) The author writes from the POV of her mental self-defense delusion that allows her to survive psychologically: extreme coping mechanism.\n\nAs they say in Clinical Psych Class - amnesia is there for a reason as are self-delusions. The Self has to protect itself from things too horrible to endure without self-destruction otherwise. We must respect this and 'meet the person where they are' in order not to endanger their mental health further. When they are able (if ever) to process these traumatic events for what they are, then we will be there for them. Whether or not the events literally, physically occurred is irrelevant for this reason: the patient believes they are. We approach them knowing and accepting that this is the 'reality' they live in every day. It is their 'norm'.\n\nThe author is well-spoken, obviously educated. She is equally obviously a PTSD/repeat trauma survivor who has forced herself to believe a different reality (Draco reptilians and the MONARCH Program/CIA handlers being 'friends' she 'loves to interact with'.) where the perpetrators of abductions/attacks/experiments upon her throughout her life, are benevolent and/or no worse than Humans with cattle. In the next breath she sometimes admits they terrify her, and their violence/cruelty appall her.\n\nThis is valuable for psychology majors, UFO researchers, conspiracy followers, those investigating 'above top secret' government programs, and especially those who are interested in ET/Govt participation in abductions/hybridization/mind-control. From my limited understanding, this woman is affected by Green Star Programming as well as others, for which I refer the reader to Steward Swerdlow's book '13 Cubed', and William Schnoebelen's book 'Space Invaders'."
4	"Initially, I wasn't thrilled about the book, but I have a tendency to do that until I really get into the heart of the action.  Once I really jumped in with the characters, the book held my attention.  I would recommend this book to a friend."
4	"I love regency romances! I read the first book in this series and liked it, so I was looking forward to reading this book. And it didn't disappoint. The premise was quite common - governess and nobleman fall in love. The heroine, Miss Mary Woodward, was compelling - pretty and wise. The hero, Lord Eric Asten, was also compelling - handsome, aristocratic, and caring. They had good chemistry but not much sizzle. The storyline was predictable but entertaining. I like this author's writing style - plenty of action & dialogue. Overall, I enjoyed it, and I look forward to the next book in the series."
1	'Really disappointing book! It had so much promise that quickly faded when you introduced Julian! Just lost its appeal about 50% into the book.'
3	'I received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review as part of the Don\'t Buy My Love program...\n\n3.5 stars\n\nOn first glance,premise of this story sounds interesting enough - two cons after the same prize,Shelley fortune,pitted against each other,while in the same time developing romance between them. Unfortunately,execution was not that satisfying...or maybe I had high expectations. After all,I enjoyed every book I read so far by M.J. O\'Shea,and I expected nothing less from this one. But,you see that was exactly the problem.\n\n...anyway...\n\nRegarding the plot,there is not much I can say without spoilers,and besides,book is really not that long,so what you read in the blurb is what you going to get. Things got much more interesting when third player entered the story,and when Cory and Isaac found out the truth about each other and decided to work together. And there is...well,not so unexpected twist in the end,but it definitely spiced the book a little.\n\nAs for the characters...if you read books by M.J. O\'Shea in the past,you know to expect sweet,lovable characters,maybe little one-dimensional,but definitely not boring. And that works in NA novellas...it worked in Lucky Moon series which is all about second chances...but in a story involving one experienced con,and one not so experienced (but in no terms innocent) it didn\'t. It\'s hard to believe Icaac was taught by one of the best,when for the first half of the book he behaved like a sixteen year old schoolboy. I would like to say it was an act,but unfortunately it wasn\'t...I had a hard time connecting with him,especially in the beginning,but he improved by the end. Cory was definitely more developed character,with more depth,and I liked his POV better. Although I had some niggles with him,as well...honestly,I\'m a little sick of the "I don\'t feel,I don\'t fall in love" line,just to make one-eighty turn-around in matter of couple of days,after only couple of times sleeping together,and little talk in between. But that line is old as romance novels,so...I\'ll let it pass.\n\nAll in all,I\'m not regretting reading this book...despite all the issues aforementioned,I enjoyed reading it. Writing is as good as always by this author,characters are likable,sweet...So,as I said,I enjoyed reading it,just not as much as I expected.'
1	'Wanted ideas that also went with hamburgers'
3	'Just not very good. Wordy for no reason, and really left the litrpg roots behind. What parts remain are simply afterthoughts, just not very well done'
4	'I have missed feelings about this re-imagining of "Pride and Prejudice."  I love Curtis Sittenfeld and I like Jane Austen so I was very excited to read this book.  It took me a little while to settle in and immerse myself and then I enjoyed identifying characters and places from the original book.  But that also became a reason I disliked the book because especially towards the end, there is quite a departure from the plot of the original book and the situation the characters find themselves in seems quite out of place.  I hated the last 60 pages of the book....also, in this version I\'m not sure Liz was quite as likable as she should have been.  In the original I feel like she is a progressive, independent woman but in this book she is just anon. with not as many of the admirable qualities.  Overall, I enjoyed this book but I didn\'t love it.'
4	"This book is very good and it contains a lot of new and effective steps and information about Alpha Male. This book is perfect for those who are into this kind's of topic and for those who wants to know more information about this topic this book will be very handy for you guys. This book is very well written by the author and i highly recommend this book to all of you guys."
4	'Brennan who is scarred by wolf attack and mistreated by her step father is sold to two warriors. The witch told the warriors, Samuel and Daegon that Brenna would help save their humanity and prevent their beast from taking over them. There is a sadness to this story. I wonder whether Brenna will love the warriors when she discovers their beast.'
3	"Up and down this book is good if you just like sex and more sex because that is what Wyatt gives you...Really it was a lot of sex and a bit of emotion and a tiny bits and pieces of action so okay. I have ready all Blue's books except Ballers and I like her style but please everyone has an opinion and I will still buy her books, this one just more sex and a little family affiliation, I don't know when I try to relate the story it hit and missed."
4	'The subject is not new to me.  I just thought I would see if this offered anything new.  Very interesting.'
1	'One of the worst books I\'ve ever read.  The beginning was okay, and the focus on the two people who help the three women was interesting.  That would have made a better story.  "Bible John" was disgusting as were the descriptions of his diseases and murders.  I have NO idea what all of that had to do with an Oregon Trail story.  Not every journey was pleasant; this story had no historical significance at all.  If I can, it\'s getting deleted from my kindle.  GROSS.'
4	'This is the 1st I have read by B Alexander. I actually enjoyed it. I am looking forward to more. Strangers and sex. Well if you want it, go for it. Right? Thank you.'
3	"It was nice to read something a little bit different from the traditional romance novals or mistery books. There is something that I actually didn't like very much - the book is a little bit like Fifty Shades Of Grey, and when you have read it, all the rest reads similar."
1	'OK but not great'
4	'To me the story started out a little slow, but then it really kicked into action.  Nice blend of character development, and action.  I really enjoyed seeing how he developed - trying to keep his secrets, but still dealing with the people he was involved with.  I would highly recommend this book.'
4	'Great Book to partner & read with a beginning reader-It has simple words that are good for them to read but a lol long for most to read entirely alone.  Very cute'
3	"Not the best by Matt Shaw! A generic Texas Chainsaw was what I felt I was reading! Sorry Matt not one of your best. Not a long read and wasn't a wreck just not the best!"
3	'Cliched characters.'
2	"I really hate to say this but I am very disappointed with this book. She could've just ended the series with the last book and I would've been fine with that. I'm going to have to agree with another reviewer when they said it doesn't even seem like this was written by the same author. I love, love, loved the other books in this series and will definitely read them again. But this just didn't grab me in the same way. It was completely predictable and the lead characters just didn't have the same draw as the lead characters in the other books. I found the lead female to be especially annoying and very immature. I don't think I got through a quarter of the book and doubt I'll finish it. I might try, but right now I just can't do it."
3	'I like that the book outlined the process and it was very easy t read.  I just thought it was too short.'
4	"Love this book. Annora Soule is one of the few authors that writes a great BBW book. The story draws you in and makes you feel you are there.  As a BBW myself this means a lot to me being one myself.  Thank You Annora Soule. I can't wait to get in your Gator books"
4	'The best of a very good series. Nice coming of age over the course of the series, interesting magic, and a powerful dragon. And the growth of the gangling boy makes for some wonderful recognition scenes - "you\'re Prince Jorem?!"'

Her best friend contacts her and expresses her concern about her mate Geo. He is having a longer time of healing and she is concerned about the hospital where he stayed in Portland.  Something just dies not sit right.  Now her brother and his team is asking her to go undercover with them.\n\nThese two are hot and passionate.  Good short story, but kind of ran out of gas at the end.  I wanted more of an epilogue that would wrap it all up nicely and that did not happen."
3	"After having read the previous books in the series, I wanted to find out what happened to this couple. Sadly, I was rather disappointed in this story. There just didn't seem to be any anticipation or suspense. One might guess from the beginning that the courtship would be successful, but there wasn't much conflict to be resolved, nor did the characters seem to grown and learn from their experiences. At the end of the book, most of the characters were the same people they were at the beginning."
2	"It wasn't as good as Come to me"
4	"Great story with a paranormal twist, swoon worthy guys, and a sassy heroine.  I liked the author's writing style and pace."
1	'I gotta say, I really do not understand where the high rating for this has come from. This is one of the most poorly written indie books I have read. The depth of the writing is at about the same level as a children\'s book. The story was shallow and familiar, and the character development was essentially non-existent. The characters were all the same and there was no way to distinguish between them. I will say I was actually surprised that from a story so basic, the author actually found the ability and wherewithal to introduce a love-triangle. Love-triangles aren\'t for everyone, but I wasn\'t expecting something that required that much thought, as the second guy wasn\'t introduced until almost 40% into the book, and I had already grown accustomed to the book\'s predictability. Brennus was clearly supposed to be the bad boy of the two, but even then, there was really no character development, just a few "he said sarcastically", and a few "with a cocky grin". If you showed me a scene but took out all uses of the words sarcastic, arrogant, and cocky, I am sure I would not be able to tell if it was with Brennus or Kaleb.\n\nI really don\'t know why I struggled through this. I was probably hoping it would get better, or the story at least would prove interesting enough to make up for the writing. But in the end, I really didn\'t give a damn about any of them or their kingdoms. It had what others considered a sad ending, or somewhat of a cliffhanger, but I feel no inclination to read the sequel. I would give this 1.5/5, because there was one original idea in it that I have not seen before. The idea of the marks. Although, maybe its been done before and I just haven\'t seen it.'
4	'This was a very short novella. Chris and Sara are in Paris where Sara will learn more about Chris and his need for control. While I loved this short glimpse into Chris, I felt it was more about Amber and her need for Chris. Very well written and a great segue into the following book.'
3	'Took a while to get into, but it was worth the read. Strange world.'
4	"Sometimes your first love is the one you can't forget. That's what financial expert Myles finds when he discovers his childhood lover is now a successful artist. Myles is moved, not only by Davion's art but by the striking resemblence he bears to many of the models. When the old lovers finally meet again, sparks fly and neither is willing to walk away. Yet Myles' fear of coming out just may drive them apart once again.\n\nThe Untold Want is a lovely, well written romance. The two main characters are black and their speech and actions reflect not only the attitude but the culture as well. This plays into Myles' fear of coming out and his worry about disappointing his parents. These details are wonderful additions and add a nice fresh twist to a familiar story. Likewise the sex scenes between the two men are smoking hot and add some nice variety. There is nothing dull about this story and it keeps your interest from beginning to end.\n\nThe writing is very good and every character, even the secondary ones, is fleshed out and three-dimensional. From Myles' humorous assistant to the gallery owner, even Myles' parents and grandmother are interesting on their own and add a lot to the story. The length is perfect and leaves you satisfied without needing more. The only bump in the otherwise smooth pace is the ending feels rushed and too easy, however that's unlikely to bother most readers.\n\nThe Untold Want stands out from the sea of romances for the good writing and in depth characters. The story may be familiar in many ways but still feels fresh and different. The romance will satisfy fans while the erotica delivers on all levels. Despite a few quibbles, this is definitely a story I'd recommend.\n\nOriginally posted at Whipped Cream Reviews"
4	"Martins sister was dumped by her boyfriend and has nonrefundable reservations at a fancy spa resort. Martin comes with her for moral support and you know, spa!  The two of them are so cute together, arguing like loving siblings will.  What they agree on is the hunk wearing the speedo at the pool. Eye candy, yes sir!\nUnfortunately, the next time Martin meets Rod, the gorgeous swimmer, hes half drunk, has to pee and is locked out of the hotel room.  Naked.  Embarrassing!\nI admit it, made me laugh.  Hes a teacher for petes sake! We cant be locked out of our hotel rooms.  And not naked!  But meeting a hot man by the spa, toe jobs and general hotness?  Might make it worth it.\nJust an aside, I won't say who does it, but my absolute favorite part was a Valentine card delivered with a fully loaded breakfast tray this morning, starkers and with the card tucked between his buttocks.  Ive no idea how he managed to get up the stairs that way  That made me laugh out loud and even now, picturing it, makes me smile.\nShort, cute and fluffy Valentines story!"
4	"I almost gave up on this book, but I'm so glad I didn't! At first I didn't feel much of a connection to the characters and it seemed to be jumping around. I kept reading and was eventually hooked! Don't give up on this book!! It's worth the read. I can't wait to read the next two!"
4	'i feel for the poor girl, to be us trusting as she was and to sufer at the hands of her boyfriends father was awful. Well written'

4	'Read it as a gifl and loved it. Rereading it was fun. Would definitly consider it a classic, every home should have a copy.'
4	"It was very good.  I think I should have read them in a certain order and it appears this is a continuation from Cooper's Fall.  The characters are all part of the same area and coordinate with each other.\n\nI would read more of her books.  Liked them better than 50 shades!"
4	'I enjoyed the book.  It had a good story line and interesting characters.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes thrillers. I plan to read the second book in the series.'
1	'This is NOT a love story. Fifty Shades of Gray is about control, and contracts and abuse. Telling the story from his perspective doesn\'t change the fact that he is a 40-ish year old man preying on the naivety of a woman barely out of high school. He uses her for his own pleasure, not allowing her to get close to him because of "demons" in his past. The sex of this book is not the biggest problem for me, it is the dangerous aspect of the relationship, or lack thereof. There is no real love, and how can there be when you start a relationship on a contractual "I can do anything I want to you and you have to let me" basis? For years we have tried to teach our girls to be strong, to stay away from men who abuse them physically or mentally, to remind them that they are special and no one has a right to abuse them. We do not need a story like this to solidify the opposite of that, to tell girls it really is okay, especially if the man is handsome or rich. Let\'s stop putting ideas like this into girl\'s heads and stop calling this "romance". I know for a fact that young girls- 12-14- are reading this because the book store doesn\'t card for age with books. Please be aware of what your daughters are reading. E.L. James, please, no more of this.'
4	'This was a well-written little book, with the author doing an uncomfortably accurate portrayal of two people stumbling to make their marriage work. Marrying for several reasons, none of which is love, leads to emotional pain and misunderstanding, magnified by his job and her dying mother. Happily, Jessica and Daniel manage to eventually move from their rocky relationship to one of passion and love.'
4	'This is the type of novel that keeps you wanting more. Well written, easy to read and complete in few hours if you are like me!!!'
4	'This was a great read. A compelling, unusual storyline, with good, well written characters. The writing is very good quality, nothing overdone or cheesy. I will definitely follow the Brothers of Ink and Steel series.'
4	'Mended is the conclusion to the Broken Trilogy that began with Broken and Shattered. But fear not...there is a spinoff series if you want to read more about some main characters we have grown to love in this series...namely Mark and Keith.\n\nThe dedication pretty much sums up the book:  "Our journey in life will test us, mold us, and define us. Weve been broken and shattered, but now we are mended. Now is the time to live. Now is the time for happily ever after."\n\nThe series itself took us on a whirlwind ride of lies, deceit, pain, hope and love. Savi has felt all of these in so many different aspects of her journey in life. She\'s been kidnapped -- several times -- she has endured the pain of loss in so many different ways. Will she ever be able to find herself? Find who SHE is? Can she learn to live with the deceit and lies that are just now beginning to rear their ugly heads? And will she ever learn to trust? Trust completely in both others and in love?\n\nWe finally find out how Savi\'s story will end. It goes without saying that even this book is not a smooth ride but getting to the end and finding her peace makes the ride worth it.'

4	'Mr. Hallman has done a nice job.  Unlike other recent books I\'ve read it appears that his one may actually have been edited and spell/grammar checked.  I don\'t know if that is actually true but my grammar school teachers weren\'t crying in the background as I read.\nThe author doesn\'t fall in love with explaining his fictitious technologies and I do appreciate that.  I do think he makes a mistake with the native language as all the apostrophes make the reader slow down to decipher the words and I think the flow suffers a bit.\nAs I noted another critic say "I read a lot of science fiction so I read a lot of bad science fiction."  In this day and age this one should rate 5 stars compared to some of the crap I\'ve read lately.  Judged against 50 years of sci-fi reading it\'s a solid 4 star.  My knock mainly involves how a 40 year old survey ship\'s helmsman is inexplicably aware of the tactics and weapons from what is likely thousands of years before her time.'
4	'A reasonable attempt to cover a quite complex story,covering some of the political interference and personalities involved.'
3	"This book seemed like it had some many working parts but just didn't connect to me. I understand where the author was going I just didn't get there.  Emily going to such an extreme was one thing but then there was family drama, health issues, clubs and Doms, and a love story wrapped into it. Not a bad read though and I finished it in one sitting."
4	"Couldn't put it down until done"
4	"Bite Me is a fantastic start to the London Undead series!\n\nIt is a short book/novella and I was drawn into it from the start. It is fast paced, action packed and most importantly, believable.\n\nThere was a lot involved with this book but it never came across as too much, and it didn't feel rushed.\n\nSeth and Maisie are fantastic characters. Seth is a little brooding, considerate and comes across very sexy! Maisie is emotionally strong and strong willed, and she knows how to handle a gun!\n\nI really enjoyed reading this, but it ended way too soon! I can't wait to read the next instalment in the London Undead series and continue Seth and Maisie's journey."
4	"It's a short, quick, interesting read. It's amusing how similar the complaints are to those in modern politics. I think people would be surprised at how much they recognize and agree with in here, though their desired solutions obviously don't work."
2	'Not a big fan of Jordan Rubin.  His history is not a normal one for all.'
4	'This first book in the series was good.  There was an interesting mystery and a little romance.  The characters were likable and I am looking forward to reading more about them.  I hope the next book has a little more romantic tension to spice things up.'
4	'A useful guide to changing habits, and as a result changing bigger things.  Thus breaks it down and makes it simple.'
4	'This book kept me reading. I was curious to see how it all worked out. Some parts I thought could have been a little better, but in the end I was happy.'
4	'Good book great way to get away'
4	'The first book was interesting and entertaining as you travel back in time of the main character in the book. I never guessed why or how why reading the book. The second book continues in the story line and further explains how this can happen. Very creative and believable. I felt satisfied on how the author brought things to a conclusion.'
4	'I really like this series.  I have become a bit obsessed with MC books as of lately.  This is one of the better ones.  I love the way I can feel the love Tessie and Shooter have for each other.'
3	"This was an okay premise, and the story could have been better. I really didn't connect to the characters. The only real connection that was felt was between the siblings. I didn't see how the H/H grew to love each other when no real relationship was established."
4	"As someone relatively new to the short erotic fiction I sometimes find it overwhelming, frightening and sometimes a bit taboo. This really wasn't the case. The LGBT nature was in no way offensive and a relatively gentle introduction into the genre. The characters were surprisingly well developed for a short fiction and very easy to like.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed Adella's obtuseness to the situation surrounding her and her obvious ignorance as to Sally's feelings for her. It made for a very fun and cute read. Which in turn made it rather exciting when Adella started exploring her feelings toward Sally.\n\nBrilliant language use and imagery made it very easy to follow the setting of the story. It has been a while that I found myself being able to see the surroundings so easily and with so much clarity.\n\nNow, seeing as it is an erotic story, I should probably highlight some of the more exciting aspects of the book. The passionate scenes were rather fun and playful, well thought out and very entertaining. It was easy to read and left me feeling pleased and happy with my time spent.\n\nbook from author for the purpose of an honest review\nreviewed by angelique"
4	'It was a good read but very predictable.'
4	'This book held my interest throughout. The characters were well developed and I could perceive what they were thinking as well as what they were doing.  In addition to the plot, the reader is introduced to habits and traditions in Cuba.'

4	"Trudy is a biographical historian, however, she doesn't know much historically from the mid 1800's forward. When her ex is found murdered, Trudy is tasked with writing the biography of the Prince of England. While in London to meet with the Prince, she learns she is a suspect in her ex's murder. After returning to the states for questioning, she learns she has inherited everything from her ex. While researching the Prince, she visits the Cotswolds to see the home she inherited. When someone trys to burgle her new home and a good Samaritan ends up dead, she is more determined than ever to decipher the clues and figure out why she is being seemingly targeted in two countries. Fighting feelings for the Prince, trying to write the biography, stay alive and figure out what's going on, Trudy is looking more than sleep. A wonderful new cozy series I am looking forward to reading."

1	'Disappointed that it was only the persons story and not food menus or helping me create a meal plan.\nThe tips are things most already know - journal what you eat, how you feel, etc.\nI was hoping it was going to help me "create" a meal plan based off the things I enjoy and maybe even taking some regular recipes and making them lighter or something like that.  There are no recipes or any food lists.'
3	"Katie had received her regular maintenance spanking earlier before the party. She was supposed to be on her best behavior. Adam, her ex was a guest at the party and her spilled his wine on her grandmother's bared her bottom and spank it again like he'd done a few hours earlier. The spanking was followed by a BJ in front of every one there."
3	"The writing style is not very interesting, and the content is hardly a revelation to anyone who has ever read a web article about job searching..... best parts are the quotes included in each daily section, and some of the author's personal experiences are also kind of interesting.  I bought it free so I'm satisfied.  I don't plan to read any of the author's other job search books, as this one was not overly insightful.....but I might look into his poetry book, as it appears to focus more on his life experiences which seem more interesting."
4	'This book left me with several different feelings.  It started rather slow but I am extremely glad that I followed through and finished it to the end!  This was an amazing story following Alex Loevsky a Russian Jew and his trials and tribulations of finding a way to get out of the country that decided to turn its back on a whole religion.  I have never read a book set during the Cold War on the communist side of the Iron Curtain.  As I said this book was a sow starter for me but I am glad that I have the philosophy that if I start it I will finish it because for me the 10th chapter onward was some extremely riveting storytelling.'
4	"Space opera with poor science with compensation provided by interesting characters (who's motivations may develop as the series continues)."
3	'This is the first time I wrote a review with less than 5 stars. I pretty much love every book I read. Lol. But I have to say, I hated the character of Tate so much that it ruined the book for me\n***"spoilers***\nIt picks up 2 years after Jared had left. Now Jared goes back cause his mom is having a baby. Tate, who good forbid had to give her boyfriend some space for him to find what in his life he wanted to do. He had come back 6 months because he had said "I am not leaving you, I need to find what I want to do", but she being the childish person she is couldn\'t wait, and 6 months after he left cheated on him. Oh I know that it was supposedly supposed to be he left and she had to move on, but that is not how I saw it at all. When he left he said he wanted her but just wanted to be a better man for her. I felt she did not deserve him at all. So now he is back and she is a raging a hole. Everything is his fault, and she is in a new relationship but her thinking is " Jared is a dick because he sits next to another girl", she came of spoiled, childish, selfish, horrid. She betrayed him and through the whole book, you are supposed to believe that she was in the right or was justified in how she was feeling. I did not feel that. I was also not a fan of fallons during their book but I did like her finally in this book. Her and Madoc. Jared was also great in this book, and I kept hoping he would drop Tate and get a girl that wasn\'t an a hole and who didn\'t try to push all the blame to him when it all belongs to her but of course I know that wouldn\'t have happened so it is what it is. So for I think the first time ever I rated a book based on how much a character made me mad. Now this is just the way I felt, someone could feel completely different. And if you have read the previous books you might as well read this one, because you do get some other story\'s . and I finished the book for just that reason, cause i read all the others.'
4	'Pretty good and a fun read.  But, I found myself comparing this unfavorably to the Outlander series, as they are set in the same place, time period, and even share some of the historical characters.'
4	"As someone who teaches a course on the kinds of theories the author critiques in this book, I find this a very useful series of essays. It takes a lot of time to run down the factual distortions, omissions, conflations, and outright fabrications that usually characterizes these theories, so Colavito has done a service to the field in taking the time to do it. I have used his information before in my class (properly attributed!) and will certainly do so again. The book is well written and an engaging read, with the touches of humor that also characterize his blog. The only reason I took a star off the rating is that there are way too many typos and errors in the text (I have the Kindle version). I don't know if these are the result of the transition to digital text or just a lack of close editing, but they are a distraction from an otherwise excellent text."
4	'By\nC. J. Glassberg\nI enjoyed reading the book. I especially liked the illustrations. A well written book for kids.\nI recommend this book.'
2	'The story started off interesting and very believable.  The farther along you got, the story line got more and more unbelievable.  A lot of the last half of the book could have been left out and the story would have been better for it.  The ending, however, was good and befitting the character, Jimmie Barnes.'
4	"Great idea since I can't get out as much as I used to. Now if I can just get it to work..."
3	"I received a free copy from the author through Book Funnel.\n\nThis was a very sweet romance set in a college in Toronto. One young man struggles with his love for his best friend and his course work. The other tries to prove he loves girls.\n\nThis was just too short. The author posed questions, in my mind, that weren't answered; who is Owen talking about, what happens with Liam's grades, will he change his course of study?\n\nMaybe some of those will be answered in the second book in the series but I don't know!"
2	"Couldn't tell if this book was any good or not because it wasn't readable. Don't know if that is an issue with Amazon or the author. Kept skipping sections and at one point repeated over and over the same sequence. Hopefully it can be fixed"
4	'<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Becoming-Mrs-Kumar/dp/B00CBD4CH6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Becoming Mrs Kumar</a>\n\nHeather Gupta\'s "Becoming Mrs. Kumar" and her protagonist Julia Robinson are both refreshingly honest. Reader instantly relates to Julia because of her vulnerability and sense of adventure. You don\'t have to be an expat living in India or a woman eager to find her true love to feel for her.\n\nJulia, like the book, doesn\'t pretend to view India as a \'spiritual salvation\' or \' third world country full of smiling poor people a westerner is supposed to learn from\'. She is bored of her safe existence in London and wants some adventure in her life. She also wants to find a man!!! The book narrates , quite humorously, her experience in the mad metropolis in Mumbai as she falls in love, makes friends, works hard and parties harder.\n\n Julia is spunky and doesn\'t shy away from brutal introspection now and then. As she accepts the difference of culture, she gradually becomes part of the city she is living in. Its is quite interesting to read about an outsider\'s opinion on all things big and small in Mumbai, and how it shapes her character. Gupta is entertaining with her dialogues, characterisation and slice of life narration. The book is an easy read with minor exceptions of a few choppy dialogues and repetitions.\n\nThere has been a long tradition of Indian Diaspora writing. Gupta is an expat working and living in Mumbai for the last ten years. And it is obvious from her book that she has that special \' love-hate\' relationship with the chaotic life in the maximum city . This is how a true Mumbaikar would relate to her city and that is an achievement for Gupta. She refuses to fall in the trap of sentimentality or contempt.  Instead she has tried to write a startlingly honest story about a modern woman who wants to live a full life.'
4	"My only regret is that it was too short. I'm looking forward to the followup. I will be looking at more books from this author."
4	"History professor Hillary Bennett has lost her career and husband due to an incident that she didn't cause, however, she thinks that her life has hit bottom. Desperate to get at least her career back on track she travels to Scotland, where an old lady has promised her to let her research diaries referring to the execution of a woman that was accused of being a witch. But when Hillary arrives at Glendon House she finds the old lady dead in her house. Now what?!\n\nThings seem to get a good deal worse for Hillary since Caid Douglas, the moody black sheep of the Douglas' family inherits the house and everything in it.  Unfortunately also the diaries of the witch's execution. He doesn't want the house, she wants something that's in the house. After a rough start to their relationship Hillary and Caid find a mutually benefitting arrangement to peacefully co-exist. But not for long since the more they feel attracted to each other the weirder things happen around them.\n\nAn interesting and well-crafted plot that kept me focused and entertained. The story line was well balanced between romance and suspense and the author managed to create a vivid atmosphere of the old manor and its surroundings.\n\nHillary and Caid were absolutely great together. Both were troubled souls who were given a second chance in life. They were both depicted very realistically and I absolutely enjoyed their banters and little fights.\n\nWell done!"

4	'Our first Ben Bridges book this story was very compelling. The story is kind of short, only about eight chapters which leaves you wanting more.'
4	"After reading the author's Hot Damned series, I thought I'd give this a try.  Whereas the Hot Damned books could be considered novel-length, this is a novella which feels like the set-up for the series.  We apparently meet all of the series' main players and there is definitely enough quirks in each of their personalities to want to discover the secrets that have yet to be revealed.  I especially want to learn more about Essie's best friend, a male, gay vampyre, as well as her grandmother.\n\nEssie, a highly trained agent with the WTF (Werewolf Treaty Federation) is sent against her will back to Hung Island in GA, the very place she'd run away from a year ago, after women she knows from the Pack go missing from there.  And of course the guy she'd run away from is the Pack's Alpha and the town's sheriff.\n\nLight, funny romance, without the humor being quite as over-the-top-outrageous I've come to expect from the author's other books.  It's definitely more PG as far as the language, but we are provided with explicit sex and quite a bit of sexual tension.  And we're left with more than one mission to be worked on in the next book.\n\nI expect I'll be reading the next book."
3	'Who does your editing. This one was OK. Not as exciting as some have been. Plot is good characters strange. I like that in a book.'
4	'writing was choppy and sometimes not put together in a correct sentences, but it did catch your attention/'

4	"Aqua Alaskan Nights is the first book I have read in the series and the first book by Amanda S. Jones.  It did not dissapoint and  I found it was an entertaining read.  If you are looking for a new author to read or if you love reading series then I think I have a perfect match for you.  Having never been on a cruise ship before it was fun to escape for a bit with Hayley and experience Alaska through the authors descriptive words!  One thing I most definitely did learn about myself is that I am soooo thankful I have never had a boss like Hayley's."
4	'Well written, fast paced, and a great read for anyone who enjoys thrillers that contain a little of the unexplainable.'
4	'i really enjoyed "Haven", written well in true-to-Falter style. Harrison and Kennedy continue their search for a cure while fighting the infected. Its a good continuation, though the fighting scenes get a little redundant. There is an unexpected twist that keeps the plot moving. The last few chapters do keep you on the edge of your seat and though it\'s a little hokey, it ends well.\nLooking forward to reading more of Falter\'s nivels.'
1	"This book was so awful. The story definitely could've been better and it was really disappointing. I got about 95 percent done and didn't even want to see how it ended. The heroine made me cringe, and not want to be female. Really pathetic woman and situation."
3	'It was an average book, but at least in my case it did not provided new information or anything that made a difference for me.'
4	'Well written and believable.  A stark reminder of a brutal war that is little discussed and the citizen-soldiers who fought it.'
4	'Although the time is familiar it is totaly different than the other book I read which was by another Author.  I enjoy how he began the story and its a page turner. I also noticed that Twins were totally different in personalities even though they were identitical. I will read other books from this author but he has to make our main characters a little more stronger.  I give it a 4 based on some of the errors but outside of that he is a page turner.'
4	'Her plant suggestions are good. The advice is good for clay soils but not for clay soils in desert climates.'
4	"Just the kind of book than warms the heart.  The characters Michael and Melanie were opposites who weirdly worked, fitting together like a glove.  Michaels mother being the evil cow in the family, was what didn't quite work in my opinion, that and her incredible bossiness when dealing with her beloved sons.  I will be interested to see how the series plays out finding a love interest for each of the boys, I do hope there will be a Gay romance mixed in, reading how mummy will react will be hilarious.  I just think having such an amazing family and being so close she would love and accept who her sons choose as long as they were happy, but I suppose we needed a bit of angst.  I thought it a shame the rape was not explored more as it could have really provided an extra star in my review ;).  Good all round book."
2	"I always love reading stories of people training for marathons or ultras, to feel the pain they go through. This however was just dull. It is just his running log. He is clearly a gifted runner since he didn't seem to feel much stress training through a winter in Maine. Everything appeared to come easily to him.\nI judge books on whether I am glad I spent the time reading them, or wish I had read something else rather than wasting the time on a book. THis for me was a waste of time."

4	"Excellent beginning. Interesting story. Well written. Scary ending. I just want more. That's a good thing.  I will definitely read other books by this author."
4	'An exciting read.  My only complaint is that the ending was very abrupt.'
4	'Decent story, needed better proof reading, but not so bad as to ruin the story.  A little simplistic but a good story.'
4	'A really good read, not at all reflected by its rank of 1,927,662 in the Kindle Library.  But its no Children of the Corn by Stephen King either.  I like the part how genetic mutated genes in the corn go into all the foods we eat, and passed on to unborn infants, a little scary, but it explains poor little Madelines extra fingers and web toes.  As for the ability of the author to explain life cycle of corn, I liked it.  I thought that some of the metaphysical imagery was really particularly effective.  Interesting rhythmic devices too, which seemed to counterpoint the surrealism of the underlying metaphor of the story.  I would have given the book a fifth star if the author had included her poem about their stream rushing over the rocks getting off onto the yard.  Was hoping get my  book signing and to meet the author, but how do you sign a downloaded file??'

3	"3 out of 5 stars, this is a novel about a man/owl shifter finding his mate and trying to prove to her that she is exactly the one he wants. It's a spicy and suspenseful novel that keeps you on your toes! I liked Lana & Dover together, their chemistry sparked off the page. Plus, I enjoyed finding out the dynamics going on in Lana's nest and in Banff.\n\nThe only thing I wished I liked more about this novel was how the plot played out, since it wasn't as straightforward as I would have liked. Not that I would have wanted to know how this novel was going to end right away, I just wish I could have liked what was going on around Banff and Lana's nest more so then what happened.\n\nOverall, though, I recommended this novel to anyone who likes reading shifter romances, especially ones with unique breeds.\n\nReview By: From Me to You ...

4	'I recently downloaded the e-book Mental Strength and Positive Attitude: Seven Core Lessons For Achieving Peak Performance in Life by Jason Scotts Life. Overall I would say this e-book is very informative and an easy read. Jason Scotts provides the reader with practical guidance and knowledge in an effort to educate you on the effects of positive thinking and embracing yourself. I particularly enjoyed the topics/ lessons covered in Chapter three "Mental Strength - Benefits Of Positive Affirmation" and Chapter six "Mental Strength - Importance Of Exercise" as both of these topics are areas in which I personally need to develop.\n\nChapter Overview:\nChapter 1 - What Does It Mean To Have Mental Strength\nChapter 2 - Mental Strength - How To Be More Positive\nChapter 3 - Mental Strength - Benefits Of Positive Affirmation\nChapter 4 - Mental Strength - Learning To Develop Ones Talents\nChapter 5 - Mental Strength - Importance Of Meditation and Prayer\nChapter 6 - Mental Strength - Importance Of Exercise\nChapter 7 - Mental Strength - Developing Independent Thought\nChapter 8 - Mental Strength - Dealing With Risks\n\nDisclaimer: I received Mental Strength and Positive Attitude: Seven Core Lessons For Achieving Peak Performance in Life by Jason Scotts at a discounted rate in order to read it and provide some honest feedback about the information contained within.

4	"Darksider is the third book in Erin Kellison's reveler series. This could possibly be read as a stand alone but would be much more enjoyable as part of the series since a lot of the world building is done in the first book and several of the characters are from previous books.\n\nThe Reveler world is a mysterious and interesting world and very different from your typical paranormal romance worlds.  Erin takes you to a whole new place and it's very entertaining to read about.  This book centers around Harlen who works as one of the Chimera who police the dreamworld and Sera a chief whom he had a previous relationship with when he was younger.  Sera is being stalked in her dreams and she reaches out to Harlen for help.  They reconnect as Harlen puts everything on the line to help Sera and she is drawn into a larger problem Harlen is facing with the corruption of the organization he works for.\n\nThe fact that Harlen and Sera had a previous relationship helped this book since it was not very long and so it was easier to believe the rekindling of a past love then two strangers falling for each other instantly.  I really enjoyed Harlen and Sera as a couple and how they worked through past misunderstandings and also to see how Harlen had grown and changed for the better since his previous relationship with Sera.  It was also enjoyable to see them interact with the previous couples from the previous books.\n\nThis book continues on from the previous books and doesn't have a conclusion for the overall arc of the series.  It was another wonderful addition to the series and great for someone looking for something different to read.\n\nCopy gifted in exchange for an honest review"
4	'SOMEONE LIKE YOU is probably my favourite (so far, one more to go!) of the Oxford series. It wasn\'t perfect (I\'m so over these "breaking up because [reasons]" excuses and unfortunately Layne has something of a standard formula for them..) but it was emotional, strong, heartfelt, heartbreaking, funny, sexy.. all with the classic Layne spin on the elements.. and full of all the familiar faces of our beloved couples (seriously, it\'s a lot now).\n\nLincoln\'s story has been a long time coming and it was definitely worth the wait. I kinda cringed over some of the earlier reveals because it felt too similar to Riley\'s plot twist in the Sex, Love & Stiletto series but it became so different over the course of the book that I didn\'t see any similarities after a while. Though I will say how hilarious it is that both these characters, with their respective jobs and personalities, were so much more than what they showed to the rest of the world. But in Lincoln\'s case, unlike Riley\'s, his reasoning was so so tragic.\n\nDaisy, too, had a story worth rooting for. We saw a little bit of her in Emma and Cassidy\'s story back in the original series and I liked her growth, her comeback, and how Layne made it a thing without making it a thing. I know that might not make sense but trust me, it does.\n\nWhat surprised me about this match-up was the strong friendship these two characters had. The common ground they found with their secrets, their demons, and how that evolved so naturally. Not at the same time, of course, because what fun would that be. Angst was needed. But I still enjoyed it so very much.. until I didn\'t totally. Sigh. I mean, it wasn\'t dragged out, but I would seriously love to see a different progression of events in book four. Maybe it makes for a less "exciting" read but damn, I\'m just so over the break-up portion of the romancelandia relationship evolution.. especially when everyone, even the characters, either see it coming or predict it themselves. I\'m so over it.\n\nIf you\'re on the fence about starting this spinoff series, I would say you could skip the first two and dive right into this one, especially if you\'re as desperate for Lincoln\'s story as the rest of us have been ever since he was introduced. Because, complaint aside, it\'s definitely worth the read and I\'m very much looking forward to a good hate-to-love for the final chapter of this journey.'

4	"Book Excursion Book Reviews\n\n4.5 Stars!!!\n\nI was given this book to read in turn for an honest review!!!\n\nDevil and Molly have returned! Are they still the hot, sexy, strong couple they were at the end of Sizzle, or has marriage, family life, and planning their best friends wedding taken a toll on their passionate love life?\n\nScorched is one hilarious rollercoaster ride of comical, unexpected moments! I was crying in laughter on more than one occasion. Devils mental state and patience is truly tested in this sequel; the friends they call family have no clue of the suffering and misery hes feeling, how desperate he is to simply have the intimate moments he and Molly both need. Here we see the extremes Devil is willing to go to for his friends happiness and to keep his marriage sizzling HOT! Scorched is a reminder to all couples no matter what it takes or how long it takes, make sure you make time for each other as a couple.\n\nIf you have read Sizzle you won't want to miss out on this sequel. If you love contemporary erotica romances full of humour, you will absolutely love Sizzle and Scorched by Sarah ORourke."

I'm glad I did; I enjoyed this the first time I read His to Protect, but enjoyed it just as much the second time!\n\nTrina just left- literally ran away from- her abusive husband, who is a well-connected and high power figure with a lot of resources. Declan is trying to keep his restaurant/bar from going under after his wife left him a few months earlier. He finds Trina going through his dumpster to find food for her dog. Instantly, Declan feels the need to protect her, while not fully knowing what Trina's story is.\n\nI enjoyed His to Protect. At times, it felt a like it was moving a little slow, but I loved Declan and Trina, as well as all of the side characters! I recommend this book!"

3	'As it says in my header this is a good book but at times is rather unfocused. Sometimes it seemed like it was supposed to be a spiritual book and at other times it seemed like it was supposed to be more sensual based. As the book moves on it gains focus but can be tough when you first start reading it. For the $.99 it cost I would have to say it was worth it'
4	"I've loved reading all the Bellingwood books. I gave this one four stars because I did not enjoy the Lydia/Aaron story so much in this book. It was a little too confusing. Keep 'em coming, Diane; we never tire of Polly's adventures. I don't need to write more because I agree completely with all the other stellar reviews!"
4	'Phoenix Sullivan did a good job with the characters and original idea. This is your usual tale about a biological bug run wild but with fresh ideas and science. The science is well defined but without too much detail to drag you down. I love the incorporation of extinct and prehistoric animals being brought back for hunting. His style reminds me of one of my other favorite new authors who wrote the techno-thriller titled Three of a Kind&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Three-of-a-Kind/dp/146092553X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Three of a Kind</a>. Another great read. Check it out.\n\nI gave the book 4 **** stars even though I would have liked deeper character development, but overall it passed my biggest test. It kept my attention and kept me reading when I should have put the book down and went to sleep or did some work. Thanks Sullivan.'
4	"Great set of books on staying healthy and working on your diet for the new year! It's interesting how to author talks about how sugar is an addiction and goes into specifically how to get over it. Some of the things are very simple and just require a little self discipline. Would recommend for some simple tips on living healthier."
4	'As much as I liked this book, it was a bit confusing! Aside from the fact that there were points where you had to guess who was talking or what was happening because it felt like the story was a bit rushed, the names and all of the characters were so confusing. You almost needed a character list so you could remember who was who. The main character Arisianna who went by Aria, has two sisters Ash /Ashiara and Aster, her  "crush\'s" mum was Allaysia, her daughter Ayla, and even though the story was told from Aria\'s perspective she called her parents  and her grandparent by their first names, and later you figured out to whom she was referring. Also for a girl who was home schooled and loved being just with her parents in a jungle in Brasil, she was quite removed from them when they arrived. I also found the knowledge they all shared about the new power born into their family which was obviously Aria yet never discussed a bit odd?! And finally I hate that it just finishes, Its miserable when authors write books that are only finished when you get the next book!'
4	'Good story, light reading.'
4	'This book was kind of slow in the beginning. Picked up a lot. I thought the main female character was flaky and immature. She is after all only 18. She sees and older guy and starts fantasizing about him and they have a relationship but he says he will come back and never does. This book leaves on a cliffhanger. I would buy the next book but if came in box set I would buy that more. Worth the read.'
4	'Very informative, lots of good information from a different perspective'
3	'This was a short and sweet story.  Georgie is cute and funny, as usual.  She also expresses trepidation at being a young and inexperienced lady at events with older and more sophisticated people.  The story isn\'t historically accurate, though, as it is a fictionalized account of how the Prince of Wales met Wallis Simpson. According to Wikipedia, "On 10 January 1931, Lady Furness introduced Wallis to the Prince at Burrough Court, near Melton Mowbray".  This book takes places in October 1929. So I had to take points off for this historical inaccuracy.'
4	'It was a real short story, about love gone wrong in High School. What goes around comes around. High school sweethearts, bad break up, then finding each other again and living happily ever after.'
2	"When I started the book I liked it but the ending was a let down. To avoid posting spoilers I won't post much details but in short the behavior of people after the crisis happens near the book end is very unconvincing. People usually do not act that cheerfully in such circumstances. Also the last chapter consists mostly of big info dump without any action what breaks the pacing of the book. It should be at least partially moved into the next book in the series. As it is now it really weakens the ending. It feels like the writer was in rush to finish the book so he didn't spend much time working on the ending.\n\nOverall plot is not very original. It is yet another young hero type of book but still it could be enjoyable if not for the weak ending."
4	'Easy read. So good ideas and suggestions'
4	"I just love this series and I am looking forward to the next few books!  The first is still my favorite but, Leanne Davis doesn't ever disappoint.  I was hesitate to read the story of Gretchen and Tony because I wasn't sure if I cared about these characters from the other books, but, I was wrong.  Definitely worth reading."
4	'Into crystal and their power.  How they can heal and where to place them for the best usage.  Also a little on yoga'
4	'I just read my copy you sent via email. Thoroughly enjoyed the story but it left me saddened when she died in the end. However the sexual content was awesome and the passion was hot.'
4	'Short and sweet and to the point.  Very cute love story between Max and Sofia.  I wanted to read more about what the future would hold for the couple.  But overall, good book.'
4	'This book was more on the thriller side than I usually read.  But it was a good story and actually made me gasp at a plot twist.  A good read.'
3	'Except for the horrible, or missing editing.....to ME, a total joy-killer.....Complimenting instead  of complementing, the use of I instead of me, etc etc......'
3	"This is a book written with the concept that parents will purchase and read to their children and that will be used to build confidence and self-esteem.\n\nThe backdrop for this is a young rabbit's grandmother's home that young Hopper is moving to, but is apprehensive.\n\nNearly every page has a nice, sweet, color illustration. Further, every critter, including the fox, is equally sweet, kind and friendly, making Hopper a welcome member of their community.\n\nI applaud the attempt, and the sentiment. I am sure many children will love the story the first time they hear it and will be encouraged to learn how to read.\n\nTheir older siblings, though, are likely to deride the story, for their is far too little drama. This, I think, is an important point insofar as developing interest and in provoking discussion.\n\nIt isn't a bad story, but it does lack drama and fails to provide the essential setting to provoke excitement and emotion.\n\nHad the fox been, say, an outcast from his own family BECAUSE he was too sweet and, hence, an embarrassment to his society, this could have built some interest AND provoked a discussion. Also, it would, or could, help toddlers come to see that they live in an imperfect world instead of heaven or paradise --- perhaps I'm being a bit to cerebral, but that's just me.\n\nThis 34 page illustrated Children's book shows the author to have potential as a storyteller and I sincerely hope she continues.\n\nThree stars out of five."
4	"I got this as a free book download. Free downloads are a mixed bag. Sometimes it's ten pages of disbelief followed by laughter, others it's a badly written book that's somehow compelling anyway. But sometimes it's discovery of a wonderful author who writes about characters I'd like to know. These books are well written. I read to alleviate stress. There has been a trend toward anti-heroes and death around every corner, in every car trunk, under every rose bush, or in every dumpster. I like those books, but it can get tiresome. Always some violent ending of life. Or lots of lives. This kind of book is a lovely change of pace from that.\n\nI have liked or loved every one of these books, and may eventually write reviews for them all. In any case, these are fast, fun reads with great characters and light and easy plotlines with happy endings. I know other reviewers have criticized that, but not me. I'm okay with spending time with some fun characters, doing silly things, and helping each other cope with imperfect lives.\nAnd yes, I happily paid for the rest of the books. :-)"
4	"The Arc was given to me by the author for my honest review.\n\nI really enjoyed this book. Not many books attract my attention like this one. It was hard for me to put down, and that says a lot due to my attention span.\n\nI loved Aurora's (Rory) character. She takes on a lot of responsibility for a 17 year old by taking care of her younger brother, because their mom is almost non-existent. They have settled in this trailer park and Rory is the new kid at school. She try's to keep a low profile. While she was walking down the hall at school when Tobias (Toby) runs into her and knocks her down. While helping her pick her stuff up when he sees her big green eyes and falls for her.\n\nToby is from the other side of the tracks. Will a relationship work between the two of them. He has his group of friends, his parents all in his ear telling him he deserves better. Will they get a chance to see if there is something there?\n\nRory's best friend is Amandolette (Mando) I loved this character. She is a wonderful friend, she has a great attitude, she's always sticking up for her friend. She loves fashion and always has to be different from the (plastics).\n\nDue to unforeseen circumstances, Rory meets Rome. Rome is there for Rory, they become best friends. He's an awesome character, he looks after Rory and protects her.\n\nThis book shows the strength of a young girl trying to make it in this world. This book shows strength and courage. A definite must read.\n\nI give this book 4 stars because it was a fast read. It kept my attention and I didn't want to put the book down."
4	'O.M.G. This novella is amazing! I love the look into who Zorin is: his past and what the fight means to him. This is a great addition to the series and worth the read. Definitely recommend! Keep in mind, this is Zorins POV so there will be references to House of Ravens.'
4	'Deadly Delicious by K.L. Kincy is a delightful mix of fun, action, and magic. The intended audience is upper middle grade but anyone can fall in love with the characters and setting of Deadly Delicious.\n\nAge Level: 9  12 | Grade Level: 3  6\n\nSetting: 1950s Paris, Missouri with a side trip to the swamps of Louisiana\n\nMain Character: Josephine is twelve years old and feels she is a disappointment to her lineage. All the women in Josephines family have amazing culinary skills with a little something extra added in. Josephine deals with self doubt,  friendship issues, a budding romance, and coming into her on; all while trying to control cake eating zombies and battling the big daddy voodoo spirit of the Ravenous One.\n\nThree words that come to mind for Deadly Delicious: Light-hearted Fun Fantasy\n\nI loved the setting. You get a peak into the 1950s with its carhops, onion rings, poodle skirts, and Rock Around the Clock.  I also enjoyed the light hearted way that the cake eating zombies are dealt with and the introduction to the good and bad side of the Ravenous One. I think the way the author showed the extremes of Papa Nom, the spirit of hunger was brilliant.  It was great seeing Josephine come into her own and accept the support and help from her friends, mother, grandmother, and ancestors. Within the pages of Deadly Delicious are several lessons worth remembering. I hope you get a chance to discover them for yourself.'
4	"See subject line.....wait....let me cut and paste.....\n\ngreat....a few chapters were superfluous ....but other that that I laughed out Loud many many times....that's always fun."
3	"Can I be honest here?\nI am glad I read The Protector and Barretti series' before reading this. It was alright on a whole but if you wanna get into the nitty gritty of it.. I couldn't stand Dane.\n\nHe was a miserable, self centered ass, who need a good punch. All about me, me, me, and kept pushing Jax away and then he did leave, he was questioning why. Moron.\n\nI loved Jax and how protective he was over Dane and the bubba, the relationship between him and Emma was beautiful to watch and grow.\n\nI am interested in Gray's character when he was on the scene so will continue on in the series."
3	"I am almost finished with the third book in this boxed set and keep hoping that Maddie will develop as a character.  I don't think it is going to happen.  To be fair, the author's breezy writing style is humorous and entertaining.  Unfortunately, her protagonist is the most shallow character I have come across in a long time.  There is not much to like about this selfish, shallow woman.  She hasn't met a promise she won't break. She is Lucy Richardo without the warmth and charm.  If she is not doing something that makes you cringe in discomfort, she is doing something that makes you want to scream at her for her stupidity.  All that is important to Maddie is food, shoes, and sex.  And we're supposed to believe that two handsome, intelligent men are totally smittened with this almost thirty year-old who apparently has never read a book and acts like a 16 year-old boy when it comes to eating, sex and personal hygiene.  I guess that's why it is called fiction.\n\nIf you like light, humorous mysteries with a mindless protagonist and a bit of soft porn thrown in for good measure, you may like this series.  If you want a heroine that you can relate to or is at least believable, stay far away from Maddie."
3	'This story was a little to much like a love child between "The Wedding Date" movie and "The Proposal" movie. It wasn\'t bad, but it wasn\'t original enough for my taste.'
1	'I got this book because I enjoy theology and philosophy and I am always seeking to learn. I should not have wasted my time on this book. It is basically an outline of fundamentalist Christian doctrine with a few names changed and a rather bizarre "debunking" of evolution. I did not feel I learned much of value, except perhaps that pushy intolerant religions are all the same. As Christians and Muslims are both sons of Abraham, I expected quite a bit of similarity. However, the "my way or the highway" attitude that makes Christianity so endearing is just as overwhelming in Islam.\nI have met many Muslims over the years and most of them were pretty rational "live and let live" kind of people. I think many might be embarrassed about this interpretation of their faith. All I really learned from this book is that Islam apparently considers a complete break from reality to be just as necessary as does Christianity. The whole "It must be true because the (insert name of holy book here) says it is, and I know the (insert name of holy book) is true because the (insert name of holy book) says it is," attitude is pretty lame in both faiths. I have met good Muslims out there, but this book would make you think that they were rare, which is certainly not the case.\nIf you like tautologies and irrational arguments, this is the book for you. If not, give it a pass or you will be getting a more negative opinion of Muslims that many do not deserve.'
4	'Really liked this book a lot and will read the the next book. I liked the storyline and looking forward to see where it goes from there.'
4	'It was a good book. I liked the concept of it and I was ways wanted to keep reading. I enjoyed the romance and the ending felt right. I really liked that the main character was deaf and that she also had a ton of character development.'
2	'Full of errors e.g. revolvers do not have magazines,the taliban were not fighting in the Gulf Wars, and what are "F18 Super Eagles"\nThe author needs to research more.'
4	'I\'m enjoying this series and plan to continue with the next.  That said, I felt that the 2nd story, "Lancejack," was the best so far. "Eden" was good, but it seemed to move slower for awhile with more introspection by our main character, though it\'s easy to see why from all he\'s been through.  There were also a lot of missing/misused words in my Kindle version that should have been caught by a good editor.\n\nOn the plus side, Richards is able to portray the confusion and horror of war much better than most. I also really liked the character of Yulia and hope to see more of her in the next installment, and I\'m also hoping to see ole Woody finally gets what\'s coming to him!\n\nI like the continuing saga of Andy and like I said, I do plan to purchase the next in the series because I\'m too caught up in the characters to quit now. Well played, Mr. Richards, well played.'
4	"I screamed when the story ended or of the blue... it's ok I got the sequel than goodness... I would definitely recommend it's a great story"
4	"This is very interesting. i don't see what it has to do with anything because it has not shown up on my kindle at all. but i like most of these ads and everything"
4	'I would highly recommend this as a YA book for my wife to acquire for her school libraries. . . were it better-edited. There were far too many misused words such as the adverb "anymore" misused when what was intended was "any more," and many, many instances of compound words separated into two words and two words used when a compound word was called for, along with other words misused, the occasional apostrophe abuse or neglect and far, far too many comma splices. I cannot recommend she acquire this to corrupt students\' English literacy in such ways.\n\nOTOH, I sincerely wish it had been better-edited, because the story is engaging, the characters are appealing, and the theme has useful lessons to impart--without any heavy-handed didacticism.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed the book, apart from all the times the (lack of proper)  editing threw me out of the story, hence only one star knocked off.\n\nI will, however, purchase and read the next book, in hopes that it will have been edited well. Let hope be not dismayed. . .'
4	"This book is incredibly hot and it is a hit for this author. I am already a fan of this author so when I saw the new book I had to get it. Let me tell you it did not disappoint. My only problem was trying to stay away from it while trying to get other things done. The relationship between McQuade and Rose is not an easy one. McQuade is use to being his own man and is not and does not want a mate. Rose on the other hand has been put down for so long she doesn't know what to do when something or someone good is staring her in the face. This book is a great give and take, push and pull between two stubborn characters that you will be rooting for till the very last word. I would highly recommend this book"
1	"This book is a hodgepodge.  The author throws in everything but the kitchen sink resulting in a very choppy and incomprehensible story.  When I got to the last 200 pages I was so angry I just wanted to get it over with.  By then I had read the first two books and I wasn't going to give up.  I can assure you that it was not worth it.  The author obviously hopes to be the next Michael Crighton.  Although the entire series is very visual it would make a crap movie as the story goes nowhere.  To add insult to injury the last book had all of the edits left in which was very distracting and irritating (I wish I could get my money back, so don't waste yours)."
4	'Not my usual type of mystery.  I prefer a good who done it.  On the other hand it is action packed, violent to the end which I actually thought was pretty good.'
1	"My Kindle is only letting me show 1 star, but I am actually giving 5 stars to this fabulous story.  This is the 3rd Anna Denning mystery, and we learn more about her, as well as getting involved in another edge-of-your-seat thriller.  Along the way, we're treated to another trip through small-town Colorado and its surrounding countryside, with the sights, sounds, and the smells of a Colorado autumn.  I hope Me Kaufman is feverishly working on Book 4, because I can hardly wait!"
2	"The book 3 was alright but ma's that CHAS and OMERE ended on a cliff hanger way. They should have gotten back together but hey maybe there is a 4 coming soon"
4	"One of my favorite periods. Good story, terrific escapism. Couldn't put it down once I started it. Suspense, murder, romance, fast cars and money. What more can you ask for?"
4	"This book provides a good, simple introduction to the DASH Diet.  Theres an overview of the benefits/philosophy of the diet, as well as foods to avoid and those to embrace.  The recipes are simple and easy to follow.  Some of my favorites include the Zucchini Parmesan Chips, Creamy Sundried Tomato and Garlic Sauce and the section on desserts.  Im partial to sweets, so the dessert section was especially appealing.  The recipes include calorie and sodium counts.  Although the book doesnt include suggested daily meal plans, they're easy enough to pull together from the recipe lists."
4	'I really liked the book and all the extras shorts added.  I\nplan to read the rest of the series.'
4	'A true classic which I first discovered in middle school and have read multiple times since then. This edition is easy to read and clear.'
1	"This book was almost painful to read.  There were run on sentences galore and I'm guessing the author must be a teenager.  If I didn't have an obsessive compulsive disorder that won't allow me to leave a book unfinished I would have deleted it.  Suitable read for a twelve year old mentality.  I honestly don't understand the good reviews."
3	"A K/U book.\n\n*************SPOILER ALERT***************\nThis book was just okay for me. The writing style was good\nbut, I couldn't connect with any of the characters. I didn't find\nanyone in this book likeable, well that's not exactly true, Ben\nwas the only likeable character in the entire book.\n\nThis a woman that suspects a friend of having or trying to have\nan affair with her husband. Not only is this woman her friend, but\nshe also provides child care for the couples daughter. The wife\nallows this woman to treat her like dirt because she is jealous of\nwhat the wife and husband has. She speaks to the wife in any manor\nand the wife says nothing. The wife in this story knows that this woman\nwants her husband, but doesn't fire her or talk to her about it or the\ntreatment that she is unfairly receiving.\n\nNot only does this woman treat the wife unfairly, but so does all of the\nwife's other friends. Everyone of her friends are jealous of her and talks\nto her and treats her like she is a nobody.\n\nI couldn't understand the wife's actions. She needed to grow a spine and\nstop being a punching back for her so called friends."
4	'my son loves it for trips outside the us'
2	"This story raises a bunch of questions without bothering to answer them.  It's designed to get you to buy the longer length work, but I wasn't interested enough in the story or characters to want to learn more.\n\nThere has got to be a better way to drum up interest for a novel - if your story isn't capable of standing alone, the item description should make that clear."
4	'I thoroughly enjoyed the book. I had previously read Pride and Prejudice and continued to compare them. I enjoyed the main characters and all the twists and turns of the nice and the sordid affairs.'
4	'Good Material for the busy preacher...'
4	'I\'ve read this book at least 10 times.  With it\'s slightly morbid theme, dark secrets, and romantic twist, this is a great book to read if you just want to "get away from it all."  Sometimes books come along and  change your view of life - if you\'re up for a change, try The Pool of St.  Branok.'
3	'I recieved this as a ARC for my honest review.  This is a very different shifter story.  I loved the chemistry between Liz and Eric, and I felt sorry for Nate.  I was rooting for him.  I wished that the story of the Lake was explained better.  I loved how Liz was strong willed and not helpless.  This book is a good read it just needed more explanation about the island and the shifters that lived there.  I would love to a follow-up on this story.  It is a good read I just wanted more.'
2	'This book did not live up to my expectations of an Irish gem. In fact, just a few days after finishing it, I find it hard to recall details.\n\nThe writing was gorgeous and brilliant. But unfortunately, the plot and characters were very dark, so I felt dragged down and depressed while reading this book. I got confused when the plot jumped all over the place, from past to present. The characters all resent each other bitterly, revealing little affection or hopefulness. Reading this during winter in Seattle was just too dreary.'
3	'Opinionated in places.'
2	"Never finished reading this book.  Didn't care much for the writing style or the stories.  Too bad because I really thought I had a winner on my hands.  I ended up giving it away."
3	'Elf quest continues its saga.  Story of the wolf riders and palace of the high ones, mixed in with Cutters children Suntop and Ember.'
4	'I love Tiffany Aleman. I want to read everything she writes. The abuse was handled very well in the smooth scenes and descriptive passages and makes this book so very enjoyable.\nWithout spoiling the book for you its hard to write much. The storytelling is fantastic. I felt like every word fit together so that you could see what was happening. I was on the anxious the whole time wondering what was coming next.\nI was gifted this book in exchange for an honest review.'
4	'Mick Blackwell is Hollywood\'s hottest star. He has carried a whole action movie franchise on his shoulders as the lead character, John Dark. But now he\'s in a new movie, a book to movie adaptation, written by author Piper James. In this one, he\'s supposed to be in love but being not only Hollywood\'s biggest star but also its biggest playboy, he has no experiences to draw on. Piper gets brought in to help him capture the feelings in her book.\n\nPiper James knows how Hollywood works. She even dated a hot shot actor before. But that blew up in her face so now she\'s treading carefully. Except Mick Blackwell\'s now in the picture and he is totally not one to tread carefully on anything.\n\nYou guys, this story was amazing! Why was it so amazing? Well, Mick Blackwell may have something to do with that... He is swoony perfection. It\'s no wonder he\'s a famous star with plenty of women fawning after him. He loves it. He likes the no-expectations-and-no-relationships thing he\'s got going on. Typical, right? Except he\'s SO much more. He doesn\'t necessarily want to be a brainless action star forever. It\'s what\'s gotten him so far, but he wants to be more. That\'s another thing I loved. He legitimately loves his job. It\'s not just being famous or the big bucks, he wants to be known for more. Which is what brought him to the movie based on Piper\'s book.\n\nThe minute he meets Piper, sparks fly. I know that\'s cliche and all for me to say, but that\'s how it felt. Robin infuses so much emotion in her writing that each scene played out beautifully, and that first meeting? Yeah, sparks, for sure -- the sexual tension was at an all time high! Piper has gotten terribly hurt in the past (by none other than another Hollywood actor) so she decides to go with the sparks and launch into a sex-but-that\'s-all type thing with him. I liked Piper a lot because she\'s so impulsive but also reasonable at the same time. She\'s got her head on right and is a career minded woman. She sets all the rules for Mick with their "agreement". She\'s witty and hilarious.\n\nOf course, this agreement turns into something more and they find themselves settling into a friendship. We find out Mick is really inherently a good person. There\'s one scene in particular I just literally went "aww oh my goodness". Sure he can be egotistical and all but he can also be fierce and protective and will stand up for Piper -- looking sexy the entire time, of course.\n\nBesides their romance, the plot is solid, and the secondary characters very distinctive and I loved them. (In particular, Mick\'s roommate Lincoln, would totally be someone I\'d want to read more about!) Robin definitely has a talent for weaving storylines filled with emotion, tension, and also humor. I was SO invested in these characters that I had to read in one sitting. Gosh, I loved Mick.\n\nIf you\'re looking for a good romance, READ this!\n\n*an eARC was provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest reivew. This did not sway my opinion or the opinions expressed in my review in any way.'
4	"Creatures of Fire is a fasted-paced, action packed romance. Sariel thought that she was just a normal human, but she learns that she is a half-demon, a fire demon to be more specific. She meets Alexander, another fire demon, and everything starts to change. Alexander is hell-bent on revenge against Sariel's Uncle. Sariel finds that Alexander has justification in his need for revenge. Soon they are on the run from her Uncle. On their journey they grow closer, even thought Alexander does not know what love is. With no other choice she is introduced to Alexander's world, Dschinnanya. Both she and Alexander must fight for their lives in the arena according to tradition.  Will they win? Will Alexander admit his feelings for Sariel? Is there a future for them?\n\nJ.B. Brooklin has created a complex world full of dynamic characters that are constantly challenged and thrown into situations that test their metal and their resolve.  The realism weaved through the Dschinnanya world is incredible. The reader feels like they are standing with the characters in the overwhelming heat. This story has danger, fighting, romance, and near-death experiences. This story will make you hold your breath, yell in frustration, and wipe your brow with exertion. Join Sariel and Alexander as they fight their way toward salvation.\n\nI was given this book in exchange for my honest review."
4	"I am so thoroughly enjoying reading the Brazen Brides series. I can't wait to read the next book in the series."
3	"I know it's a short story, but the relationship between the two main characters builds really fast. There isn't much of a back story, and that was just a little disappointing..."
1	"It's not a problem or a plot if you have a problem and your hero comes through the door, end of story.  A two year old wrote this."
4	'I live this everyday. The thoughts and images that Willow thinks and sees I did that and still do. I work on myself mentally and emotionally daily but it can be a struggle. I love how she was able to learn to love herself inside and out and we are able to follow her in her journey.\n\nKane loving her and giving her the time to learn to love herself is a "grand gesture" to me. I love the story from the first word of the prologue to the last word of the epilogue.'
4	"This isn't normally my type of book as I have been reading a lot of lesfic, but I wanted to see what all the fuss was about in terms of the m/m wolf-shifting genre. I saw this title available for free and figured that it was no big loss if it turned out to be a bad read.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised because this book was really well written and had a plot that really kept my interest.\n\nMy one minor gripe with it was that when Corey finally accepted his mate, there wasn't as much turmoil before they had to consummate their relationship in front of the beta. Sure, there was some of that before but just not as much as I would've expected.\n\nOverall though, this was a fairly fun read."
4	'Good story of the hippie days.'
4	"Waiting For You by Catherine Miller was a highly-emotional, moving novel, full of longing, hope and surprises waiting just around the corner. The topics raised within this book are ones that I have no personal experience of, yet Catherine Miller's emotive language allowed me to feel everything right beside Fliss. The yearning for another child, to provide her daughter Hollie with a sibling to share her childhood with, was weaved right the way through this novel, pulling the characters forward and onwards. From just the first few couple of pages, I was hooked and emotionally involved within the plot unfolding and I knew that I wanted to join Fliss during this part of her life.\n\nWhat I really loved about Waiting For You was how many themes the author brings up within Fliss's story. There's the dissection of she and Ben's marriage, the focus on her daughter Hollie, the suspicions she begins to harbour, and secrets. This isn't just a straight road from beginning to end. It's intricate, displaying how one thing toppling over can eventually lead to the toppling over of other things in life, and Fliss has to deal with all of these and more throughout the novel. I really admired this woman, for how much she handled despite the internal war she was battling. Fliss was a strong, loving woman, despite the moments of sadness and weakness that the reader is witness to, and I wanted nothing more than for the author to hand Fliss what she wanted more than anything else in the world on a plate and be done with it. There's so much suffering to contend with, but I do know that, if the author had done this, I wouldn't have been able to dig deeper into Fliss's character and discover what she really was all about. She had hopes and dreams of her own, fears too, and when things began to take a surprising turn later on in the novel, I seriously hoped that Fliss would pull through.\n\nThe use of online forums and chat rooms to help Fliss through her trying times led her to make friends who were in the same or a similar position to her, which I felt this character definitely needed. It was sad because, despite Ben needing to have been there for her, he began to become more and more distant and so she turned to others for support. Thank God for friends, right? Here, Fliss found comfort that Ben (the idiot) couldn't provide. In fact, there were times throughout this book I could have happily wiped him from the novel completely because he wound me up so much, although again, his character needed to be included to add the conflict and confusion. These friends that Fliss made through the web were wonderfully special, the type of friends everyone needs around them when times are particularly hard and I was happy that Fliss had them there to boost her spirits and keep her going, because clearly Ben couldn't have cared less.\n\nThe pacing of this novel was spot-on for me, and when the television crew arrive after Fliss decides to document her emotional and physical journey, it speeds up even more. When faced with this proposition, Fliss really isn't sure that it's for her, but with Ben away so much and working late etc. she decides to go for it anyway, which nicely brings new character and friend Leon into the plot. I thoroughly enjoyed watching the relationships and friendships within this book change and take shape. They provided new outlets for Fliss and I think Leon came along at just the right time.\n\nUltimately, this was moving and tender novel about one woman's wish to complete her family. The characters were fantastic and led me down plenty of different roads, the themes explored opened my mind to numerous ideas and possibilities, and I think the author handled each topic with delicacy and the up-most care and respect. Her heroine Fliss was wonderfully created and I really wanted nothing but the best for her. Kind-hearted and warm-spirited, her journey was one full of ups and downs, and I finished this novel with a glorious happy sigh because it's just one of those books that, while digging deep into emotions, it still leaves you full of hope, love and with an eagerness for life.\n\nBecca's Books is awarding Waiting For You by Catherine Miller with four of my bookish stars. The author knows exactly how to tug at your heartstrings at all of the right moments, and I can't wait to read more from Catherine Miller. I hope Fliss is incredibly happy, and that sounds so odd, seeing as she's a fictional character, but oh well. Just one of those bookworm habits, I guess.\n\nSpecial thanks to Carina UK and Catherine Miller for providing me with a review copy of Waiting For You in exchange for a fair and honest review."

1	'Waste of time. It was not written by Kurt Saxon.'
2	"I felt like I was reading the same story in the last book.  I really hop Jade Kkye really introduces different characters - Cindy and Matteus are getting a little tired - always the same problems.  Not sure I'll read anymore"
1	"Not what I expected. Obvious left wing political agenda. Instead of explaining how to work social security based on your age, work history, marital status and health status, the author says SS is a handout established in the 1930's and don't expect it to be around when the gen-Xers retire. That's just one example."
4	'very good products and literature as well as convenient ordering processes.......will need to get a delivery system  to avoid delivery charges'
4	'This book helped a lot, but I needed, and still need a lot more help in using the Kindle Fire.  I realize the potential of the Kindle Fire and hope that I can harness it.'
4	'Adding a growl into the romance surely gets mix going. A dash of humor adds just enough spice to take it even higher.'
4	"I waited for the third book in the Find Me Series, and was not disappointed.  Kept me engaged and I read it in two nights.  You really care about the characters she develops.  I didn't give it five stars because we have a cliff hanger  and now we wait for number four!  Drat!"
4	'Loved the trilogy, and the origins collection. This was a great 4th edition to the series. Gave a little more insight to things you felt were missing from the stories.'
4	'I liked the way the two crimes eventually tied in together. The setting being in England or there about made it sometimes difficult to understand the words/language used. Overall a very enjoyable read.'
4	"An enjoyable read a few gramatical/spelling errors, but didn't\nslow down the read. Mr. Partlow is doing a great job and I\nwould recommend this to other Science Fiction Readers"
1	"I was very excited about this new series after reading the reviews here (for the print edition in 2000). It turned out though that I had misinterpreted what people were saying about a more peaceful society run by women. I had assumed that the time travelers were going to go back in time to begin such a society. It turns out that they were going back in time to save this natural order of things from the evil male dominated society of the horse people. By saving the peaceful society from the one invasion which brought evil into the world, there would never be any warfare, and all the problems of the present day, 6,000 years later, would be instantly erased.\nAlthough there are many things that bother me about this, the most obvious is that Europe was invaded by Nomadic Barbarians from the Steppe many many times. It makes me wonder if the author has ever heard of the Mongols, the Huns, or the Doric invasion. Even if you assume that the first invasion of peaceful farmers by ravaging nomadic horsemen occurred around 4,000 BC, stopping that one invasion wouldn't stop the future invasions.\nThe next problem is the author's premise that evil barbarity must come off the steppe, simply because our best guess at archeology and anthropology is that it happened that way in our past. In my opinion, even if you brought a nuclear arsenal back in time and created a radioactive dead zone from the Black Sea to the Baltic, so that Europe could never be invaded from the steppe, the peaceful farmers would eventually develop more complex societies that would come into conflict with each other and develop warfare on their own.\nWhat made Old Europeans peaceful in 4,000 BC was the low population density relative to the abundance of natural resources. If you increase the population density so that one group of people is crowded against another, the feeling of cooperation with your neighbor is likely to shift to competitive resentment. This leads in a natural progression to an us vs. them mentality, and open fighting. I don't believe that Europe's long history of killing neighbors to take their land derives from the Nomadic invasions of horse people.\nAlthough I think these starting premises preclude any possibility of a thoughtful and provoking story, the author didn't even make a good attempt. In the very first chapter, the woman, who is supposed to be in command but never really overcomes her own doubts and indecision, runs away in the face of the enemy, leaving her partner for dead. Now I was in the Navy not the Marines or Army, but I would think someone on patrol, particularly a West Point Cadet, would come and check the pulse before running away and leaving their squadmate. Maybe this is more realistic under the circumstances, but it certainly isn't heroic, something I look for in characters I read about. When the battle is over, and they're both alive, they don't feel any remorse for the string of mistakes which got the best 20% of their fighting force killed (the Great Dane). They make no effort at a Lessons Learned so they can do better next time. Instead they feel guilt and trauma about killing the bad guys in self-defense. It somehow makes them feel better to destroy the valuable hand made stone knives they took from the enemy dead, rather than keeping them for use by the peaceful farmers they are trying to save. It goes down hill from there.\nBasically, this is a story about people I don't respect, on a pointless mission, in a poorly thought out and implausible world. I would give it zero or negative stars if I could."
1	"Apparently an attempt at some sort of reprint of someone else's work.\nNot sure where this information came from, it has information on the Garand rifle, so isn't from a Public Domain book from the early 1900s.\nThe few diagrams are poor copy/pastes, apparently from the original book, no attempt to clean them up.\nFocused on military weapons.\nText is mainly instructions for operating each weapon."
4	"It's amazing that there are so many things I didn't know,that I didn't know about until I was told I didn't know about stuff I didn't think about not knowing. I bet there are people who now know that I didn't and still don't know. Yes I loved the book and recommend it."
4	"Enjoyable and entertaining...A few errors in spelling and misused words,,We we'll, instead of We will, but nothing was so bad that I couldn't understand what he was trying to say.  There's a very graphic sexual encounter, but he's single and over 21:-)  I have the other four books, and have started the second,it's just as fun as this one was."
2	'I have read a couple of books on Kindle and I believe this is the one that needed editing for spelling and grammar.  The story had the same "basic theme" as Gone With The Wind or at least I thought so.'
4	'I enjoyed all three stories. You should definitely read them. Hope you enjoy them as much as I did.'
1	"Only was given a preview.  Disappointed they didn't have the entire novel for free or a nominal fee"
4	'Great tips!'
4	"I'm not typically a fantasy fan - I'm drawn more to hard Sci-Fi but I have to admit this book captured me.\n\nIt moves from a quiet opening into definite strangeness.  But it is more than strangeness for its own sake.  Behind the kalidascope of reality shifts that ensue are intimations of greater worlds and organization, of notions that the world we experience, what ever it might be, is of our own making, and of good and evil forces that manifest as a result of our own intents and fears.\n\nFantasy fans should love this.  And this short volume is, apparently, the beginning of a series.  In spite of my bent towards harder Sci-Fi, I know I'll be interested to see the next book in this series."
3	'I liked the idea but it was hard to get into. There were some odd things like a girl having a baby at 8 that were hard to get around. I was given a free copy of the book to voluntarily reviewing'
4	'This was a book club selection for me and I LOVED the book..... it was racy, funny, and held a good mystery.  The only complaint I have is that now I have to wait for the sequel to see where everything goes :(.  I cant wait!'
3	'There was a while where I wondering if the plot was going to develop. But this was definitely a steal. Skyla left a bad situation and was determined not to become bitter when looking for the next person to have a real relationship with.\njohnathan was not without his faults yet he was the best thing that could come into her life. Skyla was not expecting to find love in the workplace.\nDuring their budding relationship there are plenty of ups and downs. I am definitely having to play catchup with reading the second book'
3	'I enjoyed this book very much. It was a quick and easy read. It was romantic, witty and the author keep the momentum going all the time. Good and consice plot, a page turner..'
2	'This was first read of Sicily Yoder, and I was a bit disappointed. Although the text was entertaining and light hearted, I feel it came to an abrupt end. The story started to jump around and was hard to follow after she accepted the dinner invitation....leaving things unanswered. The main female character was a bit flirtatious and outspoken for an Amish lady....Will I read her work again, not sure....'
4	"This is a fast paced short story that definitely keeps you engaged yet ends leaving you wondering if the author will finish. I want to know what is to become of Elena and Jackson yet I didn't see anything showing a book two."
4	"It started a little shaky. Oh no, another wanna be urban writer. You worked it out. Didn't realize this was all to God's glory. Kudos"
4	'This was a good book with a good story line. I really enjoyed reading it.'
2	'I read her book, "love child" several years ago and really liked it. My expectations and anticipations  we were too high.'
4	"It was a pretty good book. Now it's time for post two. What happen with Erika and Nathan after it got published. Did they continue with there sick affair. Did they ever contacted Jas after she left????? Please do a part 2!!!!!"
3	'This short is a decent time pass.  The writing isn\'t bad, but the storytelling needs work.\n\nJuliet is hungry and tries to steal some food from a group of men.  While running away after nearly being caught she runs into Wolf, leader of the men she was running from.  From there we go to ooh ah and aren\'t we just perfect together.  She is untrusting and lies.  He is frustrated with her doubts about him.  However, all of that floats away when they are indulging in passion.\n\nI found the writing style for the most part to be pleasant, however, for a book of this time period having the cli+++++ word thrown in was jarring and not very time appropriate.\n\nAs for the storytelling I had no problem with her sleeping with him the first night they meet, she was hungry, he had food, he was handsome why not.  I could even stretch it to him wanting her to hang around and dilly dally some more, what I had issue with was that they both seemed to want a fairytale ending so quickly.\n\nThe other element I had problems with was coincidence....as this is a short story I won\'t go into detail, but there are too many of them for my liking.\n\nNormally when I read a short I want one big emotion at the end.  Even with a light romantic erotica story I want to feel.  This unfortunately just passed the time and left me saying to myself "that ended abruptly".  Perhaps if I had read the other two previous stories I might not have felt lost in the universe, but as a stand alone story this did not give me enough insight into the characters of the H/h to make me root for them to end up together.  I actually kept thinking it would have read better as a one night stand.\n\nOnce again it\'s not a bad time pass, but it\'s not a great time pass either.'
2	'The 2/1 star rating isn\'t for the story. I wanted to read this because I had already seen the anime. The anime is great and fun to watch. So of course i\'d want to read the manga to see if it\'s any different than the anime. There are some differences, but I\'m not displeased with the story. I\'m severely displeased that Digital Manga Inc. has the balls to put out such a terrible scan of a manga that they have the rights to publish and translate. And charge 10 bucks for it at that! There are pages that have speech bubbles that cannot be read; the format that the pages are presented is... what were they thinking!\nHow to explain it. Imagine buying a digital book, and instead of getting images to sift through page by page, you are given a power point presentation that requires you to double click on 1 of 2-4 pages of said manga to read mentioned page. To go to the next page you need to exit out of the current page by clicking on the "X" that will cover the speech bubbles directly behind it. Zooming in is not really recommended for the smaller speech bubbles because the images provided in this power point presentation are so poorly delivered that just about anything not legible from your standard screen is just about guaranteed to be a completely garbled mess. To anyone interested in this at this point of review, do not buy. The publisher needs to do some quality control, because this is absolute garbage compared to the work that Viz or any other digital comics publisher delivers. We should be getting high quality to raw images of the manga that they translate and deliver, not the super compressed images that look to fit on something no bigger than a 2x2inch card. I\'m serious, stay away from this and just watch the anime. In the US, Funimation has it available for streaming. It\'s fun to watch, not safe for kids to watch due to the nudity. But if Crunchyroll still has their subtitled license, then teens can enjoy this show. Either ways please don\'t buy this, I like what I\'ve read, but in no way can I recommend this download to anyone until Digital Manga Inc. fixes their poor quality.'
4	'First book,started a little slow but by the second one I was hooked'
3	'A good story told well, but spelling and grammatical errors detract from the story. Since this is the fifth revision to correct those errors, the author may be better served by hiring a copy editor and saving money somewhere else. A good first effort that could have been better.'
4	"Im struggling with the appropriate star rating for this book, which Im finding Im doing more and more these days. This is one of those books that swayed from 3 to 5 often. Its why Ive chosen the middle of the two. Never once did I feel this dropped to 2 stars, however. It stayed well above that, for me anyways.\n\nFirst, the reasons why it dipped to 3, which youll notice is due to personal taste:\n\nOne, Im not a fan of description. A lot of detail, paragraphs of world history, and lack of dialog usually loses my interest. There is a fair amount of description in this book and even more history. It made me trudge through certain spots.\n\nSecond, it took me quite a long time to read this book when the length should have allowed me to pound this away in the span of a day of reading. What slowed it down was getting acquainted with all the names and places. It had a lot going on so this won't be a quick read. Even with as slow as I read it, Im sure I lost details.\n\nNow, why it rose to 5:\n\nI LOVE animals. This had transfiguration magic and a couple hounds as pets. I found the transfiguration fascinating and extremely well described. Furthermore, the hounds were a satisfying addition for an animal lover such as myself.\n\nI was immensely entertained by Whites subtle humor when the those rare moments presented themselves. It got a couple smiles out of me.\n\nIm not latched on to any one character, but I think Thaddeus is the most well developed of them all. Im not a 100% sure why I say so, save that I felt I got him as a character. Even so, I was always watching him with a wary eye. Honestly, over half the characters kept me on the fence, which is great. Theyre not your cookie-cutter types. Horst was my second favorite, though he seemed a little stiff sometimes. I would have liked more insight/emotion into his mind/feelings, more so for his past, how it shaped him, and how he feels about it.\n\nLastly, Im a fan of Whites writing. There were a handful of moments he lost me, but the rest of the time I fell into a wonderful, rhythmic reading trance.\n\nOn to the story itself.\n\nThis read more like a murder mystery to me. Since we stayed within the same city, there were no epic magical lands that we traveled to and we did not undertake quests that usually reside in fantasy novels. This isn't a bad or good thing. Its just something I felt.\n\nThat being said, there was magic, which I thoroughly enjoyed, and a few fights that kept me entertained (wish there were more). With Whites descriptions, I had no problem imagining the city and its denizens.\n\nWhat impressed me the most were all the tiny world details White crammed into the book. Indeed, this world is intricate, well planned, and White seemed to think of everything one would need to know to live in a real world.\n\nI have to say, Sir Edrics Temple is my favorite of Whites books, and I might have been begging the pages for more of his humor. White has the ability to create a serious, dark story sprinkled with jewels of hilarity. I savored those rare moments in this book.\n\nTo conclude my ramblings, Im very much looking forward to reading anything by White. With promises for a second book to Bane of Souls, I hope I don't wait too long."
4	'Of course when I saw the title, I knew it had to be the infamous Murder Mommas however, it was not but good. I wonder if there will be another book.... I want to know what happens to Brown.... I want to see what happens to Z also....'
4	'A very heartfelt and emotional story about being in a relationship and the next step and how it affects couples. Also about growing up but still retaining your identity. Loved how Kate did what she needed to do for herself and Carson and their relationship no matter how much it hurt'
4	'This is a well written and complicated tale with lots of characters and possible connections between the characters.  They keep arriving at a country home and being enlisted as actors in a performance of Midsummer Nights Dream.  Like the play, there are all kinds of misunderstandings and false behaviors, etc.  Also like the play, there is humor, sometimes in unintended ways.  Meanwhile, the H&h spend most of their time struggling with their feelings for each other in the midst of all the activity and their special obligations to the actress/director of the play.  It all turns out well and the ending is long enough for things to be thoroughly sorted.  However, for me, the play took over too much of the story and distracted from the romance.'
3	'It is realized that there are those who also call themselves Christians in the same manner, who adhere to fundamentalist doctrines and interpretations, just as there are similar fundamentalists in all world religions who do the same. Indeed, it could accurately be said that the Scribes and Pharisees were fundamentalist Jews. (I myself come from your midst-a fundamentalist Christian from the age of 12.)\n\nIn fact, fundamentalist brothers, my search for the truth first led through fundamentalist Christianity and there I stayed for many years. I used to argue much the same as you have here. I come to you now much as Paul appealed to his fellow persecutors of the faith after his confrontation on the road to Damascus. I still have not read this book, but I have now started it.\nWhat you need to know is that I had already realized that Jesus is an enlightened One, before I knew this book existed.  Yes he is deity. But so are you. In your spirit lies the One True Mind, which Jesus awakened, as did others, like Buddha 500 years before him. They are equal, and if you read the gospels you will see the same basic message from Jesus as Buddha gave, though even then it was not understood by most if not all. Brothers, this is what Jesus meant when he said, "Those who overcome will sit with me on my throne, as I overcame and sat down with the Father on His throne."  "Sitting with" denotes equality and unity.  Jesus\' message was not nearly as detailed, but Buddha had 49 years to expound it, Jesus only had 3. I know this sounds like craziness to you, just as what Jesus taught sounded like craziness to the religious in-crowd of the day. But it doesn\'t make it any less true.  "Overcoming" means to overcome the human mind\'s false views, passions and attachments, and transforming the ego mind into the True Mind of God.\n\nYou have argued that the rational mind is king in knowing truth. But as David spoke even 500 years before Buddha, "Thou dost desire truth in my innermost being, and in the hidden part, Thou wilt make me to know wisdom." The hidden part is the Spirit within you. Truth is not something you can get verification of externally, which is why all the religious who have not yet overcome will argue endlessly with other religions and indeed among themselves.  The "knowledge" of which you speak is basically the same knowledge "gained" in the garden that was forbidden. This is your rational mind, with all its trappings; the false ego that proposes we are separate from each other. Many have correctly quoted Jesus "I and the father are One." But He also prayed in the garden that we all would be One. This goes back to one of the most basic of truths, that there is only ONE Source of all. The One is many and the many are One. In the garden, we forgot this, we partook of the "knowledge of good and evil," which symbolizes the temporary dualities of the physical realm, we ran away suddenly naked and ashamed. This is because we perceived a separation that never really was. And we still live in this illusion today.\n Search the scriptures, no where will you find an exhortation to know truth by the rational mind and logic. The essence of the Bible tells you the same thing I am telling you, friends.\n\nWhat your mainstream Christian teachings have robbed you of, and indeed, as many misunderstood in the years following Jesus\' death, is that you have the same potential as Christ.  The evil done in the mainstream hi-jacking of Christ is this very point, you have put him on a pedestal, instead of heeding his exhortation to you all as brothers. (Millions have made the same mistake with Buddha). It is likely now that you will call me a blasphemer, as the mainstream Jews also called Jesus in his day. "He\'s making himself out to be God!" you\'ll say.  Brothers, we all come from the Father of Spirits. Life only exists by the breath of the Spirit of God.  There is only One Spirit.  Do you not remember in Genesis "Let Us make man in Our Own Image."\nYour spirit did not spring into existence with your conception into this life. You think your spirit has a beginning, but somehow will have no end? Brothers, that which has a beginning also has an end. If you believe your spirit had a beginning, then know it must also have an end--but this is not the truth.  As this physical universe had a beginning, it will also have an end, returning to its Source. From emptiness to this ever expanding infinite relative universe and back to nothing again. But your soul is a part of the Father. This is why the Scripture says, "You shall be Holy, for I am Holy." You already exist in perfection, but the perfection has been covered over. You don\'t need to "act" righteous. Such false notions only leave you being white-washed tombs. The outside appears clean while the mind is still unclean.  Remove what covers your True Nature and you will no longer need to "act" righteous.  You will Be Righteousness.  This is what Christ exemplified. This is the beginning of the True message of Christ.\n\nThis is not a doctrine of godhood, and don\'t get it confused with the Mormon doctrine. It\'s nothing of the sort. This is also not a "new age" doctrine that sprouted up lately.  It predates even Abraham. In fact, some believe this is the ancient source of the monotheism that Abraham is credited with.  I attest to you that this is how "Enoch walked with God, and was not, for God took him."  It may be hidden from your eyes at this point. But you have been robbed of the complete truth, my brothers. Instead of increasing what you were given, you have been taught to bury your one talent in the sand.\n\nYou speak of the wide and the narrow ways. Do you not realize that currently 1 in 3 people in the world are Christians--in the same basic manner, same basic doctrine--that you are?  Yes, you have your fundamentals, you may go round believing someone like the Pope and his followers are going to hell--or others that don\'t follow your particular creed of Christianity, which essentially differs by a jot here and a tittle there.  I\'m familiar with your position, as I said, I came from among you. But there are a much smaller number of people that realize the truth in what I am telling you than even your fundamentalist numbers. The precious few that realize this truth is a tiny fraction of even your most modest of fundamentalist numbers.\n\nRemember Jesus talking about the rich man and the difficulty of the rich to enter the Way--comparing  it to the camel entering the eye of the needle? What is the meaning of the small gate? It was the tiny gate within the big gate guarding the city of Jerusalem that (after hours) camels had to get on their knees to get through, the "eye of the needle" it was called.  The camel had to be stripped of all materials and crawl through on its honches. This is symbolic of the need for us to remove attachments to temporal things, attachment to passions, and humble ourselves by removing the false mind of the ego and projections of the "rational" mind. Very hard for rich men, but also very difficult for all of us so centered on this ego, so reliant on this rational mind and so attached to this physical and temporal world. I mean you no offense, but there is a lot of ego being slung around with your defense of your truth, brothers. Religious ego is one of the most deceitful aspects of ego to overcome (Don\'t I know it, for I see it also in myself). But I\'m moment to moment learning to take every thought captive.\nTo have the mind of Christ, brothers, this rational mind must die and be transformed. This is the true rebirth of which Jesus spoke to Nicodemus about. Become as a child to enter the kingdom of heaven, Jesus said.  Little children know little of ego or false notions, literal word-bound doctrines or dogma. Things like these are the cause of the spiritual blindness that Jesus spoke of.  This is the blindness that closes your eyes to the truth, which is understood only in the light of the kingdom of heaven within us.\n\nThe "mind set on the flesh" represents a lot more than just a mind set on lust or other bodily weaknesses. The mind set on the flesh is the mind set on the human mind with its false sense of self. However, the "mind set on the Spirit," is the rare one who has set aside the false mind and has at least begun to allow God to make him/her know wisdom in the hidden part and renewing the mind--as revealed from your spirit--the Holy Spirit as Christ called it--your soul that is the "hidden part" that David spoke of that is connected always with God and is part of God as a wave is a part of the Ocean. The One IS the Ocean. We are like the waves that belong to it.\n\nIt is clear in the Bible that trusting in the flesh and blood leads to suffering and destruction. The truth is that to accept the narrow interpretations you have absorbed, to take the narrow views you have viewed scripture with is trusting in flesh and blood.  For it was flesh and blood that determined which books of the Bible are in and which are out. It was flesh and blood that told you the Bible you hold in your hand today, from Genesis to Revelation, is the "only truth revealed by God."  It is flesh and blood that, professing to be wise, has become foolish.\n\nThe saddest thing is this blindness to the fact that Jesus is the very example of what you yourself can be--what we all can be, if we  put aside ego and rid our minds of attachments, passions and false views and undertake this inner journey back to the Original Mind. This is the process by which one comes to know the truth, as revealed from within, when you make room for it.  In your ego mind, there is no room for truth to dwell.  While you defend your Jesus and your faith that you received, you deny the very Power of God within you to be as He is. Jesus left false self and false views behind and what is left is the very Presence of God, Divine Love in action. Jesus never had to stop and think what was right or wrong to do. It flowed from his Being. He didn\'t have to go off and come up with his sermons, his words arose spontaneously according to the expedient need of the listeners.\nAs the scripture says after listing some of the fruits of the Spirit (which describe some of the inherent qualities of God (Love, Joy, Peace, Patience, Gentleness...) then the exhortation is given, "...against such things there is no law." When one removes the blockages, these are the kind of things that flow out from just Being.  This is the freedom of which Jesus spoke that he promised knowing the Truth would bring.  Which one of you is this free?  Then can you really say what you know is true?\nThis is the kind of Beauty that flowed from Christ.  But in that flowing Jesus broke some fundamentals of  the law, didn\'t he? For example, he broke the Sabbath...technically. He healed on the Sabbath. He walked too far and they rolled wheat with their hands to feed themselves...on the Sabbath. This is why adhering to word for word letter of doctrine will never suffice.  Jesus, having realized His True Self, was free of law and also free of what you call sin.  And he pointed the way to awaken from that state of blindness. In truth, all the many things you call "sins" are really just manifestations of the ONE sin, which is to be blind to the True Nature of Reality, being subject to the whims and deceit of your own human mind--your own ego; being attached to the trappings of this life.  "You are in this world, but not of this world."\n\nLaw and doctrines are there for expedient means, to get us to see the false and enter the inner path to truth. Absolute Truth cannot be confined to words, my brothers.  It may shock your system (as it did mine) every bit as much as Jesus teachings and actions shocked the religious understanding of the day, but the gospel you received was incomplete and misguided. I know you love God, and I know you are here defending the faith as you understand it, and may God bless you for the intention.  But there is a much deeper truth. This Truth is as formless as God.  As indefinable as God.  As beginningless and endingless as God.  The best of Bible verses can only point to it, like the sonar reflections from the great depths of the ocean can only vaguely describe the detail of the ocean floor and the contents of the sea.  Scripture says you could fill the world with books about it, and still not know the full story.  The words are a finger pointing to the moon.  Don\'t be stuck on the finger, try to see the moon those words can only point to.  The truth can only be revealed by Spirit inside of you when the path is clear.  The rational mind--the ego mind, is Its enemy.\n\nTake a step back, search your hearts and stop the outward journey.  Overcome the obstacles that blind you. Home will only be found when you lay aside all entanglements and begin the journey within.\n\nPeace to you.'

4	"This is my first time reading about the Friessens.  I liked the characters but felt like the book was too short and didn't really let me get to know much about them.  Perhaps if I had read the earlier books I might feel differently.  I was gifted with the book for an honest review."
4	"I read a lot of books and have found myself not finishing many of them lately. Either they felt like manufactured drama, immature or just poor writing and  I couldn't bring myself to finish them. This book I devoured!! I really enjoyed the story, the characters and writing style. I enjoy all types of books and I would consider this a nice easy read. Will definitely be looking out for more books by this author."

It talked about email marketing. It sounds like an interesting subject but this book is definitely not for everyone. I knew before hand the subject matter of this book, I would not have purchased it but since I already did, I read and is interesting but may be difficult to read through if you are not interested in making money of of an email list serve.

3	'This KiKi book, I found a little different. It was very easy to see "who done it" early on in the book. I enjoy the way these books are written and always find them cozy reading. This book ended very abruptly at 62% of my Kindle. Everything came together in one page. I did not care for that.'

3	"First off, this story is part romance novel and part military adventure. Stone has told two stories by switching back and forth between chapters. One story delivers the main characters love life and falling in love. The other is about his action serving as an Apache helicopter pilot in Afghanistan. The action of flying against insurgents in support of troops is both exciting and exhilarating. The mixing of the two story lines really does little for the other, in fact I found it distracted from what otherwise could have been a great story on the Apache's roll in combat."
3	"Spoilers -- since some of the abuse could cause triggers...\n\nSummary:  Abused woman flees to Colorado to make new life and recover.  She's an artist and get a job painting murals for a psycho interior designer in new high end mansions and gets into a relationship with the builder of said mansions.  They f like rabbits.  She eventually quits working for the pyscho and goes out on her own with help from the boyfriend builder.  To seek revenge for leaving her, psycho exboss has her kidnapped and shipped back to psycho abusive exboyfriend.  Builder, with help from a black ops guy (who was the most interesting character in this book, BTW... and I don't love that much suspense in my romance novels), rescue her.\n\nWriting of this book was not very sophisticated but this allowed the descriptions of the abuse scenes to not be too graphic... I've read much more disturbing scenes.\n\nNot too many typos, but WAY TOO MUCH cheesy schmaltzy romantic language.  And, I just couldn't understand how she'd get into a relationship with the builder, who has severe anger management issues and scares her... but it's okay because he's handsome and rich and eligible and everyone in town loves him and he gives money to the women's shelter... and that makes it okay???  That was a hard pill for me to swallow."

3	'Rating Edit - 3.5 Stars\n\nSaved in Sri Lanka is the first book that I read from the author, and I must say that it was a great start.\n\nThis book is a package deal - you get the love story and a virtual tour of Sri Lanka. Both these components of the plot are done very well. I enjoyed how the love story progressed; it was endearing, yet realistic. The virtual tour of the country too was written very well; the author ensures that the reader is not just a distant observer, but that he/she takes the trip around Sri Lanka along with Daniel and Sepalika.\n\nHaving said that, I felt the details about the country, slowed down the love story a bit. I really would have loved to read more about the love story, rather than Sri Lanka.\n\nHowever, that is simply my personal preference; history is just not my thing. But I can see how the track is important to the plot, as Sepalika is a Sri Lankan tour guide, and Daniel, a history professor, and they bonded over their common love for history.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the authors storytelling, and I would certainly read more from her.\n\nDisclaimer: I won this book in a giveaway.\n\nFind more book reviews @ http://shanayatales.com/bookreviews/'

2	'I appreciate the efforts of the author to write this book, however I thought that it would provide an in-depth look at how to make $5,000 using the Amazon FBA program. One of the author\'s tips is that you must have systems in place, but he adds, "I am not going to go into major detail in terms of specific systems and how to create one, but I want to drill into your head why it is so important that you have them." He then goes on to say that you should evaluate the efficiency of your daily task to determine if there is a better way to accomplish them.\n\nThere are no checklists or templates. Details would make this a more useful book.'
4	"I love this series (Surviving Series).  Will and Emily's explosive relationship is a fun read, and let's not forget the other characters that we've already introduced to in the other books.  Will sure surprised me ( in a good way).  I hope there is another book. Can't wait."
4	"My Review:\nI have debated and debated how to rate this book...anywhere from an A rating down to a B...which has A- and B+ in between (so that's more of a spread than it sounds like). The tough thing is...I loved reading the book. The experience itself was really good. I liked the book.\n\nWhat I didn't like were these two characters and what they stand for. They are NOT nice guys. Both Dima and X are mob bosses, fighting for territory in NYC. They are brutal, vicious, and their lives are filled with drugs, gun-running, and prostitution...and they're okay with that. Even with the fact that people are dying because of them. See, not nice guys. But what Avril Ashton does with these two men is brilliant because she made them empathetic. I wanted them to find their happily ever after, whether they honestly deserved it or not. There is NO character growth arc in this book. They are mean mothers at the beginning and they stay that way until the end. And I mean that seriously. These guys are NOT guys you ever want to have a run in with, because they will kill you without a second thought. Heck, they love one another and that still doesn't keep them from physically, awfully hurting one another.\n\nBut even in the gritty, dark underworld of this book, I found moments of redeeming qualities between these two. Their love is so incredibly unlikely. It made me root for them more. These are not guys who easily have/develop emotions, so when they do, that vulnerability is attractive AND that's what drew me to the characters and this story.\n\nIt's a haunting story, and even though I had my issues with the bones of the set-up, I'll admit I went and one-clicked the next three in the series. Maybe this series will be my dirty little secret (which I'm sharing with all of you)...I don't want to like the characters and what they stand for, but I just can't help myself."
4	'This book is an excellent collection of stories about black heroes during a time when blacks were not even considered citizens although they possessed character despite the adversaries and adversity. A compelling lesson for Blacks in 2014 and beyond'
4	"This story was quick and easy to read. I did wonder if the story line of the break in at Ginny's store would become a dramatic point in the story, but it really didn't. This is a straight up romance and I honestly didn't realise (my own fault) that this was a love triangle. I massively dislike reading these, however this one was not as bad as I feared once I realised the path that was being taken. Ginny made her decision pretty early on so it wasn't all left to the last minute. There was plenty of steam and all three characters were enjoyable to read. It was also nice to get all of their POV. I did find the formatting to be a small issue. I always have my font size on my kindle set to the smallest writing, so after a chapter or so the font became much larger, however I was stuck with the larger font because I already had it set to as small as it would go. It changed back after a few chapters, but it was a bit annoying to have to read the larger writing which I'm not used to. I'm unsure if this was the author submitting the manuscript to Amazon incorrectly, or just Amazon messing it up. It's a small complaint in the scheme of things though.\n\nOverall I enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone looking for a hot read that isn't too heavy and wants to be able to read something in one night."
2	'I would have given it three stars because of the effort to include archaic language to preserve Regency time and place, but the short of it is that this novel is nothing but repetition. Elizabeth is not really a "Darcy"; Lady Catherine is offended; Cousin Collins is disapprovingly absurd; Caroline Bingley lords it over Elizabeth; Wickham is jealous of her position in the family; while the Darcys and Fitzwilliams, one and all, are entirely accepting and utterly adore her.  Over and over and over. One scene after another, whoever has the temerity to point out that Elizabeth is "just a founding," every Darcy participating in the scene says the same thing again and again about Elizabeth being one of them, really, because of how thoroughly she is loved.  I could go on and on, but I would just myself have to repeat and repeat and repeat the exact same thing. The entire book nothing more than a series identical vignettes, acted out in a variety of locals. In addition, there is no real suspense, as the intent of the plot is blatantly obvious. There is no development of the relationship between Elizabeth and Darcy - basically, it is simply announced. There is no subtlety to hold your interest.\n\n And aside from all this, there appears to have been no proof reading whatsoever. I sincerely estimate that every four to five pages, there is a glaring error - two verbs, so you can\'t tell which is intended; no verb at all; words entirely out of sequence, so the meaning is entirely garbled; etc. These errors are throughout the book, and so numerous as to be insulting to the reader. Since the author demands payment for her work- a sign of a professed professional- then shouldn\'t she expend effort to produce a professional product? Honestly, I wonder that she isn\'t embarrassed to issue such sloppy material.'
4	'Good read.  Some of the areas of the book were predictable but others had a nice twist.  the book provided a good mix of romance, empowerment, chivalry and love.  The main character had given up on love but the right person was able to penetrate her heart.'
2	"The kindle version is pretty terrible.  Pictures are garbled and missing and the descriptions sometimes don't match the illustration."

4	"Walker starts off with a big boom, right in the middle of some pretty crazy life saving or killing action depending on which side you are on. The pace Rie set in this book doesn't slow down. It is fast paced, full of mystery & intrigue add in some aggressive steamy hot sex, damn!\n\nWalker is all business and pure danger, strong, determined, a mighty warrior and Jade is his female version, just in a smaller more compact smoking body. The passion that these characters put towards their work is quickly seen in who they care for others.\n\nUnder their hard walls they keep firmly in place are hearts that have been broken, can these two find healing that they both so desperately want and need in order to move forward and survive? Can they find their second chance?\n\nI just know that I am going to love this series just as much as I did the California Bad\nBoys. I can't wait to see what Rie has in store for us with Justice.\n\nAdvanced copy provided in exchange for an honest review."
3	'Too much focus on the evil Swedes.'
3	"This was a pretty mild BWWM novel. It would be good for someone who does not like steamy sex scenes. There definitely could have been a little more romance and less of the ridiculous lie that Rachel kept up. The book overall was OK, but I wouldn't recommend it and I probably won't read more by this author. I wasn't really engaged in this book, which is unfortunate because the synopsis was intriguing."

4	"Rounding up from 3.5 stars!\n\nParker's Honor is book two in the Prospect Springs Shifter series and follows along the first book, Blaze of Glory but in Parker and Lynn's point of view. It's another fun quick read in this world of cowboys and steampunkish machines which I am thoroughly enjoying. Parker was instantly attracted to Lynn and claims her right away even though he doesn't quite understand why he feels so possessive over her. He just knows that she is his and he needs to keep her close. Lynn is just as attracted to Parker but doesn't quite know how to handle his desire and possessiveness.\n\nWe get to meet more of the McSweeny clan and I have to say how much I adored Parker's parents! The interactions between Parker and his mama, just LOL! Nothing can knock an alpha down off his high horse quicker than his mama!\n\nMy only complaint and the reason why I dinged a half star off my review is because the conflict and ending were a little rushed in my opinion. I understand that it's a short story but I felt that it was wrapped up a bit too quickly. However, it was still a smexy fun afternoon read and I can't wait to see what comes next.\n\n*I received a copy from the author in exchange for an honest review"
4	"This book was pure torture and frustration.\nMan can be so dumb sometimes, I honestly felt like slapping the hell out of these two.\nBut Derek will probably enjoy that too much and Chase will get a kick out of watching it.\nSo, Derek and Chase, a sub that wants to submit, a Dom that wants to top and a hell of miscommunication.\nThe setting for the book, a leather convention, is the first thing that strikes as super original for the book.\nThe sexual tension between the MC is strong and frustrating.\nThe sex scenes are amazingly done, intense and gives the reader the whole feeling of a real D/s scene.\nIs kinky, is sexy, is BDSM in a different level, and is the end is also a romance, but don't expect chocolates and flowers.\nThese two are all about floggers and collars.\nLove it!"
4	'This is an amazing idea: A way to describe the entire LGBT-experience using the same character side-by-side traveling on different parts of that same journey.'
3	'This book took far longer to read than it should have.  Having three male characters whose names started with C and then mixing them up requires the reader to stop and figure out what is meant.  Words were missing, words were added, making the read "bumpy."\n\nBesides the proof reading, all of the men in this book were childish and borderline cuckoo.'

Find out in this fast paced romp into possibilities.\nI had my doubts when I started this but in the end I couldn't put it down.  It ended a little abruptly but all in all a fascinating read."
4	'The Good Morning Man by Paul Loewen is a touching story about a young girl in a small town that just seems to have problem after problem piling up and she doesn\'t know who to turn to for help... until she meets the Good Morning man.\n\nThe main character, Asia, is a twelve year old girl. She is interesting and her approach in the story is one of innocence and a child\'s understanding of the world. For the most part I thought Paul stuck very well to keeping her sounding like her age while still bringing in the deeper aspects of the story.\n\nAsia takes us through the lives of people in the small community and allows us to meet the enigma that is the Good Morning man. He is a mystery throughout the story. He brings cheer and healing wherever he goes but is it because of his good outlook on life and friendliness, or, as he puts it "sometimes people just need someone to listen"? Or is there something more going on beneath the surface?\n\nI especially loved how Paul Loewen writes the town. From the very first description I felt as if I was right beside Asia making my way past "The Other Place" and the second hand store.\n\nThe dialogue in the story was, at times, stiff. But When it was it was usually because of an adult to child conversation and fit into the situation. When there was peer to peer conversations they flowed well and the dialogue seemed to fit the age group.\n\nPaul Loewen writes a fantastic book with characters you can relate to, a very real feeling setting, and a touching story to tie it all together.\n\nThe Good Morning Man is religious story, with religious themes throughout the book. I thought it was well done, incorporating some bible stories and bringing up faith conversations when they made sense. I never felt as if it was being forced in. However, I did feel like a couple times it did border on a little bit preachy.\n\nI\'m giving The Good Morning Man 4 out of 5 stars due to a couple small formatting issues, and the occasional preachy feel. That being said it is a fantastic book and very touching. I highly recommend this book.'
4	'This quite a different take on the Zombie story, but it was a very enjoyable read.\nI like this authors writing style.\nSometimes you gotta just use your imagination & have some fun.\n I also read the authors book about the Killer Koalas and it was also a blast reading it.'
4	"Solid effort for a self published author. Could use a little editing for typos and continuity but there wasn't so much it was distracting. One thing is I thought it felt rushed towards the end. Could be fleshed out a bit more. All in all I enjoyed the story though!"
4	'I purchased this as a duo for one reason (besides it being an awesome JS read)- it was a bundle.  I like when Ms. Jordan bundles her stories that are related (same characters) together.  I find reading easier due to the fact that when I finish the first book I do not have to return to my kindle menu to find the related book to continue with their storyline.  The price was right as well.\n\nI found the storyline in this book full of twists and turns as well as being fast paced.  I was able to read this book over 2 days and was pleased with the end results.  I would love to know about Dmitri\'s "brothers" and how they came to their HEAs.  But maybe that is not for us to know just that they got them.'
1	"Introverts hates going to conference, of course. So the solution, is to invite a guy that is going to the same conference, to a coffee meeting before the actual conference.\n\nI failed to see how inviting a complete stranger, through internet, one on one face to face, suck any less. In fact, I rather go to that conference instead of going through the invitation process.\n\nAnd did she just cited the Wikipedia as reference? seriously?\n\nThe solution to gain visibility to upper management, is, one-on-one coffee meeting, again, this time with the upper management people, brilliant.\n\nOh, she did cited the Wikipedia, again, seriously.\n\nFinishing the book is like, oh my god, wtf did I just read.\n\nGuys, don't buy this book, I normally don't do reviews, but this one sucked so bad that I feel I have the responsibility to warn the world. You know, like those old commercial that has a guy that has cancer telling people not to smoke.\n\nWell, it's just like that, don't buy this book, and, smoking is probably bad for you too."

4	'The books were well constructed, but a bit gory for me. I have to say that I did appreciate the writing style of the author.\nThe plots were quite ingenious and varied from book to book. The writer brought her characters to life, the good, the bad and the not so good.  Although I was warned by the advertising blurb that they were not for the faint of heart, I just took that as a bit of hyperbole.\nBut it was not: it was quite true, and this reader, although admittedly faint of heart, continued to the last page of the last book.\nI did like the braggadocio of some of the characters and believe the series to be well worth acquiring, unless, like me, you are really a bit faint of heart.'

3	"'The Professor's Assasin' is not quite a prequel to Pearl's latest novel 'The Technologists'. It is a short story about the William Barton Roders, who founded Boston Tech which became MIT. This story takes place when Rodgers is a professor at the University of Virginia.  After some student riots, the head Professor is shot. Suspects are all around, but strangely before the professor dies, he refuses to reveal his assassin. Rodgers takes it upon himself to solve this mystery. Who shot the professor and why would the professor want to take that secret to his grave?\n\nThis is a nice story, but essential to the larger story in 'The Technologists'. Pearl gives us a glimpse into the early years at UVA. A time before the civil war and the end of slavery. It was interesting to learn a bit more about Rodgers' character. It is a short story and not difficult to read."
3	'By its title alone, "Bees in America: How the Honey Bee Shaped a Nation," one gets the sense that this book, authored by Tammy Horn, explores and explains the intersection between the honey bee and the historical development of the United States. My conclusion after having read the book is that Horn explains how the honey bee was shaped by the development of the United States, especially in a sociological sense. Suppose that X="honey bees" and Y="historical development of the USA," it seems that Horn\'s thesis is that X, in part, led to Y. I disagree. Considering the many examples in Horn\'s book, it appears instead that Y led to many of the historical developments related to X.\n\nGiven my personal  experience as a beekeeper, I was very interested in reading this book. Many reviewers state that Horn\'s book is a tour de force among publications concerning honey bees. There is no doubt that the book is well written, overall, but it seems to be excessively concerned about the relationship between honey bees and social constructs (e.g., women\'s movement, racial divides) rather than any other sort of history associated with honey bees (e.g., industrial/market history, scientific understanding, natural history).\n\nHence, I found that the scope of the book clearly focused on social history, much of which I interpreted as being coincidental rather than cause-and-effect. For instance, Horn\'s seems rather at awe in her numerous discussions regarding the involvement of women in beekeeping; namely, who would have ever thought that women would be keep honey bees?! Put into proper context, however, women have always been involved in agricultural occupations, chores, pursuits, etc. Women were milking cows when America was settled, so why should it be either odd or particularly fascinating that they would be involved in keeping honey bees? Putting food on the table is important - regardless if you are a man or woman. Personally, I felt that too much effort was expended in describing the social impact of honey bees - when most of these impacts were coincidental rather than cause-and-effect related. Hence, I find the the title of the book is a bit deceiving.\n\nRegardless, the book does have many redeeming qualities that I appreciate. The book is written in a time sequential format - honey bees in Europe, brought to America, and then a decade-by-decade history. Numerous vignettes are provided throughout the book that are both interesting and educational. I **very much appreciated** Horn\'s use of endnotes, many of which I investigated in more detail. If you are interested in honey bees or beekeeping, then I would recommend that you read and keep this book; the endnotes in themselves provide a "go to" source for additional information.\n\nI would recommend some editorial changes if the book were to be reissued. First, the images included in the book are of very poor quality, most likely due to the printing process and quality of paper used in publishing the book. They are of so poor quality that they somewhat distract from what Horn has written. Second, there is considerable repetition of facts throughout the book. Facts need only be stated once and then built upon. Third, it appears as Horn\'s editor stopped making corrections two-thirds of the way into the book. While the first two-thirds are well written and constructed, from an editorial point of view, the last one-third is very disjointed and does not flow well at all; one has to slog through the last one-third. This made for awkward reading. In the last one-third of the book, scientific issues related to honey bees are directly positioned adjacent to social issues concerning honey bees, as if they went hand-in-hand together (they don\'t). There is certainly room for improvement with regard to the editorial quality of this book.'

3	'Change of Skies is a coming of age Historical Fiction set in the 1950s. Sue is discontented with her life, believing all her mother is concerned with is her young twin brothers, and decides to return to England. She tells her mother is enrolling in art school but her only thought is escaping her boring life in Tasmania.\n\nThe story follows Sues life in England as she makes new friends and reconnects with an old friend of her mothers. Alternating between Stevies (Sues mother) life in Tasmania as she starts to daydream about what might have been if she had followed a different path.\n\nIll start by saying Pakemans writing is beautiful, descriptive and elegant. However even that could not negate the awful characters. Sue had self esteem problems and was jealous of everyone and blamed her mother for everything in her life. Maybe I could understand this behaviour if Sue was 16 but she was 22. The mother had a lovely husband and step-son but moped around all day thinking of some past male friend and the what-ifs.\nDavid Jones was a total jerk!! His thoughts..\nI have this theory, he went on, as if she had not said anything, that experienced men should initiate young women and vice versa. I usually keep it to myself, it goes down like a lead balloon in polite society. He grinned. Another lesson or two and you will be ready to teach that young man of yours how to make love to a desirable woman.\n\nThe story was all wrapped up neatly at the end.\n\nI will be giving this author another try as the writing was engaging. I only hope her other books have more likeable characters.'

1	"I didn't like the conclusion I felt April was a doormat and ran after Sean not my cuppa as it relates to romance novels."
3	"Not horrible but not stellar either. This was a free book and it is just a collection of chapters of books written by the Author. There is potential in many of the stories, but I have not made up my mind yet if I will purchase other books from this author. There are some spelling and grammatical errors, but not so glaring that I couldn't enjoy the stories. Sex scenes were repetitive and didn't flow well. That is just my opinion and I do think the author has some great ideas."

I gave it three stars because I wanted to know how Barrett and Tavis's marriage ended up and I felt like there was not enough to the story not to mention I'm not really into eroticas. I would need at least a part two in order to give this book a higher rating. Good short read for an erotica."
4	"This was a very short and interesting read from Nichole White.\nI quite like this take on the Fae, and was pleasantly suprised at the amount of world building she managed to fit into such a short story.\nThe narrative flow was a little stilted at times, speech patterns were much too proper to be believable without some sort of reason for it. However that's a small gripe with an otherwise very good story.\nI feel like this works very well as an introduction to a larger series and I really hope the author intends to write more about Mara and her missions as a F.A.H (That's Fairies Among Humans for those of you who are not fae)I know I would buy them if she did!"
2	'Purchased in error but seems typical of this type of writing.'
4	'I loved the story and characters immensely satisfying to read. BUT this was simply to short a story!!! I read it in about half an hour!!!'
3	'The mystery was interesting but more historical facts and a mire fluid writing style would have helped. Overall the book was an easy read .'
4	'Full of angst and action. A captivating journey with Jess that would inspire anyone starting out on their own. The romance that blossoms between her and Tyler is magical, yet something always felt off. The cliffhanger is perfect and left me definitely wanting more. Provided by author in exchange for an honest review.'
4	'I was given this book for an honest review.\nThis is an adult twist on a classic fairytale.\nNieve the princess is hated by her stepmother who is a witch. She sent a hunter (who is a bear shifter) to kill Nieve. But he fell in love with her and changed those plans.\nThis is a short story, fast paced and fun to read.'
4	'It was a good series, but surely there is more I hope. At first I did feel the characters popping out then I started to feel the connection between the two of them so that is why I title it Mr. & Miss. Smith the love & hate relationship towards outsiders.'
4	'I enjoyed this book.'
2	'I tried very hard to stick with this book, but when the author uses upwards of five adjectives in one sentence to describe one thing, and then crafts two more sentences to describe that same thing, it gets tedious.  Sometimes the word choices made little sense to the scene.  For example:\n\n"I looked at both of them directly, smiled, and then slowly and firmly walked in, and gradually walked away from them."\n\nWhat does it mean to walk firmly? But then gradually? Perhaps this wasn\'t my reading style, but I found myself pondering the author\'s phrasing choices far more often than actually absorbing the story being told.\n\nAlso:\n"As I stood still there, fully captivated and mesmerized from the stunning beauty of the amazing place, I heard a unique mixture of whistling incessantly emanating from the frictions from the twigs and leaves of the trees and the continuous dropping of the leaves."\n\nI thought the premise was interesting, but I wish the author had been far less verbose in his telling of it.'
2	'Very basic biography about this incredible man. nothing new though, and quite short. Same basic info found in other biographies.'
1	"If I had read Sandy Milan's review before purchasing this pornography, I would not have purchased it.  The H is a cruel, randy, rutting male whore who is far from morality.  Raped by your husband is not something that you accept and have no issues with, and I am speaking from experience!  What was the author thinking and what kind of person is he/she to conjure such a story????"
3	'The book provides information on some cities the author visited, including one or two hotels and restaurants she recommends for each of those cities. Unfortunately I will not be visiting any of those cities or have already been there. But i do not pretend much more than that for the value I paid for the book'
4	'Hi,\n\nI have study international trade in school and for myself since 1998, I have hundreds of books about international trade, and I have the title "International trade specialist" ITS degree.\n\nThis book was unique in its content and I liked it. It is rare that operation in international trade of this detail comes out in a book, that makes it special. I know it will be useful for me, if I use the trading method or not. This book has a lot lessoned learned and told, and in this proffession one can never say; I know i all!\n\nI just finished the book, and I am a bit overwhelmed, first of all it is a good book, and it is "to the point" about tips of the specific "pros and cons" all over, very practical but also theoretical meaning and insightful.\n\nIt is obvious that David Giovanni has many years experience as he know his way around, specially about the "structure of a deal" what works and what don\'t work. He is narrow but I guess that is the point in a "how to book" If this method work, which I can\'t say for real just yet, it is indeed valuable information one can make operating procedures and create contracts from in trading with international commodities.\n\nHowever, some aspect I think personally that I miss.\n\n- First of all I miss a overview of trading in the beginning, specially about the similarities and differences concerning traditional day/ short traders in commodities that deal with futures, derivatives, stocks, bonds etc, tied up to commodities. And the world of real physical trading as the book is about. However, Giovanni is clear about splitting up shipping, title to goods/ documentation and the process of collection, payment/ banking operation that deal with transaction work.\n\n- Second, I think insurance was not properly covered in this book as it is imperative in trading, and risk management, also for the intermediary that at some point of time actually has "title to the goods" with this method, even the intermediary has signed contract between the seller and the buyer, the operation order is not only a delicate matter, but there is no room for errors certain places before risks gets big. Also the risk of currency fluctations and choice of currency for a collecting time of 90 days should be considered in this book as an important element, which was not.\n\n- Third point and vital, Since Giovanni build his method on ICC world-wide trusted publications such as UCP600 and Incoterms 2000 (now updated Incoterms 2010) I miss a guideline to or comments on ICC\'s model contract, that should be just as important as those clauses mentioned. Giovanni mention these ICC contracts are expensive to use which is not the case in my experiance, and specially when we are dealing in the millions of dollars-deal, what could be more important! However, Giovanni outline his own set of rules and contract clauses which only he knows are perfect for the work!\n\nThis is not a book you read front to back and say you are done, no this little masterpiece is a intricate handbook for a certain type of intermediary trading that has to guide operation of intermediary commodity trading. This book could be for the savvy trader that already has knowledge in international trade but did not yet close a deal, or want to lower the risk and improve operational quality and frequency of trading and closing deals. Giovanni is honest and say that to pull this off, in this internet traders "wannabees" in this scam and fraud environment that one has to "compete" with will not be easy, but it is possible with knowledge, skills, patient and eyes on the details.\n\nThis trading method is subjective, and must follow strict terms and conditions created in a deal structure by the intermediary and suggested in the quote and sales agreement to both the buyer and seller. There is little room for the buyer and the seller to negotiate their own terms and conditions before the deal stall and fall apart. The question rises; how this will interact in communication in reality as a trader set up agains the big players of professional commodity companys that have their own "rules of trade" what incoterms to accept, risk to take etc. And maybe an interesting question is why should an "end buyer" want to purchase from an intermediary and not the producer of commodity. I don\'t say thay will not, I just say this has to be answered before one intermediary start doing a serious move to become an international commodity trader.\n\nBest regards\nTommy'
2	"I can't believe this has as many positive reviews as it does. It's incredibly slow moving, the characters are one-dimensional and predictable, and the writing is stilted and choppy. There are so many holes in the plot line, it's almost laughable. It's almost like there's an entire past storyline among the characters that the author just assumes you should know. I know it's only $.99, but seriously, don't waste your dollar unless you really don't have anything better to do. There's a reason this trilogy is so cheap. If you're into vampire stories, there are countless better ones out there."

1	"What can I possibly say about the Communist Manifesto?  It is awful.  But everyone should read it.  Also read about Stalin and Lenin.  If you want to know what Communism will give you, read about Mao.  It is never a happy ending.  I started reading about Karl Marx when relatives of mine said Socialism isn't Communism.  I didn't know enough to argue either way.  So I spent over a year researching the topic.  What I learned was Communism comes in with tanks and takes over.  Socialism uses a more covert path of infiltration.  Sneaking into systems with lies and entitlements.  But no system can withstand the entitlements indefinitely and the system will collapse.  From the collapse springs Communism.  Just look at the financial situation in Europe to see how Socialism collapses countries.  Exactly where America is heading."

1	'Terrible stories. Poor plots, poorly written.'
4	'I believe in romance and the Happily Ever After - so why read (and recommend) a book about divorce?\n\nBecause what\'s worse than being unpartnered, is being mated with someone in a loveless relationship. A marriage doesn\'t have to contain infidelity, substance abuse, mental illness, etc., to be miserable - it just has to lack love, even if it boasts a big house and plenty of toys, including some for the kids, too.\n\nDisclaimer: Lisa Thomson is a "blog friend" of mine, and I like her writing style and life outlook, so I was disposed to like this book.\n\nThe book is a combination of how-to and memoir. Many of Lisa\'s experiences will be different from those of other women: she\'s Canadian, she and her (now-ex) husband were very well off; they had children aged eight and ten at the time she began divorce filings, AND her husband was employed by a family business, which made things even more complicated.\n\nSome of the resources, especially legal ones, will be different from yours (especially if you do not live in Canada), but yours may be even better; do not assume there is no (free) help out there, you may just have to ask. One point I want to throw in: it\'s advised you consult with at least five lawyers, to find one who is a good fit for you, and NOT blindly hire the first one you meet. Even if you KNOW you do not want to hire the priciest, sharkiest, ball-busting attorney out there, if you think even for a moment that your stbx (soon-to-be-ex) might hire this person, go for an initial consultation, because in most places, this makes them unable to accept your stbx as a client, due to conflict of interest. Consider that good lawyers are pretty expensive, but not-so-good lawyers generally wind up being even more so.\n\nThe samples provided of legal bills, budgets, and such are invaluable. I am not wholly on board with the letters written and used as examples for trying to win back children being alienated by an ex. IMO, it is wrong to try to "guilt" children into being more loyal to you. Remind them of good times together, absolutely, assure them that your love is unwavering regardless of where they live and what they do, and provide them a safe emotional environment for them where they do NOT feel like a dog\'s rope toy, being tugged between the two sides.\n\nBesides relationships with your children, relationships with friends and family will be impacted, too - this too is addressed. Financial issues, budgeting and investing - all covered, with resources for further reading on all subjects.\n\nIf you are involved in a situation where there is already physical violence, or the threat of such, this book may be helpful to read, but you should ALSO consult with the hotlines and resources for those volatile and dangerous situations.\n\nI love this section: "How will I know when I have moved on? Because moving on is a process rather than an event, it doesn\'t just happen one day where you find yourself saying, \'Look, I\'ve finally moved on.\' Instead it happens every day in small ways until eventually you find months or years have gone by and you have made some significant changes..."\n\nAll in all, a helpful, informational, and yes, interesting book.'

4	'This review is written by Nic\'s wife.\n\nAt heart, I\'m a huge fantasy nerd. So I really enjoyed this. Diack\'s written tone is very well suited to the genre: very dry, and focused on concise descriptions of action and scene. Some of the dialogue could have been a little more lively, and I have a personal pet peeve about using modern colloquialisms like "OK" in epic fantasy. There were some spots where the dialogue combined with the tone of characterization elements to make things a little too far on the "tell" end of the "show vs. tell" spectrum. But aside from those, it was a very solid presentation. I read a bit of one of Diack\'s earlier books, and the tone didn\'t mesh as well with the content as this does. If you\'re looking for something in the tone of Tolkien, or classic C.S. Lewis, you\'ll enjoy this. It\'s not a terribly light read, due to the weight of the tone, but the sense of gravitas suits it well.\n\nI did have a few nitpicks with the pacing, particularly in the beginning, simply because so much background and so many historical events were discussed before we reach the main thrust of the story. But even those were entertainingly written, and I didn\'t mind the detour.'

4	"This is a different read for me, my genre as a rule is romance so how did I come to read this? I'd just had lunch with my friend yesterday and we were walking back when we noticed a guy stood in the centre of Leeds on what was a very hot day wearing a board which said 'If you like reading please take a leaflet' so we did and I figured if the poor guy could stand out all day trying to get word out about his book the least I could do was give it a try, so I did, I downloaded the sample when I got home and noticed it was available on KU.\nThis is a dystopian book aimed mainly for the young adult but suitable for all, I won't give my usual summary since the blurb is good and gives you enough to make you want to continue on.\nThis was a surprising read, it kept me entertained from start to finish my main worry at one point, well several points if I'm being honest is that this would be left open with either a cliffhanger or a 'to be continued' this was not the case.\nWhile this reminded me at times of several other books it's still very much it's own and it managed to surprise me several times and kept me guessing till the end. It's easy to lose yourself in this new world and I throughly enjoyed the journey, it's a clever read that's well written personally I would have liked a little more character development I didn't feel that I fully connected with any of them but I can appreciate it would be easy with a book like this for too many details to slow it down whereas it kept up a good pace as it was.\nI do love a good dystopian read, it's just that mine generally come with a romance in there as well\nLike I said this is not really my genre but I'm glad I picked up a leaflet and read this book and Ryan looks like a promising new author and I wish him well."

3	'AN APB PERSPECTIVE:\nIt was an okay read for me!  I am not sure how I feel about reading that a 58 year old teacher turned prostitute. I could understand why Mercy made the decisions she did, but there were other ways to come alive or find yourself again in order to make money. I enjoyed some of the characters and their stories, however I felt that The General would have been a better fit for Mercy other than Jack. I know that she had lost a lot of people she loved, but so had Melia and she kept a better head on her shoulders.  It was wonderful what Jack did for her, even though she was definitely "one mean bitch". I am not interested in Book 2 even though the book was well written, very good editing.'

4	'I received this book for free in exchange for an honest review. This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of my review.\n\nI have recently learned to admire and enjoy paranormal romance and its because of books such as Erin M. Leafs Dusk that I have become a fan. The story was original and imaginative and kept my attention throughout.\n\nThe story begins with Lucy Soren learning to overcome the trauma of being attacked by aliens called the Spiders. She was rescued by Sentry Solomon Dusk who made a last impression on her. Solomon could not get the beautiful Lucy off of his mind. The two are brought back together when the aliens return. As they work together to fight off the attack, the two cant resist falling in love.\n\nDusk is the second book in the Stronghold series. It continues the story that first started in Dark which I had not read. Because the story was a continuation, I found myself a bit lost at first. However, Ms. Leaf provided me with the necessary information that I was quickly able to understand what had happened in the previous book and fully enjoy this story.\n\nMs. Leaf has a vivid imagination that was evident on every page. She then took these grand ideas and described them with so much detail and authenticity that I was completely immersed in the universe she created.  Whether she was describing the aliens or the sentries or the various technologies they used, it was all so very real. I believed in it all.\n\nI believed in the relationship between Lucy and Solomon. Ms. Leaf did a wonderful job showing the different layers of these characters so that I understood their motivations, their fears and their strengths. As a result, their connection was strong and made complete sense to me.  All of the humans and sentries were likeable people that I could care about and root for.\n\nThe battle against the aliens was a nail biter and filled with drama and suspense.  Ms. Leaf built up the tension at the perfect pace so as to excite but not overwhelm the reader.  Once I began reading, I became engrossed and could not put the book down until it was finished. Quick warning though  while the romance does have a happy ending, the alien storyline is not resolved.\n\nWith two more Sentry brothers still single and the alien Spiders not yet eradicated, its obvious there is more to be told in this story. Dusk really intrigued me and kindled my interest in how the Sentries will prevail against the Spiders. Hopefully we will not have to wait long for the next installment in this ingenious series.'
2	'Overall I found the book boring because nothing exciting happened. The vents in the book were very predictable.  However, I did like the illustrations.'

Anna and Jon try to figure out who is behind these unfortunate events. Can they figure it? Will their feeling for each other bring them closer? Find out in this wonderful romantic suspense. This is a must read series.'
1	"Obviously written or translated by someone who's English language skills were not up to the task. Garbled at some points.  Disappointing."
3	'I\'m not feeling the forced seduction. While the H is asking for consent, the h is busy denying her feelings. Repeatedly. Multiple "no"s. And yet he keeps pushing and pushing. I usually like a good slow build, but this wasn\'t good, just uncomfortable. No rape occurs (in spite of the abduction), and no cheating, but still lots of cringe moments. Yes means yes, and no means stop, and there are other ways to build tension than to keep pushing against a no in the same scene. Sorry, not really into this one.'

4	"3.75 starsVulnerable, yet strong and oh-so very. MALE, I wanted to lick my way across Joes abs from the very first photo shoot.\n\nJoe is a firefighter who will burn up the pages. Hes internally conflicted and stubborn  not to mention physically and emotionally damaged. But when he meet Taylor at the photo shoot for a charity calendar, he wants to throw caution to the wind and just let the flames take over. Taylor, on the other hand, is a sensible girl. Shes working her ass off to make her photography business a success, but in the meantime she pays her bills by waitressing. Theres an instant connection between her and Joe  its actually a little embarrassing since Taylor cant seem to breathe properly when shes around him.\n\nJoe convinces Taylor to help him with his pet project: The Burn Book  [insert Mean Girls reference here]. Its not what you think  its actually a book that is meant to inspire and create beauty by taking photographs of burn victims. Taylors selflessness and philanthropic heart sears Joes soul. Shes the perfect one to help him and hell do anything to spend more time with her.\n\nAs they begin to come together, Joe needs to decide if hes willing to let his guard down and let Taylor in while Taylor struggles with dealing with a lingering ex boyfriend who refuses to stay away. I loved the inclusion of Joes family throughout the book. It gave him so much more depth as a character and it allowed for the many layers of Joe to be unpeeled. This book is serious, yet fun, and contains a fair amount of banter that will make you smile.\n\nOverall this book was incredibly sweet and is a quintessential contemporary romance: light, fun, sexy, not too much intense drama. You won't want to rip your hair out, but youll probably want to rip Joes clothes off  soooo, WIN.\n\n#yum\n\n[I received an ARC of this book via Netgalley in exchange for an honest review]"
3	'So, I like this book better than the first. In many ways, this book had what Devils Honor didntromance. Devils Mark is book #2 in The Devils Keepers Series. it was still hard to connect with the characters. The storyline had a steady pace, but the characters needed more development than what the length of the book provided. Other than the lack of character development the story was engaging.'

1	'This is a VERY short book... it should be a quick read. That is IF it was readable, but it\'s not.\n\nHere\'s the 1st line of the preface complete with improper capitalization and lack of punctuation just as it was published:\n\n"After tremendous struggle passing on and having a steady flow of Income zone I am passing on this information for Everyone who aspires living online with working mode, with capital mode and with gaming mode."\n\nThat I think I get what he\'s trying to convey but I gather that English is not the author\'s first language. I tried reading this "book" but couldn\'t make it through the preface. The writing doesn\'t get any better, so I quit trying to decipher what he was trying to say.\n\nDid you realize the BBB is the "Better Internet Bureau"? Or that you should "Look for a money back guarantee" to prevent being scammed?  Apparently, people that lie to you to take your money, won\'t lie about offering a money back guarantee. Wow, that\'s a load off my mind.\n\nI got it for free while it was on special and still think I paid too much for it.

From what I remember, corn can grow to full maturity and be ready to harvest in 60-100 days depending on the environment and the type of corn.

It is hard to find YA books that do not pander to the teens by embracing popular stereotypes and demonizing the parents. Fairy Texas doesnt do this.\n\nLaney Harris life is thrown into a tailspin when her mother remarries and moves to the small Texas town of Fairy. Shes not thrilled about it the changes, especially a brand new sister. Her mother and stepfather expect them to be pals. Think again. Then theres the one horse town that isn't exactly as it seems.\n\nHer new high school has some hot guys, and a couple are even interested in her. Unfortunately, her stepsister feels she had dibs on one. Then theres the dead kid she stumbles over and the school counselor with invisible wings. Laney sees them well enough, but others dont. If that isn't weird enough, theres a prophecy about a sacred one. Ironically, a few of The People thinks shes the one.\n\nMargo Bond Collins writes a tight, well-paced mysterious tale that keeps you guessing until the end. I like the fact that Laney was an ordinary girl with a quick wit and a faster tongue. Two thumbs up.\n\nThe book was provided free of charge for a honest review."

Don't get me wrong the story line is awesome and I will read the rest of the series once it s published but when thinking of Fifty Shades and this story it's to similar except it doesn't get as deep with BDSM as Christian did...great story though can't wait to read the rest."
4	'This book was much better than the first one, "Summon your dragons".  It moved at a faster pace and focused more on a few main characters.

4	"Ill be honest, in Trail of Longing, I was not a fan of Alice. I felt bad for her, but I felt she allowed herself to wallow and caused undue hardship on her sister that wasn't necessary. It was refreshing to see in this book that she recognized that in herself and didn't like it, and worked hard the rest of the time. She definitely came into her own. And boy did she do it in a spectacular fashion. I thought she was going to burn the barn down. THIS woman knows what she wants and goes for it! Jarvis is a good man. He is helpful and he is always seeking the best possible solution. And he has patience. Which is a good thing. I really enjoyed the ease that he brings to Alice. And I really enjoy that she brings the sense of pride in Jarvis.\n\nMs. Farmer still doesnt disappoint in this continuation of her Hot on the Trail series. Were tying several books together by the end of this one. She says theres more to come, and I trust that theyll be just as funny and full of life as these first books have been.

4	"I just finished the Kindle edition of Peculiar Missouri. I have to say it reminded me of a Dean Koontz story in the feelings it invoked in me. I was rooting for the good guys but not totally sure who all was a good guy. You knew that certain characters like Kelly and Spenser were going to survive and that they would most likely end up together. However, I was not sure if Rachel would be whole again or not make it. I liked that we didn't know everything about Gordon's mission or even if he was really a good guy or a bad guy. I will certainly look for more novels by this author."
3	"i gave it a three star because i liked the fractured world background. i only gave it a 3 because sophie is kind of a twerp.  she's supposed to be a highly trained mage, but what she mainly does is hit things. in fact its like 95% of what she does  maybe even 99%.  pretty dumb."
4	'It is a totally amazing look into all 12 signs simply amazing'
3	'I was a little disappointed in this book after reading the first in this series.  It was a bit lackluster.  Although the plot was good, the chemistry between the two main characters didn\'t sizzle after their initial encounter at the ball where they met.  I got the impression the hero was less than impressive romantically.  Natasha was strong until her parents became involved, at which time she appeared to cave!  This doesn\'t speak to a strong personality, as most "strong" young females would certainly have stood up for themselves and rebelled......she did not.  There is no spark or passion in the writing here.  I wouldn\'t recommend it as it borders on boring reading.'
3	"I like it when I go into a book thinking Im getting one thing, and I get something totally different. This happened when I began reading Welcome Home. I thought it was going to be a haunted house story.\n\nThe story is haunting but there are no actual ghosts. Whats there is something shadowing John Lester. Its like when you see something out of the corner of your eye and when you turn to look, nothing is there. But this isn't visual so much as its memories. They haunt his sleep, staying just out of reach of recall.\n\nWhile this didn't really scare me, it did surprise me and thats always a good thing.\n\nA good story for a rainy day."
4	'I enjoyed it for the fact that it was a short read. I have always been interested in self help books'
4	'Excellent realistic characters, hope to continue the buildup, dive and explore into characters and their feelings and emotions with interesting frisky situations.'
4	'This book answers about every question or concern one who wants to self- publish needs to know...at least in the initial stage of deciding whether to try it or not.'
3	'I did like this short book, kinda reminded me of my Grandma right before she died. This story has to be hard for people who have been through it with their loved ones.\n\nI received this book in exchange for an honest review.'
3	"The potential for a really good book was there.  The storyline was intriguing.  The characters had the potential to be really interesting but could have been more deeply developed. Another comment is that the book's flow was not the smoothest.  I am known to finish a book once I start it and have rarely put one down.  But I wonder if all readers will feel that way with CoverBoys & Curses."
1	'Cannot read properly because of poor scan.'
4	"Is what I might have titled this book as, for 'Siblings' was only a small (minute, really) part of this story. A bit lengthy at times (perhaps my impatience at trying to figure out where said story was heading), yet I was invested enough in the characters to finish & find out where the story led. I'm glad I did. Katherine L. Smyth created a lovely tale, albeit the protagonist (Ash) seemed a bit clueless about the ladies he claimed to care so much for (at times where I was wanting to smack some sense into his oblivious head); yet a lovely tale nonetheless.\nI give this 3+3/4 stars - happy ending was a nice touch."
1	'So bad it has been expunged.  Sexual abuse of a developmentally delayed woman is abhorrent.  There are interesting mnage a trois/ a quatre  stories, there are predictable mnage etc., and then there is pornography.'
4	'nice surprise good characters great story building keeps your interest from beginning to end. Good flow.,quick read but enjoyable. Nice surprises. Good characters. Worth the read. Hope see more from this author.'
3	"3.5 Stars for me.  I really enjoyed this realistic story of a second chance romance. L.E. did a great job of painting Cassie and Grady as realistic people who have been through what a lot of young married couples go through, challenges that seem insurmountable and lead to the destruction of their marriage.\n\nGrady was fantastic!  I loved the way he pursued Cassie when they were teenagers, and had enough confidence to win her over even though he was a year behind her in high school.  Cassie has had a really rough life, with an alcoholic father and a mother who devotes all her time to covering for her father.  They married and had a child very young, while still in college, and then had another child very quickly, and this combination of events puts incredible strain on their marriage.  Grady doesn't handle the pressure and stress well and turns to drinking instead of the strength of his family, which pushes Cassie over the edge and she divorces him.\n\nFast forward 11 years and a family tragedy brings these two back into each other's lives, having had little to no contact at all over the previous years.  L.E. does a great job of leading the reader through Grady and Cassie's journey of reconnecting and rediscovering their feelings for one another.\n\nI loved the use of flashbacks to give the reader the background story on what events occurred in these character' lives and ultimately how they ended up divorced.  The present day chapters are told in alternating POV which gives us good insight into how Cassie and Grady are feeling.  I really enjoy getting into the male character's head, because as a female, I know how a woman thinks but I really want to know what kind of thoughts go through a man's head.\n\nAs much as I loved Grady and how hard he tried to win Cassie back, I got annoyed with Cassie and wanted to smack her upside her head on several occasions.  I completely understand what L.E. is trying to convey to the reader about the type of upbringing Cassie had, but she seriously ran way too many times and after a while I wanted to tell Grady to just give it up.  Even when they were married the first time, Cassie rushed into divorce before really having any kind of constructive conversation with Grady about his behavior and lack of support in the family unit.\n\nThe story flowed smoothly and I didn't feel that it dragged too much, but the reason I didn't give it more stars is because Cassie was way too frustrating for me personally, and needed to get out of her own headspace way more quickly than she did in the story.  Another negative for me were the spelling and sentence errors in the book.  It needed a little better editing or proofreading which would have caught the obvious errors.\n\nOverall I really enjoyed the story and I will be on the lookout for the next book in the series which revolves around Renee, who was married to Grady's brother.  That story sounds like it will be very interesting!"
4	"Having just visited Savannah, I enjoyed this mystery set in the Holy City.  The characters were interesting and the plot involving a missing woman and WHAT SHE MAY HAVE DISCOVERED will keep you involved, although I found the denouement somewhat abrupt. There is suspense leavened by the verbal gymnastics of the 'hero,' Ray Fontaine.  I even learned some interesting history from this book.  I look forward to the further adventures of this Savannah sleuth."
4	'I fell in love with the first book and everyone since just makes that love grow. Fabulous characters and fast paced plots that get you hooked.'
4	"This one was a surprise.  It was a quick read and has a plausible plot, if a bit cliched.  But I have to say I really enjoyed the story and the interaction of Ella and Brady.\n\nI think it's always nice when the sparks fly for the right reasons and not because the Hero's ego is so large he thinks everyone should worship at his ROCKER image.  I loved Ella and her effect the the big guy.\n\nIf you're looking for a light and wonderful cozy afternoon read you just found it.  Enjoy"
3	"A quick, easy to read and well written heated novella that'll get you lusting after your very own cowboy. Ended a bit fast there but still an enjoyable, bite sized read to inhale in an evening.\n\n*warning. May be triggering for abuse victims"

4	'I found this to be an inspirational and unique way to anticipate and celebrate the Christmas season.\n\nTo be honest, I usually dread this time of year, mainly because of the shortening daylight hours. Finances usually make Christmas a dreaded time for me, as well. Add in the fact that one of my children has a December birthday, and mine is at the beginning of the new year.\n\nThis year, though, I am actually anticipating reading The Most Wonderful Time of the Year with my children through the month of December, and trying out some of the suggestions with them. Be sure to check it out.'
2	"The typos in this book were unbelievable. Was it not edited at all?  They were too numerous to count and were so bad in places that you couldn't tell what the author was trying to say.

1	'I am not a fast reader, and I\'m pretty sure I finished this "book" in about 30 minutes. You might as well read about an alkaline diet from Rush Limbaugh. Meaning, this is just an over glorified letter to the editor -- full of opinion, not fact. This "book" which may as well be called an article has no fact and no sources. Sure some of the general points are vaguely correct, but the important part? The sources of food necessary to eat an alkaline diet? It\'s a short list of about 20-30 foods with no scale of alkalinity/acidity AND I might add this "book" tells you that you can eat chicken and eggs on the alkaline diet, which in fact you should not. It also tells you to avoid starchy vegetables like green beans, which is also untrue. I think it\'s pretty ridiculous that the author mentions Dr. Robert O. Young\'s book "The pH Miracle for Weight Loss" and he obviously hasn\'t read the book. I am currently reading said book by Dr. Young and it is full of scientific facts and studies and citations. Dr. Young rates foods on a scale from the best, most alkaline, to the worst, most acidic foods. It\'s a book I\'m going to invest my money in, as I currently have it checked out from the library. If you want something solid, do not waste your time with this pamphlet.\nLucky for me, I borrowed this with my Amazon prime account, so it didn\'t cost me anything extra, but now I have to wait until next month to borrow a real book.'

4	"Ainsley McLeon is an heiress on the run from her scheming Uncle when her truck crashes in frozen Montana. After being rescued by the local police Ainsley realises she needs to raise $2,000 to get her truck back on the road and get as far away from her Uncle as possible. Without access to her bank account Ainsley is forced into getting a waitress job in the local bar to raise the money she desperately needs.\n\nAt first glance Ainsley pegs bar owner Luc as a giant bear of a man who's more than just a little bit gruff and grumpy. As the story unfolds Ainsley soon realises that her instincts were pretty much spot on because gruff but oh so very gorgeous Luc is actually a bear shifter living in a town full of shifters.\n\nLuc who lost his wife and son in an accident is initially unwilling to get involved with another woman, Ainsley is exactly the kind of complication he doesn't want in his life but of course his protective bear instincts soon come out when he realises Ainsley needs his help.\n\nI did enjoy this opposite attracts shifter romance, it was impossible not to love Ainsley who is naturally charming and funny despite being an heiress. I loved that Ainsley when finding out her new employer is a bear shifter did what any normal woman does in times of crisis- stuff herself full of chocolate brownies! I did however find myself tuning out a couple of times in the second half of the book as the mystery ramped up, I think I would have happier if the story concentrated more on the main characters relationship which at times seemed a bit rushed. Overall, Lions, Tiger, and Sexy Bears Oh My! was a fun light little read."
3	'Meh - Cain could, and did, write much better books.'
4	"Kilt Trip is my first book by L.L. Muir, but won't be my last.  Ms. Muir has delivered a well-written book and populated it with fantastic characters.  Bridget, Mallory and Vivianne set off dressed as men on a quest in Scotland.  Rory's grandfather has passed away and he feels he must help the three women.  Rory and Bridget's story is loaded with drama, humor, action, suspense and spice.  I enjoyed reading Kilt Trip and look forward to reading more from L.L. Muir in the future.  Kilt Trip is book 1 of the Scavenger Hunting Series but can be read as a standalone.  This is a complete book, not a cliff-hanger.\n\nI voluntarily read a complimentary copy of this book.  All thoughts and opinions are my own."
4	'While the story has been told a number of ways over time. This was a very good example. Yes Ms Harper still shows some trouble with grammatical errors, but a delightful story no less. I thoroughly enjoyed this. Five stars for an excellent story, I give it a four star review for having so many errors.'
4	"Devolution by A.K. Robinson is a chilling tale of family engaged in a battle for the life of one of their own against a sadistic perp who will stop at nothing to satisfy his own desires.  Marco is just a troubled teen who lives in abject fear for his life and sanity through no fault of his own. Flynn, a soulless psychopath who had Marco in his clutches once and still considers the hapless boy his possession to enjoy in ways that will haunt you and propel you easily from one chapter to the next.\n\nFrom page one I was grabbed by how smoothly the writer told us Marco's story with unexpected shock, compassion and refreshing humor just at the right time. I found myself laughing at sudden twists at the darkest moments.  I felt sorry for Marco, and his family all of whom are dealing with their own family dysfunction. United they try to help Marco survive his own demons, his unstable sanity, epilepsy, and worst of all, Flynn's ceaseless drive to capture Marco again for his deviant pleasure.  I clung to a thread of hope Marco would eventually find his own before he found himself at the mercy of Flynn again.  Marco just wants a normal life.  I shiver for him during the bad times and pray for him during the bad.  I hope to enjoy another excellent roller coaster ride from this author again."
4	"Contains some spoilers!!!!\n\nI'm a fan of Lynn Cooper and this was way different than what she normally does.  This is a very dark tale.  It doesn't necessarily have a HEA.  Maybe not even a HFN.  Its a weird situation and if you read it you'd understand what I mean by thats.  I will say this is a dark romance book and not for the faint of heart because it included kidnapping and holding a woman captive and some abuse.  We meet Amara who is a young woman who's had a sheltered life and religious one at that including still being a virgin.  She was abandoned by her hippie parents and left to the care of her Grandmother who raised her to be a Godly woman.  Well, after she passes it doesn't take and Amara goes out on her own and ends up at Myrtle Beach.  She is alone and gets her wallet taken and after almost collapsing of heat exhaustion she is found by a seemingly nice guy Colt.  However, she comes to find out not everything is as it seems and nor is everyone.  He drugs her and kidnaps her and puts her in a cell in the basement of his home in the mountains.  When she wakes that's where her nightmare begins or so she thinks.  She is confronted by a man who looks exactly like Colt but is way darker and meaner.  His name is Slade and they are twins.  Light and dark and good and evil.  She can't help but be afraid of Slade but is also intrigued by him.  He's a dominant and he's not gentle or nice pretty much brutal.  When I was reading this it was little things and I discovered that early on that Slade is both Colt and Slade not 2 people.  So we got split personality going on.  Amara doesn't find this out until she is able to escape but is found by a sheriff and told of Colt and Slade and indeed there WAS a Colt but he was killed recently and Slade didn't handle it well.  Had a psychotic break because they were twins and inseparable.  I felt a lot of pity for him.  Slade forced her to choose between Colt and himself because the other person would have to go.  Yeah its a crazy kind of deal and Amara knows that if she chooses Colt it would end Slade and be so much worse.  So, she chooses Slade but he doesn't take it well because he doesn't wanna let go of his brother.  He eventually accepts it and accepts her as his.  Now that's pretty much where it ended after they did the deed which her virginity was taken.  Although he is known for his brutality and being ungentle...he really was pretty nice about taking her that first time.  I was impressed.  Anyways, although this was way different than her normal stuff I did like it.  It was a very interesting story and turn of events.  I wish it were longer though so at least we knew we had a HEA but guess not."

4	"Please note this review may contain spoilers.\n\nQuinn spent two years trapped in a very abusive marriage while being cut-off from the world.  Knowing that one day she was going to end up dead at Traviss hands, she plots and executes her escape.  Spending a year on the run living in womens shelters, she finally makes her way to her fathers Marine buddy, Mack.  No questions asked, he gives her a secretary/receptionist job at his MMA training facility.  Surrounding herself with big men who fight each other for a living was probably not her smartest move, but in the end the job helps her to heal, showing her that not all men are abusive or are out to harm women.\n\nShe meets Rick on her first day and her attraction to him is alarming.  Rick is also surprised with his attraction to her.  Being ordered to leave her alone because of his manwhoring ways, Rick knows thats one order hell never be able to follow.  Despite everything thats happened to her, Quinn is more than ready to move on.  She will not let Travis dictate her future or live in fear of all men.  But she comes with some serious baggage that she needs to get rid of before she can consider the idea of a relationship with another man.  And Travis is determined to get Quinn back and will stop at nothing to make sure it happens.\n\nIve not read many books where abuse is prevalent and I can imagine its a very hard topic to write about.  Having never been a victim of spousal abuse, what Im about to say could be completely wrong, but I didn't understand how Quinn was able to give herself to Rick so quickly.  While she held back from him emotionally, she very quickly gave him her body.  After what Travis did to her, I would assume that an abused woman would really want to take things slow.  Other than that, I think the story could have used a bit more time just to tidy up a few things.  Nothing major, but I found a few things that I thought were odd or that didn't make sense: If Quinn had access to this, why didn't she do that?; Why didn't anyone ever question that person after that happened?; Why didn't anyone at Sanctum investigate her past; and Why didn't anyone ever come to question Quinn when Travis was found?  Like I said, these aren't major issues, but I think if most of these little questions had been answered, I probably would have given this book 5 Hearts.\n\nOverall I thought this serial novella was pretty good.  The writing style was easy to read and I found I was able to read all three novellas quickly as the story held my attention and had me wanting to know what was going to happen next.  I liked that Rick helped Quinn to become the strong woman she wanted to be, while she gave him a reason to show a softer side of himself.\n\nPlease note, Quinn suffers some horrific abuse at the hands of her husband and her flashbacks and interactions with Travis were disturbing to read.  I strongly recommend that anyone who has suffered domestic abuse to take caution if they decide to read this series."
4	"Haven't used much yet."
3	"I loved the storyline, it was quite complex, and the characters were brought in in good time, all were interesting and well developed for the side characters.  However I kept feeling that I never got to know the main characters.  Patrick claimed at one point that he knew Sophie was pure of heart, but I never felt like we got to know her. And for someone who has been pulled to? bound to? In love with? this other person, he never really explains the depth of his feelings. And Sophie, who was so in love with Patrick, yet kept believing over and over that he didn't love her and just wanted to use her and kill her. And again with the prophecy, she believes in it, she doesn't believe in it.  She seemed to truly miss Vincent and all the time he would spend reading books, yet it seemed according to the story that she was only in the underground house spending any amount of time with Vincent maybe 4 times? Unless there was more going on than we were privy to. I really did enjoy the story, I just felt like there was some depth missing in the main characters.  And don't get me wrong, I'm not claiming that I could do better, but this is, after all, a critique."
4	"Wyatt the Heartbreaker has been caught with his pants down, literally. And typically, he wouldn't care. He has been upfront with every chick he's been with, but they don't seem to get it, though they claim they understand that there interlude is nothing but a thirst quencher in the beginning.\n\nI quickly began to relate to the characters. I liked Nellie and felt her pain throughout the book, which was an emotional ride. I liked how the author emphasizes the importance of family by drawing pictures with words. I did not want to put this book down. This read is definitely for mature audiences, but the adult content was not off putting at all. Wyatt was not overly domineering and so alpha that no one could breathe around him, but quite the contrary. I enjoyed Wyatt's wooing and his brothers' bond with him and the rest of the family. You could clearly see that there is more to the story than just sexy scenes, which I appreciate.\n\nThis story flows well and is easy to get lost in.\n\nI look forward to future books in this series."

4	'I enjoyed reading " The Invention of Wings".  This is an interesting book. Not a great book. The characters are well written & are based on the lives of real people from Charleston, SC in the early 1800\'s. I recommend it especially if you enjoy history or have been or lived in Charleston, SC.'

3	"I read the book and enjoyed it, but.  I kind of like alternate history books to depart from actual history at some point where some event, that could have gone either way, changes. I can think of many things down through history that swung on lucky chance going one way when it could have easily gone another. There were several attempts on Hitlers life for instance that could have easily succeeded except for a lucky break. But, having said that, this book reinvents a whole lot of history to arrive at the conclusion the author wants. Some of the reviewers comments seem to think that the author researched the facts, but I'm afraid the he fudged the facts a lot to fit the plot.\n  Lets start with the strength of the British Navy versus the German Navy in 1940 (the time of Hitlers collapse).  The British with 15 Battleships and Heavy Cruisers, 7 Carriers, 62 Cruisers, 184 Destroyers, 60 Submarines and 45 Escort vessels dwarfed the German Navy except for U_Boats. In 1940 the Germans had a total of 54 U_Boats of which most were the small Type II boat. The Type VII, which would be the main boat throughout the balance of the war were just coming on line. The battle of the Mediterranean did not take place for over a year later where the U-Boats did significant damage to the British.  But, it should be mentioned that not a single German submarine survived to return to base. The British learned quickly and started to employ the convoy system to moving goods.  A method that, once perfected, destroyed the U-Boat fleet.\n  The idea that the USA was sitting on it's hands this entire time is not supported by the facts. Roosevelt was very supportive of the British and was doing every thing he could, some of questionable legality, to aid them. By 1940 America was already started on an program to build the weapons of war,  And no matter how you cut it, Germany and Japan put together could not begin to approach the industrial might of the United States once it was engaged.  Roosevelt would likely have accelerated actions he took very soon after the novels jump off point and instituted the Lend Lease Program and started providing American escorts for convoys to England.\n  The Germans had no long range fighters or bombers. The air arm was built around the lightning war concept of close air support and to spearhead the panzers thrust into the battle field. They had no way to bomb any further into England than the southern southeastern part. They could not cripple the British war effort with their limited range. The best they could do was to defeat the RAF in (I Think it was called) Area 11. They could not reach RAF manufacturing facilities out of that area nor attack airfields and other essential installations. In June of 1940 there were something like 310 Spitfires in the RAF, but they had got over their early problems by that time and soon were producing over 600 Spites a month. The Germans would never have got air superiority over the Channel and England. The English on the other were developing long range bombers and, after a learning experience did rain bombs over German occupied territory.\n  The jet aircraft being developed by Germany would have provided a temporary superiority for air defense but, they were short ranged and not a real threat to have an effect in the battle of Britain. And it should be realized that both the British and Americans were developing Jet aircraft. The British, in fact, were very advanced in the science. It is likely that British intelligence would have got wind of any large movement of the Germans to start full scale Jet aircraft production and would have ramped up their own program.\n  The German Bund in the United States was never an influential organization. In fact there was a much larger Jewish influence that was vehemently opposed to the Nazis. Their rain of terror in occupied Poland and Russia would have horrified Americans and made the whole nation largely anti Nazi.\n  The book had to kill off Churchill of course on the assumption that the British would end up surrendering as a result without the leadership he provided.  Not likely.  They may have agreed to a peace pact giving Germany free reign in Europe, but they never would have surrendered. The more realistic outcome of such an event would mean that the Germans would not have to worry about England and could turn all their might against the Soviets.  Even then it's not clear that they could have won that war. Without long range bombers and fighters they could not have stopped war production of the Soviets, and the production the the awesome T34 tanks and other war material would have gone unchecked.  It should be noted that what the Soviets made might not have been pretty but, they could turn out material at a fantastic rate. I have serious doubts that the Germans could have beat the Soviets, at least without a long and bloody war.\n  The book is based on the presumption that everything the Germans did was successful and the Allies were a bunch of idiots that couldn't foresee what was going to happen and fell into the traps set for them.\n  In summary I found the book a pretty good read, in spite of the editorial mishaps, but not all that credible. Just too much departure from the way things really were in 1940."
4	"It was fun to return to the world of the Dark Ascension series, to learn more about Kit's backstory and see things from her perspective. This story could have been fleshed out more, though, in order to feel more distinctive rather than similar to a lot of other YA stuff out there. Also, the last few chapters felt rushed."

3	'This paperback or kindle book is aimed at the preschool market. There are some pretty black and white as well as color photographs. It explains the change of seasons through pictures and activities that a young child may enjoy. I think the book might have more impact if a child were included in the photographs. Young children will get the idea if the text is read aloud while pointing to the pictures, but the book has no real story line.'
4	"Oh my dragon shifters! I love, love, love this series and it just keeps getting better and better. I normally don't like a series where there are that many paranormal creatures thrown into the mix because I get all confused but to my surprise on this particular series I actually don't mind! The author knows how to craft her paranormal world and how to keep it straightforward and engaging.\nI read each story as they came out and I absolutely recommend them to anyone that likes PNR perfectly blended with a sense of adventure, passion, and urban fantasy."

2	"The main ingredient in this book is sex, sex held together by a brief story about a dragon temple and dragon statues which need sex to awaken. That's it really, not much else to say except that Camille is a virgin and she gives her virginity to a dragon statue, oh and the guy, this is a real guy as in flesh and blood, anyway the guy she likes confides that while he's been having sex with someone else he was actually picturing Camille's face, and Camille seems pleased by this!!!\nThis book's free and if you like loads of sex and aren't particularly bothered about much story then this could well be the book for you but I like sex to complement the story not replace it so it wasn't great for me."
4	"His Bear Hands by Callista Ball and Layla Nash is a fairly short read.  This would be a good choice for those with limited time for reading.  His Bear Hands is a well written paranormal shifter book.  Simon and Zoe's story is full of humor, action, suspense and sizzle.  The characters are lovable and fun.  I enjoyed this book and look forward to reading more from Callista Ball and Layla Nash in the future.  His Bear Hands is book 1 in the Bear Creek Grizzlies Series but can be read as a standalone.  This is a complete book, not a cliff-hanger."
2	'Just as I was becoming really enamored with Samantha Michaels\' cookbooks...this happened.  Probably better titled, "Just how Vegan are YOU?" This book does indeed give you vegan recipes, along with many uninspiring pictures. Some of the food looks almost gray and lifeless to me. The layout of the digital copy is choppy. It\'s nowhere near a good representation of most of the books by her I have read. She does a good job of continuing to keep number of ingredients per dish down to a manageable number, but I fear the sum total of the recipes lack... imagination. For instance, was it really necessary to put a recipe for country fried potatoes in this book? Or potato hash? Or just swapping the potatoes for sweet potatoes and presenting a nearly identical recipe as being something new because it included "sweet potatoes"? Let\'s not talk about the last section(s) of the book that are seemingly devoted to granola (stereotyping much?)  And then banana began to rear it\'s yellow head. I\'ve mentioned in other reviews I am personally allergic to banana and this ingredient seems to often be a staple for low fat, juice/blending or vegan recipes. I see it as a creative crutch. Yes, it\'s cheap. Yes, it\'s versatile. But if it permeates too many things even people not allergic will get really tired of the flavor really quick. Sad to say, I think there are better books out there.\n\nDisclaimer: I was given a free digital copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. I have not been compensated in any other way to give a better review. The opinions shared are mine and mine alone.'
1	"Anne was my hero growing up. She is a witty girl who could never quite manage to stay out of trouble. Aside from the fact that Anne [as many have mentioned already] is a red head, nothing else on the cover of this book would let me know that the book was set in the early 1900's. It is by all means misleading to what the story is about. If I were a young girl today and I saw this, I would believe it was another soppy teen romance. Then I would not have read it. Unless, this is someones sick joke of making the reader look beyond the cover of the book. I truly believe if LM Montgomery where alive to see this she would have fought it as well. Also, as a writer you gave me something to think about. I need to leave a greatly detailed list about how my books are to be represented when I leave this world behind."
4	'A nice ending to the trilogy. I think there will be more to come may be with the cousins stories but I think ending this the way it did without giving away any spoilers, was fitting.'
4	'Book is very informative about the most famous mobsters and how they rose to power, and how the fell.  Also, how people were very poor and what they had to endure to survive.'
4	'This was a great short story. I would have given it five stars if the story had been a longer story like the rest in this series. I still highly recommend reading it!'
4	'This was a pretty good book. The characters have grown and although it was a bit wordy, I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book.  It is a quick and entertaining read and keeps you guessing.'
4	'As a jr. high teacher I appreciated her wise and balanced advice about homework. The ideas are broken down into preschool, elementary, middle school, and high school sections. It has made me rethink the type of homework I assign and some of the reasons students refuse to do certain assignments. Practical, insightful, and (hooray) a quick read!'
4	'Good read, would read more of this author'
3	"The book was different, an erotic departure for this writer.  It's a good read if you take it for what it is.  It's not a classic, but this writer does a good job."
3	'This should have been $.99 for how short it is. Could have elaborated more or at least add better illustrations.'
4	'Great action.'
4	"I gave this book 4 stars because it wasn't typical of boy meets girl, fall in love, gets married. The hard part of this story is a woman accepting an abusive fiance, thinking he would stop if they married. Sorry not going to happen in my world."
4	'First, about this title. Be forewarned, unless you are interested in mythology and the origin of language/words, you will not enjoy this. "Atlantis and the Birth of Mankind" seems to be a piece of lengthy investigation, annotations of a lengthy research; in other words it reads like a series of footnotes.\n\nIf you have read Professor Santos\' book, "Atlantis: The Lost Continent Finally Found," you know that the writing style of that book is seemingly incomplete. And with the death of Prof. Santos, it seemed that a much-needed follow up volume (or a more thorough rewrite) would never happen. Thankfully, Frank Joseph Hoff (?) has stepped up, to present more of Dr. Santos\' labor of love: proof for the existence of a now-sunken Paradise in the region of the Java Sea, So here is where the loss of a perfect rating steps in for this piece, "Atlantis and the Birth of Mankind." Simply, the writing style poorly contains the multiple facets of evidence; evidence that easily stands on its own, were it not for the unnecessary repetition and poor English grammar. I do not blame Dr. Santos, a native Brazilian, so much as I do the individuals that rushed the publishing of such poorly edited research. For some readers, the lack of execution is enough of a reason to discredit the genuinely viable ideas that are being presented. If an open-minded reader can get beyond this nagging oversight, then you can hopefully expect to gain insight into the cultural amnesia promoted by mainstream historians.'
3	'Cute story.'
4	"It is unfortunate that this book hasn't had a final finish edit from a native English speaker. There are little errors throughout , so grammar Nazis should stay away.\n\n That being said, I felt that the authentic perspective made the book seem very real. I enjoyed characters names that I've never heard of and cultural references that helped to increase my perspective of India and its culture. It was like taking a literary vacation to India.\n\n Open your mind, and give this little gem a try! I'm glad I did!"
2	'I had a difficult time reading this. It has so many typographical errors I could not decide whether it was the fault of the author, where editors, or Amazon. It would have had three rating if these were not so distracting.'
4	'Good ideas will incorporate in life for sure. Would share with my friends . Will read again to keep practicing'
4	"The book is okay on Airbnb it's kind of short and not the best book on the subject 4 stars"
4	'I am retired militrary and know a little about the subject..  Good book those interested in the modern militraries.  I enjoyed he book.'
3	'This is a fascinating novel, just different enough to stand up against any kind of thriller being written today. I have always felt that the next dimension to be explored is the inner dimension, and Richard Alan has a unique take on the possibilities there, while still giving us plenty of the good, "old-fashioned" excitement of the "heart in the throat" chase.\n\nI enjoyed the plot and the characters of "The Rabbit Hole" enormously. I would give the novel five stars, but I have subtracted two over editing issues. Yes, there are regular little errors scattered throughout the entire book - a minor distraction. The three star rating, however, isn\'t because of these. Mr. Alan has committed a whopper of a misspelling, repeating it with great frequency throughout much of the book. He writes extensively about music performance (primarily a jazz trio that is part of the plot), and frequently dwells on the sound of the bass (presumably a string or stand-up bass). Only he spells the word "base"! It\'s such a common word that I have never seen it misspelled before. So I was challenged every time I saw it to get the image of a baseball diamond out of my mind, then get the image of a platform for something out, then remember that this was his secret code for a musical instrument. It was exhausting! I wanted to shout, "JUST GOOGLE IT! OR ASK THE FIRST PERSON YOU SEE ON THE STREET HOW TO SPELL IT!" I should also add that there is no excuse not to give your novel a basic professional editing job. I know a lot of self-publishing authors don\'t, but there is still no excuse.'
3	"I think that the book moved along just a little to fast, and while I enjoyed the book,  exaggerating some details would benefit the story.  I also think there should be a little more to the ending.  I also thought some of the speaking ( such as Zeus to our unicorn, and some other spots)  we're just a little awkward.  I still majorly enjoyed this book"
3	'Most of this information could be found with a very simple Google search. Still is still useful little guide for beginners.'
2	'I\'m not fond of this kind of alpha male where the guy is arrogant and full of himself, refusing to take no for an answer. I just didn\'t like the fact that he was pushy, demanding, and didn\'t show any respect for Jess\'s wishes in the beginning. This kind of male lead seems to be the current trend in New Adult romance fiction, but in real life if I were to meet a man who tried to dictate to me and TOLD me I\'d be having lunch with him instead of ASKING... then disregarded the fact that I declined and already had other plans, and kept insisting, sending reminder texts and cornering me in my office... You know what? I would freak out and tell him to get lost. That\'s crazy stalker behavior. It\'s not hot.\n\nThe trope here is "the player who gets brought down by that one special girl". But the problem with this book is the same problem so many NA romances have: the plot relies heavily on physical attraction/chemistry/lust. From the first time they see each other, each thinks the other is sizzling hot and wants nothing more than to tear the other\'s clothes off and get horizontal. We are supposed to believe that this lust is so powerful that it has Max breaking the rule of a lifetime: "never get involved." And it IS lust, because we are given dual first-person POV and all Max keeps saying is how hard he is for Jess all the time and how he can\'t wait to get inside her again as soon as possible. Like, seriously. Something like that is not enough to induce a player to commit in real life. He supposedly moves from lust to more complicated feelings, but it\'s hard to see why, as we\'re never given any reason why Jess is so special. We\'re supposed to accept that she just is.\n\nAnd Jess... I also really hate it when authors put their female leads at the mercy of their hormones. "I want to resist him, but I can\'t -- he\'s just too delicious and just looking at him makes me wet! I can\'t help but respond to his advances even though I know this isn\'t a good idea! Poor me, my hormones have taken over and I\'ve lost my brain cells!" I don\'t know why female authors write heroines like this. It\'s insulting to women, and if any woman were to act like that in real life, she would be putting herself in danger.\n\nYeah, well, it\'s fiction, you\'ll say. Well, if Jess is surrendering to Max against her better judgment, how am I supposed to feel happy for her? There\'s that "it\'s not right" feeling floating in the background. I\'ll know that she\'s not totally comfortable with it, even if she enjoys out-of-this-world sex (which they always do). Sure, later Max might prove himself worthy. If he does, then she\'s super lucky.\n\nAnyway... Yeah, I didn\'t like Max in the beginning, I didn\'t like that he couldn\'t act like a normal human being and just ask Jess out instead of trying to arrogantly dictate to her. I liked Jess\'s feistiness but didn\'t like that her hormones constantly overruled her caution when she got into close proximity with Max. I also thought Stella\'s character was so BLINDINGLY OBVIOUS (why must there always be a scheming b***h who wants to sink her claws into the hero? And why is the hero always oblivious?!?). Finally, I hated the cliffhanger. I kinda want to know what happens next, but I don\'t know if my curiosity is strong enough to prompt me to pay for the next two books. It\'s not as if the writing was fantastic or bowled me over. It\'s a fairly typical NA romance.'
2	"Ending was too abrupt.  Like the author ran out of time or energy to build to a finish and just wanted to get it over with. Up til then, it was a decent read. Call me a prude, but I the swearing was superfluous. I know everyone does it, but it doesn't make the book better."
1	"Just awful!!!! I hated it but then again i did enjoy the actual 50 shades books. Oh well I guess that's what I get"
4	"I just got this book, it's very inspirational and can't wait to get back to it. I really like the way in which you explaine the many portions of our human potential. My thought is that with practise we also can interact with the energy you talk in the book.\nthanks\nDaniel Z."
4	"Enjoyed this book as much as the first. Looking forward to the next. Took a chance on an unknown author to me. Well worth it. Can't think of anything more important than art,music and literature. Libraries are one of mankind's greatest gifts. We have wonderful technologies, but books are like friends,meant to be treasured."
4	'I loved the other two books in this series and I was very excited to read Adam, but I have to say that although Iiked the book, it took me until the end of the book to even start to like Mia and to tell you the truth had they split up I would have been fine to see her go.'
3	'The story line is very interesting and exciting but, I think it had to much repeat of the first book.  It should have continued and expanded the story line. Instead it was over 3/4 of repeat of the  first book of the series. Not cool !! Just a waist of time!'
1	'Please Edit. Simplistic storyline, one dimensional characters set in a black and white world where military mentality and training are the hallmark of a moral decision. I doubt I was ever naive enough to believe that kind of thing.'
3	'Very short read. Nothing really new in it for me but it was a nice read. I was expecting more and was surprised when I reached the end - it seemed to stop too soon.'
4	'I really enjoyed this lovely book. Sharon Booth has written a charming, engaging novel with realistic and likeable characters and a female lead that you will really care about.\nEliza, despite her money, has all the same insecurities as other women, and she now finds herself at a crossroads in her life, but her kindness and warm personality, her genuineness, ensure that she soon settles in to Kearton Bay, and finds not only new friends, but also a possible new romance.\nThe author obviously cares deeply about her characters, and you will too. Its a warm, feel good read, that avoids the mawkishness and sentimentality of a lot of novels in the same genre. The settings are beautifully described and easy to picture and you will find yourself rooting for Eliza, and willing her to make the right decisions.\nPerfect for some chill out time.'
4	"This book was a page turner I couldn't put it down I really enjoyed all the surprising twists and turns it had I never say coming ."
4	'I can\'t remember ever reading a book that made me as nervous as this one did.  I couldn\'t stop looking at the percentage left and worrying if there was going to be a resolution and also my number one book need...an epilogue.  Phew, it was a close one, but the reader gets both.\n\n"You\'re the only one I want, Cara."\n\nOk, ladies I must introduce you to Ashton (Ash), the voice behind this book.  He has all my FBB (Favorite Book Boyfriend) traits: he can sing, he is hot, he is poetic, he cares for his family, he is romantic, and has some ink.  Since losing his dad right before he was to attend University of San Diego on a scholarship, he decided to stay and live at home to take care of his mom and two siblings.  He became the rock of the family; making sure that he was there for everyone.  Flash forward four years, and Ash seems to be barely existing, going from girl to girl, and not feeling ANYTHING.  That is, until he sees Cara in the library and knows that there is something about her.  She is unlike any girl that he has been with and at the same time seems to be unfazed by him.  Once they get together, you see that Ash completely brought out the real Cara; she finally sheds the "girl with the large glasses" persona that she hid behind.  She also brought out a different side of Ash, she was able to show Ash that it was ok to break down sometimes, and he didn\'t need to be strong all the time.  In turn, she also showed him that she was there for him.  Of course no book is complete without some angst that pulls the couple apart.  I have to say that I was super mad at Ash for a few pages...but boy, he really redeemed himself.  Like I said ladies, you will fall in love with him!\n\n"It\'s ok, Ash." she whispers.  "You can fall now...I\'ll be here to catch you."\n\nI am the first person to admit that I am not the biggest fan of insta-love but in Lovely, it totally worked for me.  I don\'t know if it\'s because the book was told in Ashton\'s POV or if I was just blinded by him, but it worked.  I am really glad that we got an epilogue but I wish we got some closure on a few other things.\n\n"I want to make you smile every day for the rest of your life...I love you Cara."\n\nIf you are looking for a sexy-hot and bittersweet read, then look no further!'
4	"Wow, I say sometimes that I don't know where to start on a review, and always mean it, but this one more so than others.\n\nI considered making this installment in the authors series a DNF (Did Not Finish) because I was so angry when I was reading it that I wanted to jump into the pages of the book and grab the MC, Ashton, and slap his stupid self until he smartened the hell up! And ask anyone, Im not even a violent person.\n\nBut no, Ashton didn't smarten up. After the events when we last met him and Reese, in the second installment of this series, Ravel, I thought that Ash had grown up and would act responsibly. But no, not Ash.  Even though he lives in a world where humans are s*x slaves, food, the prey in hunts, and can be killed in the street because any member of any of the supernatural species feels like it, he still thinks it is fine to go out for a walkjust because it is a sunny dayobviously his werewolf lover and protector, Reese, doesnt know better than him.\n\nIm just going to say itI despised Ash in this one. What kind of person does it make me that I read the brutal group non-consensual s*x scene and my first thought was thereare you happy now stupid? Then of course I felt bad about even thinking those thoughts.\n\nBad Ms. Phoenix for making me think evil thoughts.\n\nThis is a very violent installment in a violent series. It should not be read as a standalone. The characters have been building through the series, and the entire story seems to be building towards some upcoming event.\n\nIn conclusion, this one was much more graphically violent than the previous installments. They were also graphically violent, but I believe each one is getting just a little more over the top in sadism. Im not sure I personally even liked this book, but Im going to rate it a 4.0, which means Im recommending it.  Pay attention thoughIm only recommending it for a very limited market. If you are a fan of the very, very dark, with torture, non-consensual s*x, murder, and graphic violence, it would be for you. Otherwise, heed the authors warning and my personal warning and move along.\n\nAs for me? Im off to lick my wounds from this one. Can anyone say light and fluffy? Thats what my next read has to be, so that I can get this one out of my mind!\n\nSeriouslygreat job Ms. Phoenix. You rattled me a little on this one."
4	"What an awesome couple. Quinn and Vanessa. Quinn is a shifter, whose wanted Vanessa forever.  Vanessa is a human and is totally clueless to all of Quinn's subtle advances. On a dare from a snobby  coworker she kisses Quinn. Quinn is in heaven, but realizes Vanessa is drunk out of her reasonable senses. The kiss was recorded and uploaded to a social media site, now everyone knowns about the Kiss, except Vanessa because she remembers, not much... Now .Quinn has a plan to get his love in his life and his bed.\nSweet romantic with a touch of clueless!\nThis was gifted to me in exchange for an honest review."
4	'Good explanation of reluctant bride to unknown groom.  Influence of mother excellent but father was cruel, interested only in own desires and ending provided no explanation for conclusion of his fate.'
4	"This book was a very good read.  I love it when you have a love story that features BBBW since I  am one.  Antoinette and Aaron make a good couple and I am glad they did not rush into anything.  You know u will always have haters wherever u go and I was shocked but not surprised that Aaron was shot at the end. This ending left me hanging and I can't wait for part 2.  Don't keep us hanging to long."
4	'I like the Percy Jackson and the Kane Chronicles so combining them into their own mini series was the best'
4	"I enjoyed this first book by Bethany Averie. It was silly and sweet, romantic and readable. The playfulness between Sasha & Monroe is something you don't often see in romances. The three realms made for an interesting and clever fairy-tale world. I thought that some of the conflict was resolved too easily and neatly, but overall a good beach read!"
4	'I throughly enjoyed this book.  A refreshing read about a seminary student searching to quantify his  calling and and his mission durning his last semester of school.  The reader is given an insight into his thoughts and we can be witness to his ultimate decision.\nIf you like Christian fiction, I think you will enjoy this book.'
4	"I waited a long time to get this story and I was so not disappointed.. move over Matt and your pancakes because Trey and his bacon have made a statement!  I have loved every book in this series and this one is no different.  I was so happy when I heard that Gabbie was writing Trey a story because even though we got to see parts of his life in the first 3 books it just wasn't enough.  The dynamics of this book will make you want so much more when it ends, but I knew that would happen because it's Gabbie S. Duran for peets sake she could write me a phone book and I am sure i would be just as enthralled in it as i have been captivated by all of her books.  Thanks for Trey's story and I can't wait to see what else you have in store for us in the near future!  4 Fantastic Stars!"
3	'It was difficult to tell where the plot (story) was going.  At times it seemed the characters were shallow. If there was a secondary plot it was not well integrated by the characters, Mycroft or Amelia.  Sherlock had a minor roll compared to the amount of words given to his character.'
4	'If you enjoy books about the Wild West that are fast paced with a lot of action then I highly recommend the reading of the Jess Williams series by Robert J.Thomas.'
4	'Very interesting read.  I recommend it if you want something different.'
4	"Am a big fan of series book.  Once I started could not put this book down.  An enjoyable read.  Can't wait for the next one."
4	'This is a really good series. I thoroughly enjoyed the writing, the plots and the characters. I think each story was wrapped up too quickly, but otherwise I would recommend highly. The stories are sweet, the relationships are mature, and the conflicts are honest. Very nice.'
4	"One of my favorites. I first found this book about a year ago. I started reading it and didn't stop until the book was over. I have read this like a hundred times and I still love it."
4	'The description of the lunch in a caf with smacking lips, slurping soup and popping food conjured up a picture of many pigs.'
4	"I really enjoy the story I only gave 4 stars though because of the typos and mistakes but story has me hooked can't wait for next one!"
4	"Unexpected Consequences by Jaye Cox\n4 stars\n\nGreat first book\nI love jumping into a book blind, not having read any blurb or anything, and thats exactly what I did with this book,and was hooked from the start\nI don't think most people will get the instantlove, but that was my hubby and me so I know its real and happens, if you've never experienced it you will never know what it feels like to just see someone meet them and thats it game over.\nI loved that Bell was young and and never met a guy she wanted to give herself to until Rayne, yes she seems like a goodie two shoes, but she really wants to break free of the hold her dad has over her, and live a little.\nAs the book progresses we see Bell blossom from a young girl into a woman, we also get to experience all her heartache and pain as she grows, plus like most young people she makes errors in judgement that could have serious consequences, for me Bell was a very believable character, I felt everyone of her highs , and even worse her lows, she emerges stronger.\nRayne on the other hand, is almost set on a course of self destruct, he is blinkered and almost blind to his end goal, he is also blind to how his actions affect others namely Bell, he thinks he knows what the best course of action is and acts accordingly, never once stopping to consider the consequences and as the story unfolds, he finds out just how costly those consequences can be.\nThere were so many times reading this book I wanted to slap a character, when I was frustrated with them for being so stupid, and other times it brought me to tears with the pain the characters were in.\nBeautiful story, of when you do fall in love at first sight there is so much you don't about each other and problems that causes, added to that there are lies and not so much lies but more information that cant be shared so is that really lying by omission, and once that trust has been broken can you ever truly get it back.\nBeautiful book beautifully written, so looking forward to more from this author"
2	'I liked it.  Guy was a trainwreck though. Oh if we could change every man..'
1	'I try to give everything a chance, but this was very difficult to read. The characters had no personality, the dialogue was choppy, the plot predictable. In addition, this was barely a short story, and had a cliffhanger ending.'
4	'The Spinster and Mr. Glover  Written by Karyn Gerrard\n\nThis was a tantalizing erotic novella. A spinster, Anne, decides to hire an escort for the night to have sex in her home. Her friends had told her she had done this and found it most gratifying.\n\nOn the evening Desmond, the escort, arrives Anne contemplates cancelling the rendezvous until she sees him.  They both feel a very strong connection immediately.  Anne is devastated to learn of Desmond horrible childhood but feels an unleashed attraction for him.  He, too,never connects with his clients but cannot disregard how drawn he is to her.\n\nThe ending was a bit too good to be true.  I was expecting a hoax of some sort but was glad I was wrong.'
4	'A bit of an imponderable for me here. I never really got an understanding of why Lily left in the first place.\n\nThat aside, the efforts by her deaf, adopted brother, Leon to track her down and either rescue and save or revenge her make for a compelling and brutal read. Leon learned to kill as a child in Nigeria, before coming to America. (Any similarities between his journey and that of an Eddie Murphy-esque African prince end now.)\n\nViolent, graphic, uncomfortable, disturbing and dark. I loved it. Not an easy read and those of a sensitive disposition may be better skimming at times, as Leon when he is unable to draw answers from witnesses with his pen and pad and lip-reading is just as adept with his fists, or feet or an item of cutlery.\n\nFrom a standing start, Leon soon picks up Lilys trail via a diner and then a strip joint controlled by some Russians. Breaking a few laws to get some answers, Leon comes to the attention of the cops and the Russian mob family that Lily has become involved with, albeit indirectly by her marriage. A video of Lily being raped and beaten by the Russians as her husband looks on, fuels his rage.\n\nA tad of a stretch totally buying the police complicity in allowing Leon to continue to pursue his vendetta in the face of evidence (or strong suspicion at least) linking him to murder and arson, but regardless to that, I read on compulsively.\n\nBent cops, straight cops, people trafficking, rape, murder, arson, strip clubs, burglary, safe-cracking, videos, underground prison ..death, destruction, violence, rescue, rage, family, loyalty, revenge. No regrets.\n\nYou never doubt the depth of Leons love for Lily. In the end we have some answers, but no happy ending.\n\nOverall  an extremely entertaining and satisfying ride, with an intriguing protagonist.\n\nI will look forward to seeing more from the author in the future.\n\n4 from 5\n\nHe has previously had a short story collection published  Losing Found Things and has another novel due out this year  Ren.\n\nThanks to the author and Kelsey McBride for my copy.'
4	'Love the book but his writing style is very lengthy and rambling. You have to have a really, really good attention span to follow along'
4	'Enjoyed the story and will look for more of her books. Cowboys make my heart flutter and Cale was exceptional.'
2	"This book has some good points. It is though, a message I have heard before. It reads like a lecture from a loving, but tough uncle who wants you to succeed in life. It could have benefited from a good proof reader, but this doesn't diminish the message Stefan has. I felt that the message could also have benefited many people by showing them how to lay out a plan of action. If,though, you are in need of a swift kick in the behind, this book provides that.\nI gave it only two stars because I feel this same topic has been done more thoroughly by others."
4	'All the stories in this book are enchanting. And they are such sweet, clean reads. A younger audience will eat them up, but as an adult, I still found enjoyment in reading them.\n\nBeware the naive protagonists. Drool over the dashing suitors. These stories are simply written. A lot of travels across kingdoms. The best thing is how all the novels are related and how the author pulls characters from earlier stories. It\'s just one happy reunion all the time!\n\nOne draw back. There was a hang up with a few phrases. Lips tilted or tipped a lot. I don\'t even know what tipping lips means. And people are "still," quite a bit, whether they are dead or are just standing motionless.\n\nReader rated for ages 14+ for mild sensuality and mild violence.'
1	"got to page 10 and quit. this is not fit for human consumption. So glad I didn't have to do a book report on it."
2	"I found this book completely unbelievable.  Not worth reading please don't wright anymore in this series. Save your money read something else"
4	'A little like terry pratchett with humans, goblins and elves and a rogue wizard.  Nice plot, good humour, characters were colourful'
4	'Very interesting concept, well executed.  I feel like it gave me true insight into the way a real "case officer" has to think, rather than the fiction, no matter how well written, by authors who have had no experience in the field.  I\'ll look forward to the next installment.'
4	'Great book to read. The either had some great points and ideas to increase the chance of a long distance relationship.'
4	'It started so slow I almost quit reading.\nEstablishing who was who, and why they mattered took a long time.\nBut once you understood the dynamics of the police department, the story made a lot of sense.\nThe plot actually has three or four levels, all going on together. On the surface its a murder investigation.\nBut the lead investigator has a very troubled past, so much so that the state has sent one of their investigators to keep an eye on him.\nThere was an "incident" in his past where an undercover operation went south, and a number of people were shot. So he\'s an albatross on the PD.\nThe second half got moving nicely, and although there were lots of flaky suspects, none were believed to have committed the crime.\n\nGreat story!'
1	'This book was a disappointment. It felt like the author took a short cut by writing the same story twice in a short book.'
3	'2.5/5 Maybe I missed the memo, but that was what, 50 pages at most? The storyline is solid, but the writing is a little trashy at times. I need much more to purchase the next book.'
2	'A very odd book. No clear beginning, middle or end as well as lack of clarity in the overall story. Was more like picking up a book and reading a random chapter. An odd little piece of reading.'
4	"It's a dare to change stories . I like for this the writer .\nWe are used to know the end of the classic stories and this keeps us alert to the end of reading."
4	'You could feel her emotional turmoil because of what she had done.  I would have liked it to go deeper with her emotional changes.'
4	'After I found this, downloaded it, read it, and liked it, I looked a bit more closely at the author, Anne Digby. Interestingly, she has taken up Enid Blyton\'s baton and written a number of books that continue Blyton\'s Naugtiest Girl series. She also has a series about a young girl at the Trebizon boarding school, which echoes Blyton\'s Malory Towers and St. Clare\'s school series. I thought this was interesting mainly because Blyton\'s Famous Five and Adventure books would have been the ones I would have compared this Jill Robinson series to even if there hadn\'t been such a strong connection.\n\n  Jill Robinson is sandwiched in the Robinson family between younger brother Tony and much older sister Sarah. Mom, Dad and Gran are the adults. They go on holidays and Jill and her siblings, or Jill and her best friend Lindy, have adventures and encounter and solve mysteries, in the face of menace! and danger!.\n\n  The books are smartly written but they have an old fashioned feel. The kids ride bicycles around. They stop for tea. They are mannerly and polite, but they are like terriers once they get their teeth into a mystery. And get this - Jill and Tony and Sarah like each other, and admire each other, and often cooperate or talk through their differences. In this volume Tony is in trouble with Dad because he is being secretive about some "bad boy" he has befriended. Jill tries to help Tony, believes his explanation of what\'s going on, and even runs interference for him with Mom and Dad. No moaning or kvetching. Not once did anyone roll their eyes; although once Jill raised her eyebrows at Sarah, who raised her eyebrows back, behind Mom\'s back.\n\n  This not dopey stuff. Dialogue is sharp. The kids are smart. The adults are more rounded out than usual. The stories don\'t plod. Scenes are efficiently set and the plot moves along nicely. It\'s just not frantic or sketchy, and it\'s all calmly and carefully crafted.\n\n  So, there\'s some excitement, there\'s a mystery, there\'s some action, there\'s a lot of quick thinking, and there is charm and personality to burn. A bit slow at times? I guess so. But that\'s a small price to pay for such engaging characters, good writing, good humor and satisfying craftsmanship. A very happy find for your middle grade or possibly younger reader.\n\n  Please note that I found this book while browsing Amazon Kindle freebies. I have no connection at all to the author or the publisher of this book.'
1	'Waste of time'
4	'I really enjoyed this book.  I think I knew from the beginning how it would end, but still a nice read.'
4	"I was already a fan of Paul Levine, but had not read the other two authors previously. I was very pleasantly surprised to get three enjoyable thrillers in one package. I'd definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good thriller."
4	"But I still liked it. It's not an on the edge of your seat kind of book. Really a one hour standard crime drama. I'm going to read the next book."
3	'Again great visualizations like the first two books and lots of twists and turns, and answers to questions.  But it needed more, it was too short.'
4	'I love the Kate on vacation series.  It is more like a working vacation though.  Kate and Skip return to Texas to his hometown for a high school reunion.  Kate has never visited his family so all of this is new to her,  Including the fact that one of the high school alumni was a  bully back in the day and is trying to keep up his image.  Unfortunately, he meets an untimely death and Skip and several others are suspects.'
4	'Nothing like cuddling up with a Hot alpha bear!!!  I thoroughly enjoyed this story and looking forward to the next book in this series.  I have never read anything by this author before, but Novalee Swan has my attention now!!  A good read!!!!!'
1	"This is not the Anthony Briggs translation as advertised. It's freem but if you're looking for the Briggs translation this isn't it."
1	'It is astonishing that this book has so many favourable reviews.  Considering this is a self-published book, I can only say that the author has a lot of friends willing to weigh in their support of what is a bland, un-original and inauthentic "story".\n\nI found this book completely atrocious, and am only confessing to have read it (or at least, tried to read it) because there is very little unbiased reviews for this book. I\'m a huge chick-lit fan with a low threshold for the believable, but this book is so pathetic.\n\nI would advise the author, next time she chooses to use a major city as a title, to have stepped foot in that said city before embarking on writing about it.  The amount of inaccurate British descriptions disgust me - and I\'m not even British! Who in their right mind would think Prince William speaks Cockney?! Anyone can take general London stereotypes to throw in a book, but it\'s just not acceptable.\n\nThere is much, much better reading out there, even in a traditional low-expectation genre like this.  Please don\'t waste your money based on these ridiculous, positive reviews! I wish Amazon would allow a 0-star rating, because that\'s what this story deserves.'
4	"This book isn't great literature.  It will never win any prestigious awards.  It is short and quick and sexy and witty and has a dog.  Of the paranormal type, but still it has a dog.  Who is much loved by not one but two people.  And how their desire to ensure the dog is happy helps them find happiness.  Sweet and fun, a book I am glad I picked up as it fit the bill for what I needed - a pleasant time filler."
4	"Wonderful story, I didn't want to put it down. Editing could have been better, and if it was it would receive 5 stars."
2	"Ugh. I hate giving any book 2 stars cause who am I to say what is good but I just couldn't with this book.....I just couldn't :( I hated Lana from the beginning and it never got better through out the book. I didn't really like the vengeful nature she exhibited in the book even though I could understand why she was distrustful of him. I didn't really understand the Jarek character either.....wasn't much substance to him. I did enjoy the secondary characters as they gave a bit of comic relief but it just wasn't enough for me.\n\nI received a copy from Netgalley, in exchange for an honest review."
2	"I honestly have no clue wth is goin on... I haven't even gotten through part 2 yet and I'm scratching my head with the many different directions the story is going in. 1st Kenji would watch Brook'lyn sleep when she was so high that she never knew he was there and she would pass out when she smoked to much... Then keep reading and Brooklyn says that she doesn't smoke only when her friend around... How sway how lol... I can't even get through the book sorry to say n I was actually waiting for part 2"
4	'good story, easy to follow, truly believable to the point of wondering what to do in this same situation.cant wait to get ingo next book.'
4	'Well written. Would be wonderful if every one could live such simple honest lives.  Slowing down to enjoy what God provides would help everyone.'
4	'Loved it!'
4	'"The Bastard Son" by C.D. Shelton is a stimulating, dynamic and adventurous novel. The plot is situated in the England around the 16th century. A bit of history on life in the 16th century in England was popular. During this century trade and industry grew rapidly and this period became richer and richer. The main character in this story is Jonathan Winter who in which conquered hardships. He is known as the bastard son. In this novel you read about Jonathan Winter hardships and becoming a better person. His characterization is amazing. Winter\'s actions and bravery is a symbol in this story. This story reminds me of Game of Thrones, regarding the bastard son John Snow. Both John Snow and Jonathan Winter overcome their struggles and make them a better person at the end. Worth a read!'
4	'Action packed with a big screen thrill, this follow up lives up to the first in the Matt Drake series.'
4	'This was a fun read.  Moved along well, would have liked to get\nmore of an after ending about the main character. Maybe in the next book.'
4	"Good basic information.  The price can't be beat to see what he has to say on taking vitamins and certain supplements."
2	"This book didn't really draw me in. I didn't connect with any of the characters. I was over it when Anne has a Sexual encounter with another man. There was no sharing of bodily fluids, but it was sexual. The reasons behind it are stupid, even if is a part of the culture. To make her understand her feelings, and prepare her for dp. That was something they could have done for themselves. But it killed me how she just blindly went with it. No. Just no. This book is already short enough, and to introduce another man ruined it. Not sexy,and I skimmed after that part all the way up to the unsatisfying ending."
1	"Wasted my time. Does how even tell how to write a copy. His advice is to learn from other copywriters. I don't need a how-to book to tell me that. It should show me how."
2	'While I have read several Rosalind James novels and have enjoyed them, this book felt hum...how to put it??? Choppy, not a smooth flow between chapters or characters. Think of it like instead of chapters flowing smoothly and a constant it\'s feels broken up and jumpy. I liked Nina ok, felt sorry for her in the beginning but as I delved deeper into this story she just became weak and annoying! At times I felt she was being very unfair to Iain. He was strong and supportive, always looking out for Nina but did she see that?...no all she thought was he was trying to take over her life like she allowed EVERYONE else to her whole life!! So by being awesome and falling for her Iain gets the blunt of her being a bit*h and unfair to him because... " I need to find myself, be in charge of myself" blah!!! In the end what caused me to give this book 2 stars was our heroine Nina. I\'m not a huge fan of runners as my main female lead. I\'m a stand up and fight kinda gal and I like to read strong female leads. Nina was definitely not that. Throw in the whole Mathis the Prince being a pschyo stalker, wanna be rapist well then that\'s when this book left the decent read into WTF am I reading category!!! Loved Iain and Arthur, loved all the NZ phrases and descriptions, sadly didn\'t love this book :('
4	'This is book # 2 in the Code series.  For full understanding and enjoyment, I recommend reading the series books in order.  This book can be read as a standalone, but why just enjoy one book when you can enjoy more?\n\nMark meets Julie when she is hired to protect him. He is upset about this and makes it known that he does not wish her to take a bullet meant for him.  His father has already been injured and he refuses to be responsible for another life.\n\nJulie wants to be accepted as she is.  All the men she has dated in the past have never understood that she could take care of herself, much less another.  She has also never found anyone who could turn her on by just looking at her.  That is until Mark.\n\nWhile they discover so much so fast - and lets be honest this book moves quick, life and death situations tend to - about one another, they also fall as quickly as they discover each other.  I found myself rooting from them almost from the get go.  Their personalities and lives seemed to go together perfectly.\n\nJulie  accepts everything about Mark almost overnight, and he finds himself blinded by the light that is her.  I thought that their honesty and sexy times were what makes it work so well.\n\n***This ARC copy was given in exchange for an honest review.'
4	"This short story is pretty hard to describe.  A mortal woman, who is a sin eater, meets up with a soul bringer who is kind of ticked off because his delivery to 'below' is short because of her sin eating.  Neither has ever had a 'relationship', but are attracted to each other.  Despite my poor description, the story is easy to follow.  There are not a lot of writing issues like many free reads.  Interesting premise, free, and quick (about 30 minutes).  Well worth a read in my opinion."
3	'Charlotte Raine\'s Teacher Beware is a a thriller/romance which revolves around the lives of a substitute teacher, Grace, and a cardiologist, Sam, who meet while witnessing a double murder.  Inevitably, these two find they have much more in common than simply the blood splattered on their clothes.\n\nGrace, a recent resident of Murray, Virginia, is looking for a fresh start after a traumatic life event while Sam chooses to remain private in the hopes of protecting himself so as not to be hurt again, as he was growing up, by those whom were supposed to love him the most.  Sam himself expresses this reality, "I think about . . . my own obstacles in life.  I think about how scars shows [sic] someone who has lived thoroughly.  It shows someone who saw his or her worst fears and kept pushing forward"  (267-268).\n\nThus, I think the potential for deep characterization was there, but further development was needed in order for the reader to fully comprehend their unique situations and motivations as in the case with Deke, the troubled youth in the book.  As I would tell my students, slow down and take your time for fully developed second-order writing or MORE! MORE! MORE! written across the page.\n\nIn addition, a more thorough editing is needed throughout as there were abundant split infinitives (please, Peeps, do not let "not" separate to + verb), a subject/verb agreement error as noted above, and pronoun reference errors as in "Whenever I look at human [sic], I imagine their heart . . ."  (63).\n\nIf reading Teacher Beware for a book club, a selection of finger foods is preferred as an avoidance of the use of knives is a must.'
2	'The ending was too abrupt but it was an okay quick read. Could have had a bit more depth to it.'
4	"This was a very enjoyable read that hit two things I like in a story: historical romance, and m/m relationships. The story throws you into the mix from the very start with interesting characters and a plot that kept me reading. On top of that, the use of period-accurate language kept me engaged, and I even learned from some of the terms used. I'd love to see another installment of this, but I'll settle happily for another story."
3	'This has a good storyline, but it needs some more editing and rewriting. A lot of the passages are over-written, and I can definitely see what a previous reviewer says when mentioning that author pulled concepts from True Blood. Saw a LOT of typos. Too many errors for this to have been proofread by two editors and the author. Perhaps later editions will have fewer errors, but it and the overwriting still detracted from the story for me. Still a fun read, and I kept stealing time to get further in the storyline.'
1	"Dull, couldn't even finish it!"
4	'Loved it'
3	"Not the kind of story that I would normally read. There's no zombies, vampires or werewolves. This is not a doomsday book."
3	'I found my self caught up in the story of this man. I was so inspired have started to volunteer as an Honor Flight guardian.'
4	"This would have been a perfect book for the beach. If I'd only had a beach. But I thou thoroughly enjoyed it on my couch in front of the fire"
3	"This romance would be appropriate for any age group.  It is a sweet, simple love story.  The heroine through no fault of her own gets mixed up with a big drug cartel.  Her life is in danger as she flees California and winds up in the mountains of Montana.  Sick and in no condition to travel, she is picked up by the local Sheriff.  He turns out to be the hero in this story.\n\nLucky for the heroine, he has training with the FBI and helps to solve some of her problems.  I was glad to see that we didn't have to go through a lot of scenes with the bad guys, we just concentrated on the story between the lady and the Sheriff.  It is a sweet, Christmas romance.  I would definitely recommend it to young readers as well as Christian readers.\n\nI was not paid for this review.  I am not an author nor do I know one.  I am not kin to this writer.  I am a reader and this is just my o9pinion, nothing more, nothing less."
4	'I totally enjoyed this book will read more from this author.'
4	'Ok read. Not as good as the first two in the trilogy, but still have good read would have liked another ending.'
1	"I just felt like something was missing.  Will not recommend as wasn't very good."
4	"This book was free and the cover was interesting so I read it even though it had some bad reviews. I'm glad I read it. I really liked this book. The brothers were both hot and I would read Daman's book if it comes out."
4	"Another entertaining story.  I didn't know what the reasons for her betrayal until the end.  Good twist.  As always enjoyed this series and this author's work. Recommend."
1	"Couldn't finish and I tried twice to do so.  Made it to 53%.  So not a fan of the h.  She's a very weak character. Book is too repetative.  Do hope it ends well but will never know."

2	'I enjoyed the book but if ur gonna make the book about a stalker and stick with that through the entire book I need more then that for an ending. Disappointed. Who was the dam stalker?????!!! Nope'
4	'Enjoyed the way the story evolved. From the title I thought Clarissa\' s magic would be featured more, but I appreciated that it was secondary to the main mystery. Looking forward to seeing if there is more to what happens to several of the characters introduced in this book, especially "Cat,\'s" role.'
2	"I LOVE adult coloring books. Some of my pages have taken days to finish because I spend a lot of time thinking about the actual art of the coloring page. I have had people frame and hang coloring pages that I have finished as art.  Sadly, half of the book is just educational information about color and coloring. There are only 14 coloring pages in this book and they only cover 2/3 of the page. I prefer a full page to color. You cannot easily print these pages to actually color. You can't just select a page and print it out. There is a link where you can sign up for free downloadable coloring pages, but sadly these are not guaranteed to be on that page. Granted this was the kindle edition of this book, but I would still like to be able to have access to print my pages.\nOverall, the art is good, the information is nice, but not being able to color your coloring book makes it NOT a coloring book and just a picture book.\nI'd pass on this purchase in the future unless they add a download and printable version.\n\n**I received this item at a discount in exchange for a fair and honest review.

4	'I am glad to have read this story without reading how Couria got to this point.....for it gave me the chance to see how someone could find a way to start anew.'
4	'The Yellow Scarf is a hard-hitting, gripping novella that commanded my attention all the way through. There was very little "down" time in the book; the action moves steadily, but it doesn\'t overshadow the character development that is so essential, especially in short stories where there is less room to develop the characters. Ms. Duncan does a fantastic job of combining plot with detailed character construction, and brings the novella to a fitting and climactic end. I particularly enjoyed the character of Alexei; I could see him as vividly as if I were watching him on the screen in front of me.\n\nReally enjoyed this read. If you like true crime fiction, this is a good one to pick.'
3	"This book started out with great momentum & so much potential. i couldn't wait to pick it up & read more... and then it ended. Just like that.\nWhat a letdown. I am sorely disappointed... sigh"
1	"This book says very little.  Some orchids need more light,  some need less. Some orchids need more water, some need less. No duh!  Not only was this book uninformative but poorly edited. Don't waste your time or money."

1	"I found only an introduction to this study guide. Statistics is not what I was looking for either.  I expected questions & answers to be available, instead I found this review page, which I couldn't get away from unless I participated. So, I realize this study guide was inexpensive...good thing because I didn't get what I wanted."
4	"What a fun story! I am a fan of Dancing with the Stars, and this book is set around a very similar show, with a romance added in.\n\nJC Webster, Olympic swimmer, has accepted a position as a star on Dance off, a dance competition show on TV. Hes very athletic, but not a dancer so hes excited to meet his partner and get started dancing. What he doesnt expect is to find himself attracted to fellow competitor Olivier Gautier, a French rugby player. JC is open about his bisexuality, but Olivier is not, rugby not being a safe sport for a gay man. Both try to be cool about their attraction to the other, knowing that this is not he time and place to start anything. Not only are cameras on them a whole lot of the time, but they don't want to cause any issues among the other competitors. JC is supported by his large Hispanic family, staying at his Abuelas house instead of the competitors house, which makes it easier for him to ignore the lure of Olivier, but it gets harder for him to handle the commute to and from the house and the studio. As JC and Olivier make their way through the competition and grow closer, Olivier convinces JC to stay in the house and things get interesting\n\nSo I enjoyed this story, but it was a focused more on the competition than the romance. I got tired of reading the scores and comments after the performances. It was fun for a bit, then it got old. I liked the competition as a background to the romance, I just wished there had been a little more romance. I didn't feel the emotional connection between JC and Olivier as much as I would have liked. There were a couple of very nice sex scenes between them, and some sexy dancing, but I wish there had been more time with just the two of them. I think if they had spent some time getting to know each other I would have felt it more. There are a lot of other characters in the book, all of the other competitors, and we get lots about them. Almost a little too much at times. It distracted me from the romance between JC and Olivier. The same with JC family, lots about his mother and grandmother, and visits by his siblings. It was cute for a while, but also got old. Being a fan of Dancing with the Stars, I could see personality traits in the judges in the book that paralleled the judges on the show, that was fun to read.\n\nNow I sound like I didn't like the book, and I really did like it! It was cute and fun, a bit of fluffiness in contrast to darker stories I have read recently. I liked the writing, I liked the characters, especially JC and Olivier, I liked the setting of the dance competition, and I liked the ending.\n\nOverall it was an enjoyable book! If you are looking for a light read, this is a good one. If you are a fan of reality television, and dance shows in particular, youll probably like this one."
2	'Nothing pisses me off more than thinking I have plenty  of story left to go and coming to the words "The End" and when the story ends at 51%, there is a problem!! If there is another story that should be mentioned on the cover. Also I was very distracted by missing words and sentences that didn\'t make sense, not a lot of them, but enough so that you don\'t say "oh, she just missed that one" you say "oh come on!! Again?? What was that supposed to say? Let me guess what word is missing or what that sentence was supposed to say"  I will now go back to 51% and see what the other 49% of the book is. I don\'t think I will read anything more from this author, tho I like the stories, she rushes them makes mistakes and then only gives half a book'
4	"What is not to like about a book that opens with the main character (Alice) sighting Elvis browsing in the cat food aisle at Sainsbury's.\n\nAlice lives with her second husband in a leafy London suburb. But when her Bohemian mother falls ill, Alice has to go to Cornwall to look after her, and she begins to wonder if she has made the right life choices.\n\nThis is an amusing look at family relationships - the expectations we have of those nearest and dearest to us; the changing relationships between mothers and daughters and granddaughters as we age; our perceptions vs the reality of our marriages; the choices we make, and the sometimes inconsequential reasonings behind them.\n\nI will be reading more from Judy Astley."
1	'Brother takes money from a gang of thieves, then everyone involved makes stupid choices which end in the h getting kidnapped. Combine that with people acting totally inappropriately for their class and times, and you have a novel which seems to have no purpose except to move along the unbelievable plot. Add in poor grammar and misused words and it becomes a story not really worth reading.'
1	"This short story is not worth the paper it is written on. It is merely a rehash of information already revealed in the earlier books. Save your time and money - just skip it. Trust me, you're not missing anything."
3	"I absolutely love this series. Jordyn  is such a strong tormented heroin. I can't wait to see where the story goes after the final scene. That being said I first read this book 4 years ago and am still waiting for book 3. I feel it's been too long unless this 3rd book is going to be extremely lengthy.for this reason only i give it 3 stars."
1	'There was not much of a story line or character development.  It is a stand alone story even Hough it is part of a series.'

4	"I liked the book. Wasn't amazing and it had a few grammar errors but overall a good read with the darker side of high school."
4	'I enjoyed this a lot. There were a few times that I felt that I had missed something, but they were minor enough to not cause much trouble. I will read the second book.'
4	'Short, sweet and fun.  Read the whole series..waiting for more.'
3	"Part of the book was pretty good but towards the end I kind of lost interest and skimmed through to the end. This book was just too clean for me( no knock your socks off love scenes) and lacked any anticipation or excitement, unlike some other time travel books I've read. Was also a tad bit predictable."
4	'I have immensely  enjoyed reading book 2. I am curious to know the reasoning behind some decisions but do to SPOILER issues, will not mention them here. I will just have to chalk it up to a whole lot of crazy. But not knowing how things got to this point in society, prior to book 1, could answer most of my questions.\n My only major complaint would be an increased amount of editing errors in this book. Although admittedly, I am crazy about grammar., as one of the precursors to a fall of society is a loss of its language.'
4	'Stories are good, but some gramatical and/or typing errors.'
3	'Story line was okay. Had a some errors in it.\nLoved the one liners That was funny as $**t.\nStory never really explained why  a mother hated her daughter so much.  Had a hard time with parents wanting to kill their own flesh and blood.\nOne sister had gone through so much in life it was unbelievable.\nStrong male characters with emotional turmoil.\nHonestly not sure if ill read book 2 when it comes out.'
3	'I\'d give this book a 3.3-3.4 rating.\n\nThis story has a good foundation and has some elements I like. It does feel, though, a little rough and would be much stronger with some help from an astute editor.\n\nI\'ll start with what I didn\'t like and then go into what I did.\n\nBasically, I found the blurb to be more interesting than what the book delivered. The characters Rebecca and Kayleigh are likable enough but something about their portrayal kept them shallow in a one-dimensional way. There\'s a little bit of drama and angst on both their parts but, when it appeared, it felt rushed and somewhat contrived. There was just something a little too easy about everything between them that veered into the syrupy sweet realm and the characters were both stand up people with no issues or personal weaknesses. lol...I guess I want some drama in that respect.\n\nThere\'s nothing particularly punchy about the dialogue, though it\'s written well enough, so that with the lack of angst gave some flatness to the novel.\n\nWhat I think would\'ve been incredibly interesting and also a completely unique storyline I haven\'t encountered yet is if Kayleigh, the token straight woman, took her sexuality and newfound relationship in stride while Rebecca, the experienced lesbian, was the nervous wreck, afraid of her feelings and committing, pushing Kayleigh away. Instead, there\'s a hint of "should I, shouldn\'t I" from Kayleigh and no hesitation at all from Rebecca, which isn\'t how the blurb described it.\n\nAlso, I noticed this more in the latter half of the book but the wording of paragraphs sometimes felt clunky, either in description or, more rarely, in the dialogue. At times, especially in the intimate moments, we get a lot of description but not the emotion the characters are feeling and thinking during them. Some rephrasing and streamlining could go far here.\n\nFor plot, the story is more of a romance with a ghost story popping in and out here and there. We also get flashback scenes portraying the family that used to live in the home that in some ways parallels the lives of Kayleigh, Rebecca and Sarah (Kayleigh\'s daughter) which I thought was well done. I didn\'t find the story to be scary or freaky...for the most part. The ghost story was actually pretty grim on all parts which was both good and bad...good in that it was well portrayed, bad in that I don\'t like seeing bad things happen to good people.\n\nI actually like reading about characters that are typically straight and then go lesbian that DON\'T agonize over it. So, bonus for Kayleigh\'s character.\n\nThe book\'s setting takes place in South Africa so that along with exposure to a war I\'d never heard of before adds to the interesting elements.\n\nOn the whole, there\'s a good premise here but I would\'ve really have liked to have seen the author push deeper into Kayleigh and Rebecca\'s characters and give them more complex interaction. It\'s a decent read, though. If you want a simple, sweet love story you may like this.'
4	"Carly had just graduated from college and had no where to really go so she went to her brother's house in a beach resort town. She was only going to stay for a month until she figured out what to do with her life. Maddy, was seriously dating her brother, Colin.  Maddy was slowly moving out her the condo she shared with two men into Colin's place. Carly met her hot roommates again. This time, her roommate Macon, noticed Carly and gave her a long body encompassing look. Wow. She liked that.\n\nAgain, a great book from Alyssa. I'm glad I finished the Hazard series, I needed a change from the Harrison peeps. A change in location was good too. In this book the characters are older and more mature. I appreciated that.\n\nMy con is that everyone seems to have the exact same same sex in her books. It's the same routine - kissing, grabbing junior, hands up the leg, push over the panties if they were still on, fingers in, then junior in. Every single time. Never any hint at oral which surprises me. Who doesn't like oral? Not even in showers, lakes, or the ocean in her books even though the characters enjoy their moments in water. Just plain old vanilla every single time. It needs to be shaken up a bit.\n\nI'm not going to read the other book in the series. It appears to be about Maddy and Colin from when they met. I already know that conclusion so I have no desire to read about what happened before Carly was in town. It feels like I cheated and opened up to the last pages of a book. Oh well, moving on... I wish it was about Brody.\n\nThe book was nicely done in dual POVs so you could see the relationship grow on both sides. The editing was great."

4	'In this third "Texas Girl" book, Monica, the youngest of the Witte sisters, gets to have her story told. And as she did with the two other sisters, author Kristina Knight brings the story of this Texas girl to life with style and passion.\n\nIn the first few pages of the book,she gets the reader quickly into Monica\'s life--both personal and professional. Monica is a barrel racer who rides the rodeo circuit, returning home every few months for R&R and a little attention from Trickett Samuels, the vet in her small home town.\n\nMonica has always wanted to keep Trick out of her heart but in her bed. However, when Jinx, her horse, is injured, she has to spend real time at home and come to terms with what she wants. Is it life on the circuit or with Trick? Can she have both? Does she want both?\n\nKnight\'s writing is clean, crisp and easy on the reader. She develops her characters so well you know exactly who they are and understand why they do what they do, even if you don\'t agree. And she always, always knows how to lead them through to a happily-ever-after.\n\nI\'ve been lucky enough to read all three of her books as an advanced reader. And I\'ve loved every minute of reading them. You will too.'
2	'A scientist in an ally gets jumped by two men. All the sudden a man comes out of nowhere and kicks some butt. Ok that sounds cool right? Well i found this story lacking in a lot of areas. The story was RUSHED. The feelings just were not there for me. I felt like i was reading one of those kungfu movies with awful horror subtitles. You know the ones the mouths stop moving and hes still talking. This would make a cute little story for my nephew if there was no sex scenes which were there but poorly wrote. So thats my suggestion remove the sex scenes and make it into a book for boys.'
4	'Refreshing'
1	'The story was over simplified in sentence structure to the point of loss of interest. Also VERY poorly edited. Not believable partly because of lack of details to events. Major battles were fought and won in single paragraphs. On the other hand he has written and published which is more than I have done.'
4	"Very sexy and good for a quick read if you don't have time to for a novel. Really enjoyed it."
1	'Be careful, everyone.  The email I received said this book was free, so I ordered it.  Then got charged $3.99 for it.  This is not the first time this has happened.  BE CAREFUL!'
2	"I hate stories which end so aburptly you're wondering what the hell the author was thinking.  There is much more to this story that should have been writen. The over all story line is good and the sex hot, but that's all this book does for you."
4	'I really wished that it had more stories to it. It should have about like all of the books in the story. Otherwise, the book is awesome.'
2	'This book started off with a good story, a man who lost his wife looking for a fresh start. Then he meets James and the sexual tension was good. By the time I got to them "writing their own version of the Poem of Ecstasy " and "they shared the same fever, Love Fever", I knew I was done. Ugh.'
4	'It went a huge distance  to explain the evolution of bond and the direction the plots took and where blocked unspecified went. Fleming created and the business of movies could have killed bond, hooray for Hollywood.'
3	"Nicholas Blue and Reba Duvall have been friends for years, brought together by mutual friend, Marty. They traveled the rodeo circuit together, and while Reba was always interested in Nick, she didn't pursue it because she didn't want her heart broken. When Monty is killed during a ride, they end up spending one night together, and Nick runs far and fast before she wakes up. A year later, Nick's life has changed, finding out Boots Kelly was his father and fulfilling the terms of the will. Reba has been trying to find him for months, and heads to Whiskey River to see him and introduce him to his baby daughter, Martina. Nick obviously wants to be a part of Martina's life, but can he and Reba make a life together?\nI wanted to love this story, but it didn't click completely with me. I didn't feel the chemistry with Reba and Nick, and I really wasn't sure they fit. They were friends for a long time, but I didn't feel the attraction. I also felt the timeline was odd. Nick's thought process was a little odd to me. The story was good, I just wish it and the characters had been developed a little more so I felt invested in them and their relationship. The over all series was great, and I wouldn't miss a part of it.\n**I was given an Advanced Reader's Copy by the Publisher via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."
4	"It's hard to say the mood is really dark....yes, humanity is nearly gone, but the the survivors keep pushing on. This series has a unique feel to it, a really great creepiness interlaced with hard core pulse pounding action. Love Sisavath's style."
3	"I can't remember this book really....therefore is doesn't really give a lasting impression. I am nice so three stars anyway!"
4	'Loved it but wanted a whole story not a series'
4	"Good Paleo diet book with plenty of tips and tricks. I didn't care for a few of the ideas, but the rest worked very well."
1	"I've been reading all the books that Andrew has been writing, and it finally got so tiring I had to stop reading this book.  Granted his books are saccharine sweet affairs, but this book jumped all over the place so much i couldn't follow the story line.  I wanted a hero, but the hero kept changing, so I gave up."
3	'I can\'t even begin to describe how disappointed I was that The Selection didn\'t turn out to be the five-star read I was hoping it would be. I\'ve been looking forward to reading it since forever. I won it in a giveaway and out of all the books I could choose for a prize, I chose this one. You can almost say my disappointment have thus been doubled as had I known that the first 40% of this book would be a carbon copy of The Hunger Games (which I loved, so by the way), I might\'ve picked something else. But anyway, it\'s really my own fault. I, as always, didn\'t read the blurb and was enchanted by the absolutely gorgeous cover.\n\nLet\'s get to the "why".  Why was I so disappointed in the first 40% of this book? Well, simply because the endless similarities to The Hunger Games were a little too much. Yes, of course the author changed it slightly and added something minuscule here and there, but the similarities to THG were so overwhelming, I didn\'t feel she added anything new to capture my imagination in a way THG hadn\'t already done. Another 10% into the book the story reminded me a lot of Megg Jensen\'s Anathema, but only because the palace scenes brought back memories of this terrific first book in the Cloud Prophet series.\n\nDon\'t even get me started on the main character. Ugh. Can you say drama queen? America\'s woe-is-me treatment (due to her own preconceived ideas) of Maxon shortly after she met him for the first time was cringe-worthy. This of course is no reflection on the overall feel of the book, but only my personal dislike of characters who - when the world doesn\'t revolve around them - turns it into an overly dramatic production. Naturally, once she gets over "the hurt" and "betrayal" and blah blah blah, of being dumped by Aspen, she becomes more likeable - that is, until she meets up with him again near the end of the book. I just couldn\'t get a liking in Aspen either. Compared to Maxon, he seemed so...annoying. At times he was a bigger drama queen than America. It\'s just so darn annoying always having to first suffer through the drama and angst of yet another love-triangle.  Heaven only knows why I\'m a magnet for books with the he-loves-her-but-she-loves-someone-else theme in the plot. If it wasn\'t so predictable, I wouldn\'t be complaining about it. But nooooooo, most such books are all the friggin\' same. I can name half a dozen books that are the exception.\n\nHow do I warrant a three-star rating for this book? Simple, really. There are a lot of good things to be said about a book which keeps me reading way past my bedtime into the early hours of the morning. With character names such as America, Aspen, Tuesday, Tiny, Bariel, and May, not to mention the very imaginative last names Singer and Farmer, this is testament to the author\'s creativity and original way of thinking. But it doesn\'t end there. Stellar characterization of Prince Maxon made him the only character I liked from start to end. Even though I didn\'t like America one bit in the first half of the book, I liked her a lot more once she and Maxon became steady friends. Their friendship was sincere and their easy dialogue made it feel real. I especially enjoyed the scenes in which they were together and they were being open with each other. Once the Hunger Games fanfic chapters came to an end and the author started introducing her own ideas into the storyline, it held my interest straight through the last half of the book to the cliff-hanger ending. The world building was done incredibly well and while inside the palace, I found the story to be a lot more enjoyable. The writing is flawless and engaging, and the story moves at a comfortable pace allowing the reader to indulge in every little detail from the beautiful dresses to the magnificent palace decor.\n\nAlthough the hours spent reading The Selection was not a complete waste of my time, I\'m not sure yet if I\'ll read the second book in this series, but I\'ll admit that I would love to see if America\'s character will be a little more mature and less dramatic in the next installment, and of course who she\'ll choose.'
4	'I really liked this book, but the loads of spelling and grammar problems were a drag, including multiple variations of the dreaded "could of." The FBI stuff really felt "real," and I liked it despite the spelling. I\'d like to give it 3 stars, but I liked it too much for that. So ... be aware!'
4	'A very good read. Kept me interested to the end. Enjoyed the characters, South African setting and spiritual dimensions.'
3	'The story was good up until Book 4. Then it got boring and stupid. Some of the decisions Andie makes are pretty stupid. And the whole FBI sting is not believable.'
4	"Your SEO Sucks has really helped me to better understand SEO and how to use it to the maximum benefit when promoting a website. The language of this book is easy to follow and instructions are given in clear and concise terms. The action plans suggested are not only easily implemented, none of them are plans that rely on building unrelated spam backlinks! So many times books that have promised to tell how to optimize SEO are full of bad advice that won't work long-term. I have a better understanding of how Google ranks websites and exactly what can be done on page to improvised ranking, as well as a new knowledge of off-site SEO basics. The information given about Google's search algorithm works and how to build backlinks was a revelation to me.\n\nThe reason gave this 4 of 5 stars is that I feel a more in depth glossary of terms and acronyms would have made this guide to SEO more accessible to the layman or beginner. Despite that this was well worth reading and will certainly be referenced as I implement new SEO for my employers website."

3	"Flawed by Author Tracy Wolff is book four in the Ethan Frost series.  It is a standalone, contemporary romance, enemies-to-lovers novel.\n\nTori is having a bad day...a REALLY bad day.  To add insult to injury, when she shows up at the one place she thinks will be her refuge, she finds Miles Gerard there.  He is her nemesis, her arch enemy, and he's not going to give he an inch up to her.\n\nTold in dual points of view, Flawed was a tug of war, never give in, novel. I absolutely loved the first three books in this series. Seeing Ethan and Chloe again and adding Miles and Tori to the mix was a great delight. This novel had all of the heat I've come to expect from Author Tracy Wolff and was definitely my favorite part of the story, all of the build-up to an explosion of lust. It also had some of the most descriptive and sweat-inducing kisses.\n\nThe main conflict in the story was intense, but mostly the same throughout.  Miles was protective, loving, and his true character was finally seen in a true light.  I did expect a bit more from Tori, assuming that she was a force to be reckoned with through and through, but coming up a bit whiny at times. I did appreciate though that the author showed some of her vulnerable side along with her unsuspected weakness.  Flawed was a nice addition to the Ethan Frost series."
4	'A very good collection of short stories related to Time Travel. nearly all stories were captivating. Worthwhile as a survey of authors who are successful in this genre.'
4	"Fun read, great action. Enough history to keep the story on the rails but not a slave to it. Some of the characters, particularly the romantic interests, got a big unrealistic over time, but that's picking nits."
4	"I thoroughly enjoyed the whole box set. It reminded me of the Hardy Boys Mysteries that I loved so much growing up. I had to keep coming back because I wanted to know what would happen next with the characters. Mary is a great story teller and she captures the imagination with realistic options and characters. She doesn't shy away from arguing both sides of the scriptures as holy debate, nor hide the fact some of her characters are Christian. They profess openly and unashamedly their belief in the one true God. A good series. I would recommend whole heartedly."
4	"heavy reading, but a good outsider's view\nof a topic, by a skilled observer and writer.\nProbably, a must read."
4	'Can read this in about an hour. Interesting details make me want more color and back stories.\n\nSome typos in the text.'
1	'"Start at the toes...Tighten, tighten...Rebuild. Rebuild..." --I cannot tell you how many times the author had her horribly insecure heroine speaking those lines in her head as a calming exercise, but it was about 50 too many. Why have a heroine who was called a fierce businesswoman, who was an Olympian medal winner,  and who owned and ran a major newspaper in Chicago be such a TOTAL emotional and insecure wreck and constantly allow herself to be manipulated??? It not only baffled, but produced a miserable book.\n\nThe hero was said to run a security specialist company, but he was really a wuss and the bad guys-in both the sabotage of their relationship and in committing crimes-were blatantly obvious. The romance was lackluster and every characters was hollow, unimpressive and just darn unlikable.\n\nThe narrator was annoying. Her speaking tone was really too old for this book and she gave the hero an awful whispery soft-spoken voice.'
4	'Good book, although the Horde could have used more imagination. Sounded like an Earth starfish/Octopus.\nStory line is good, I had some hope for Ray.....'
3	'It was nice not to have to read through a long, full-length book. If you\'re looking for what you might call a "quick fix" this might do it for you. It seemed to lack real substance, so I guess you can\'t have it both ways... I\'m going to reread it to get the most out of it I can. Meantime I would say that it\'s an okay read.'
4	'The four books in this series share a common theme - unhappy urban women meet hunky Montana men. The dangerous and complicated story elements range from corporate treason and murder in "Elizabeth\'s Hero," arson in "Cowboy Dad," greedy, selfish parents in "Winter Awaking," to a single father of four. The beauty and serenity of big sky country soothes feminine souls, while the heros win their hearts. The characters are genuine. Linked by past histories, they all have hopeful futures. There is enough tension to excite the reader and enough romance to warm their hearts.'
1	'I had no idea this book would contain so much carnage...I just could not get beyond the images of children, if contaminated by the "virus", savagely killing and eating flesh.... I\'m just too squeeeemish for this type of reading adventure. Shoot, I can\'t even watch Fringe type TV.'
1	'Oh, gosh. If I\'d read a couple of the bad reviews rather than simply glancing at the average review score, I probably wouldn\'t have purchased this book. My bad. Still, I hope that others might learn from my mistake.\n\nFor starters, let\'s just admit that getting into any zombie book requires (at least at this point in time...) a suspension of belief. But this book requires that you remove your braaaaiinnns and leave them at the door for your friendly neighborhood undead.\n\nWhy? Well, first, there\'s the set-up. Although I really liked the idea of a bunch of people getting stranded on a yacht during a zombie plague, the fact that the main character won the lottery and had every bit of survivalist gear aboard the boat was a little too much to handle. Food for months, weapons caches, submarines, helicopters, extra boats -- yep, it was all there. You know, I think they even had a unicorn that pooped Skittles below deck! Seriously, though: When you have all that stuff available, what\'s the challenge? What\'s left for the characters to do?\n\nSecond, let\'s talk about the characters themselves. Okay, forget that. There\'s nothing to talk about because they\'re all characters you\'ve seen before: cardboard cut-outs. You know them, don\'t you? The main dude, a tough hombre who can do just about anything with his awesome abs glistening in the sunset. His hot wife. His genius son. His awesome friends, all of whom speak in useless military jargon. In short, this is a zombie version of "As the World Turns." Bleh.\n\nFinally, there\'s the author\'s politics. While they\'re not absolutely hardcore right-wing, they\'re obviously present, and don\'t make the author look like the sharpest pickaxe in the zombie brain. Consider, for example, a scene in which the main character excoriates the President of the USA for his televised message telling the people of the country that the government will find a cure and help them. The main character complains that the President is just blowing smoke at the people. Well, duh. But would any president have been better served by telling citizens, "Sorry folks! That\'s it: you\'re screwed. Just bend over and kiss your butts good bye." As if hopelessness wouldn\'t cause even more panic and death. Come on!\n\nOne positive about this book is that it doesn\'t have atrocious grammar. So woo hoo there.'
4	'A sweet romance but hard to believe two people were so unaware of their feelings.'
2	"I should have known it was going to be short but reading it in 15 minutes. This is why I usually don't buy case interviews."
4	'Excellent as well as exciting, some common practice we should take care of and do recall when we have time, the author described the process perfectly and with a perfect sense.'
4	'A bit boring not too exciting seemed to be one story that can be broken down into other short stories'
4	"Marriage by Law\nBy: N.K. Pockett\n4/5 stars\n\nWhat happens when you realize that your parents are forcing you to fulfill a 5 generations old marriage agreement, in which you will marry the heir to a family whose business could be a direct competitor to your familys business, but won't be because of the marriage between the two heirs to each family?\n\nThats exactly what happened to Ivory. She didn't really have a choice in the matter and thus became a bride to Darius. He too was fulfilling his familys end of the marriage contract. But while we were in Ivorys head and knew that she was dreading this marriage, we never really knew what Darius was thinking.\n\nBecause of this, Darius seemed almost cold and completely indifferent to her, especially with all the business phone calls he took anytime they were together (and probably all the time!). So for a while, they weren't a real couple at all and their interactions were cold and forced. But eventually, little things start happening and little by little, they become more open with each other and fairly long into the book, they turned it into a real marriage.\n\nI absolutely loved the character of Adrian, Dariuss crazy cousin. He was able to bring Darius to an understanding of just how much he had in Ivory, he just had to let go and get to know her. He was a friend to Ivory, when she was in dire need of one, who especially knew her husband well. And further, Adrian was just freaking hilarious!"
4	"The story of Dragon Dreams centres around two young people Auri and Nachal and how their lives become intertwined in their quest to stop an evil dragon and cure a dying world.\n\nDusty does a great job of creating a detailed world in which the protagonists' adventures take place. She also creates a cast of believable supporting characters although the dwarf feels under used given the importance placed on his being a part of the ensemble.\n\nAs a fellow author of dragon stories I love the way Dusty handles her dragons, they are very understated until the story required they be otherwise.\n\nThere were a couple of points that niggled with me that meant this book didn't quite make 5 stars, if I could give it 4 1/2 stars I would have; there's a prop that appears out of nowhere and the final chapter discusses a place with a name that lacks all inspiration. After the wonderfully named Elven, Dwarven and Human lands and cities it seems so out of character that it jarred with me just at the point the book was ending."
1	'The fourth book in this series of "The Lost Girls" is far from as good as the earlier books in the series. The first three had a mix of action (people going places, doing things, etc.) and relationships (people relating with other people). This book has way less action and more on relationships. I suppose if you\'re into relationships over actions you\'d have a different opinion, but this book had shifted the balance a bunch. Also, the "kick ass" main character from earlier books gets much more mellow in this book, she does little good in an action sense and everything is done to her instead. She\'s shown as much more of a victim than before.\n\nAlso, there are big gaps in logic (spoiler alert follows). In the final big scene our hero is down and out when with no explanation how, her lover and her father both show up to save her. How this could happen was not described at all. Must be magic. Other examples of gaps in logic abound.\n\nAll in all a disappointment and if there are further books in this series I will not be reading them. Lost one reader anyway.'
3	'Way too short. If it were to be a short story it should have stated that it was one. Needs to be longer.'
4	'This book was a pretty good read. It started off very quickly but was clean and only issues I had was some of the language. One issue I did have was that it seemed to run together on thoughts. I would have to reread sections because what I thought was Chris then would turn into Corrine and would confuse me a bit. Other than that, it was a nice story of lust that grew into love and learning to overcome past mistakes and turn it into your true love!'
4	'Book is well constructedv but with some gaps. Waiting to read the second part eagerly!\nI would classify this book as I the top 20 but not in top 5\nIf the next parts develop the hero and dragon more I would rate the author higher.'

One has better odds getting hit by lightning twice or winning the lottery.\nThis author doesn\'t deliver consistently. Some of her books are entertaining,  others seem hurried and not well developed.

3	"I found this book to be interesting with just enough story to keep me hooked. It occurred to me that it seemed to be trying to teach me about government and economics. Luckily it didn't delve too deeply into that. I enjoyed the characters and how well the story developed even though it wasn't very long."

2	'I really did not like the book at all, I feel that it is not worth the money.  the reasons I have for this is that one all the stories seem to be cliff hanger, there is like no real story to any of these,  I enjoyed Sylvia Day story but feel like there is something still to come, you just get into it and then the story ends and you like what the hell .... happened? this book should not be on sale for $5.00 when the stories are not even complete!!!!!'

4	"I received an advanced copy of this book in return for an  honest review.\n\nAfter reading Amy Bird's previous book, Yours is Mine, I was excited to see how she could follow it up. I was surprised to find that it was a completely different type of story and even more intrigued to find her writing from a male point of view. It worked very well for me although I did find it difficult to get into the very strange thought processes of our narrator.\n\nI am glad I stuck it out, as the story takes a very dark and murderous turn and leaves the reader totally in the dark as to who is the real victim.\n\nI will certainly be watching out for more from Amy Bird."

4	"This book starts out with Ray Collins murdering a man in a park in the middle of the day. The murderer just smiles and walks away while the victim's fiance screams. DCI Jones and his protg, Detective Sergeant Phil Cryer, investigate this difficult case, not finding a motive for this crime.\n\nThe story is unusual in that we know right away who the killer is. It's the police that don't know so we see how they use their investigative skills to find out who was responsible for the death. It was good to get the killer's and investigator's viewpoints.\n\nRight from the start I thought that Ray Collins was a jerk. That wasn't a good start to the story for me and I was tempted to stop reading. But I did finish it and liked the police investigation aspect of this book. Other than Collins the characters are likeable making this a good start to the DCI Jones series.\n\nIf you are looking for a good, quick murder mystery, this book is for you."

3	"Overall thoughts\n\nREXD: Welcome to Scholomance is a fun, fast-paced, entertaining book for readers of many ages. While the novel contains elements and themes from the horror genre, it is not too scary nor violent, making it perfect for younger readers that are interested in horror. The novel is also very accessible due to the natural flow of the story and because of the simplicity of the language. Due to the novel being primarily for younger audiences, older readers might find the story quite simple and straightforward, but it is nonetheless an entertaining read. As a whole, Id be inclined to rate the book with 3.5 out of 5 stars, which Ill round down to 3. While I did like and enjoy the book, I was not amazed by it. However, it does make me want to read the rest of the entries in the series. Please read below for a more detailed explanation of my thoughts, which might contain some minor spoilers.\n\nPlot, themes & characters\n\nThe plot of the book follows the story of Rex and his dad. They move to a new town after his mothers death. This place happens to be the town in which she wanted to live in someday in the future. Throughout the story, we find out more information surrounding her death and soon learn that things might not be as they seem at first glance. This is particularly true once it is revealed that the town has some links to the paranormal. Rex, being a horror aficionado, is thrilled by his findings, which leads him to an adventure involving vampires, wolves, and various other monsters.\n\nAs one can imagine, some of the biggest themes and elements in the book revolve around the horrific and the macabre though, as mentioned earlier, these topics are addressed in a simple manner that makes it accessible and not too scary or traumatizing for younger readers. While there are certain monsters or supernatural entities that are outright mentioned, such as the werewolves and vampires, there are others that are simply hinted at or alluded to. Furthermore, there is also an exploration of the lore and history of the place, indicating that there is much to learn about the paranormal world in the universe of the novel. Naturally, Rex is intrigued by all of these things and eventually finds out how hes connected to this paranormal world.\n\nThe second set of important themes are the ones revolving the social dynamics and the social life of Rex. Although there is a certain degree of exploration on these subjects, it is not very deep nor complex. Since Rex is new to the town, we are exposed to his feelings, thoughts, and difficulties with fitting in. We are also exposed to some type of bullying dynamics, and a sort of teenage rivalry among high schoolers. In the middle of this disagreement, we can find one of the main issues between the two boys: a girl, which shouldnt be very surprising to older readers. Thanks to this girl, however, we also get to see the social skills of Rex when talking to girls. All in all, Rex seems to be a quite average teenage boy, which might make it easy for readers to identify with.\n\nTwo themes that are alluded to are the family dynamics and the relationship between kids and adults, though these themes are not as exposed or developed as the previous two. The majority of the family dynamics that we are exposed to as readers are between Rex and his father, and to some degree, we get to learn about how family functioned when the mom was still alive. We also get to see brief instances in which other teenagers interact with their respective parents, though this is quite minor. There are certain aspects indicating that their dynamics are different, which might explain some of their traits. Due to the context of the story, the kids interact with adults at various points of the story. It is interesting to see how some of the adults seem to be more interested in what the kids have to say while others dismiss them outright. This could be explained by the differences in their profession, however. This aspect is not very important in the book though.\n\nLastly, I would like to address the characters. There aren't that many characters in the book, which shouldnt be too surprising based on the length. For the most part, these characters are not very intricate or profound. In fact, the majority are unfortunately rather average and dull. There is very little character development, which is mostly done on the protagonist. Hopefully, there will be more development on this aspect in future entries of the series.\n\nUse of language and narration\n\nThe novel is written in a third person perspective. It makes it quite easy to jump between different scenes seamlessly and effortlessly. While the language is easy to understand and easy to follow, it is also quite average. There aren't phrases or sections that are incredibly well written nor particularly memorable. However, since the book is aimed mostly towards young readers, the fast pace and the accessible language are quite suitable.\n\nRecommendations and suggestions for further reading\n\nId recommend this book to anyone that is interested in reading a book with horror elements that isn't too scary. Id also recommend this book to those that like young adult or middle-grade literature, or to those that are only looking for a quick, easy and entertaining read. As for further recommendations, for those looking for something of similar difficulty and some horror elements, Id suggest The Graveyard Book by Neil Gaiman. However, for those interested in something fast-paced with a similar style and mood but in different genres, then Id recommend Strings by G. Miki Hayden for sci-fi fans and The Code of Magic by David D. Hammons for fantasy fans. For those looking something similar but aimed towards older readers, then Id recommend Malus Domestica by S.A. Hunt.\n\nThank you for reading my review. Happy reading!"
4	"Having high self-confidence can help you succeed in many areas of your personal and professional life, but many people struggle with low self-confidence. Improving your self-confidence may seem difficult, but there are several simple things that you can do, such as using positive self-affirmations, challenging your negative thoughts, and trying new things.\n\nThe book touches on the many aspects of self-efficacy - what it is, what influences it, why it's important and what can we do about it. This book has helped me understand my self in a more intimate way than i ever could. Besides helping you understand how to become more confident about your abilities, the author has written about how to become more disciplined and how to keep working toward your goals without giving up. You get the information you need and can move on to start working on yourself. All in all, a good read."
4	"I'll have a mild spoiler alert below, but I found this story entertaining.  It's an interesting mix of how rights should be applied to artificial intelligences, politics, and modeling.  My particular interest in my on modeling efforts these days in in genetic algorithms which is something the main character attempts on a grander scale.\n\nThe story is well written, although you get little in the way of world building except through some news stories.  There's only one character that's fleshed out to any degree.  All of this is mostly a function of the novella form, but it left me a touch cold.  The world itself obviously exists only to frame the main thrust of the story.  Again, well written, some interesting threads, but a touch 'cool'.\n\nSPOILER ALERT\n\nAs promised, this is relatively mild.  The ending is one which I guessed pretty quickly.  In Novella form it works fine because in a longer novel you might be tempted to feel cheated by the ending.  As it is, there was still something of an inconsistency in the ending, but not enough to take away from the overall effect."

4	'The main character gets a flat tire on the way to her mom s house. While she is trying to get a signal on her cell phone two brothers show up in a tow truck they tow her car to a mechanic in there town. While she is there she agrees to play the goddess  Morgan at there equinox celebration. I liked this book it was well written.'
4	"I liked this book, because the theme of re-united lovers is one of my favorites and there was a lot of introspection and I usually like it. I think the book is very well written and the setting is very interesting. The emotional and sexual tension between the two main characters is constant and I always like when there is a lot of chemistry in the main couple, something animal, like it depends more on pheromones than a personal affinity. There was the right amount of misunderstanding and miscommunication that made the story personal TO me, meaning that I would have liked to have two words with both Tanner and Niall at various moments in the book.\n\nI really liked the trailer park and its people, they are very loyal and focused and in a sense much more organized that the secret service group.\n\nUnfortunately I didn't like the narrator. He seemed flat and subdued. Probably he isn't at his best, there's guilt and a sense of defeat in  him, like nothing interests him anymore. Tanner is one of those characters that feel that the fate of the world depends on their own single actions. Maybe he lacks some self-esteem, I really can't tell. Then I think the secret group where he works wasn't as smart and secret and professional as it should have been. These two things made me roll my eyes a few times and that's the reason of my rating. I will probably re-read it in the future, just to see if it's my mood that's influencing my rating, because it's a very fine story and I have no problem in recommending it to action and suspense lovers."
4	"L.B. Dunbar has done it again.\n\nShes taken MMA fighters, put them together in romance, weaving together a biblical like, fairy-tale style read that once started, sweeps you off your feet. Her words and way with description almost lyrical in nature. Captivating to be sure.\n\nBut she also gives you not so perfect characters. Ones that on a day to day appear to be anything but the fictional entities they are, but more like real everyday people, experiencing much the same things we do, but on a little bit of a grander scale. Heros that even though they make mistakes (and trust me here, Cain made some serious missteps along the way), you still cant help but root for. Want the best for and definitely want to see come out the other end of what plagues them.\n\nIn this case Cain (and Abels) father.\n\nWhat a piece of work that was. I thought Id seen the level of his depravity and lack of feeling as it pertained to his family in Abels story, but let me tell you, the worst is yet to come. There were quite a few instances here where I was just taken aback and completely off guard at just how deep his own hatred of his family went. The sheer need for destruction on all levels that he had. While I have to admit I did think that things were taken to an almost out of this world at one point (hence the rating being lower than Abels), it wasn't so much so that it took away from the overall feel of the story for me.\n\nI still loved it and I still loved Cain and Sofie together.\n\nFor anyone thats read the previous novella, you're aware of how their relationship comes to be and how it ends up heading into this one, but what you get here on a much grander scale is just how affected these two people are by each other. Sure, theyve got the physical attraction, but there are points in this novel, way before any feelings are admitting or I love you is uttered where you see its even more deep seeded than that. You can see that its more and you just want both of them to smarten up so they can see it clearly too.\n\nThese two whenever they were together in scenes were phenomenal. Scorching yet fluid at the same time. It was like all the pieces fit for me. What Sofie was to Cain and really what he was to her. Temptation and Sin at times, but ultimately, change, beauty and happiness. In a way, a soft place to fall for both of them. And considering what they managed to go through within the pages of this story, they were both definitely deserving of that.\n\nOverall, this book delivered on everything I went in hoping it would, even if there were some aspects I didn't enjoy as much as the others and I think that if you're a fan of MMA fighters, falling in love, flawed characters that mess up a few times before they get it right, youll really enjoy this. I know I did."
4	"Under the Hood is a really enjoyable novella that introduces us to mechanic Alice Starr and the all female garage that she is trying to get up and running with her friends, aptly named Under The Hood!\n\nNot all men are lying, cheating bastards.\n\nAlice has been hurt in the past and has a big thing for honesty in all of her relationships, so when she helps her sexy neighbour Mark Jameson out when he appears to be having car trouble, little does she know that he is being less than honest with her when it comes to his own skills Under the Hood\n\nThis is a beautifully written, entertaining novella that introduces us to the girls of Under the Hood Garage. Sallys writing style and the likability of the characters draw you in and keeps you reading until the end. There aren't any real surprises in this book plot-wise, but I liked the uniqueness of the all-female garage concept, and I hope that everyone gets their story as the series progresses.\n\nBeing with someone new was like swimming. It started with dipping toes into the pool, flirting as attraction grew. Swimming in the shallows was refreshing, but held no danger. With one kiss, theyd advanced into water so deep she was in danger of drowning... in deep water, you could dive. Immerse totally in sensation, and luxuriate in the sensation of being one with the elements.\n\nLooking forward to more from this series and this author!\n\nARC provided via Netgalley, in exchange for the above honest review."

Triston is shocked to find Selene pregnant upon his return. Cute story very little drama. Sweet couple.'
2	'I really don\'t see how such low humor has received such generally high ratings.  The one person who left a one-star rating didn\'t even read the first chapter; I read the book(let) through twice to see what I had missed that was so funny and was still not laughing.  Yes, I live in the Bible belt and no, I do not profess to be either Christian or atheist.  Yes, I have encountered my share of "Bible-thumpers" but not any "spiritual bullies" (and besides, if you are an atheist you don\'t really believe in anything "spiritual" do you now, so how can you be "bullied" in that sense?)  Making a mockery of others\' religious beliefs in an anti-religious rant peppered with profanity is a low level of humor, and any premise of victim/bullying here just comes across as irrelevant and irreverent.'
4	"I enjoyed this short story. I liked the premise of dying women being take as mates instead of the usual women with no family storyline. The story moved fast. Jordan is a good heroine. The king could be a little more developed but it's really her story."

3	'The book begins by introducing Jayden. He is the roommate of Violet\'s fiance. They walk in on him and another woman. The fiance tries to hit Violet but Jayden steps in and takes the fiance to the ground. When Jayden takes Violet home, he agrees to be her roommate. Sometime later the fiance goes to the apartment to get Violet back. She doesn\'t want him anymore and he hits her. In an effort to heal her, Jayden and his brothers heal her while transforming her into a bear shifter in the process. They realize she\'s their mate and it progresses from there.\n\nWhat I have just described takes up about 25% of the book, if memory serves me correctly.\n\nOne GIANT negative: I read this book before I read Suddenly Wolf. I am glad that I started that book before writing this review. I see a huge similarity in one scene in particular. One of the men removes the female\'s bra and sees red lines where the bra was digging into her. He says "no more bras", she says "but-" and he interrupts with "no buts". This scene with the same words is in both books. I do not like that.\n\nI like that Violet and Jayden were already building a bond between them. I don\'t like how angry Brandon seemed. The brothers\' father was upset about the relationship. It was expressed a few times but played no role in the plot. I also felt the epilogue was very short; I wanted more. Finally at points it seemed like I wasn\'t reading the first of a series (I may be wrong, is this the first of this series?). Two other women in shifter bear menages were mentioned but they do not appear in the book.\n\nIf you have questions, comment and I will answer. I just wanted to give an idea of the book as this is the first review.'
4	"This book was a good read for me. It implemented new tools in my life that I haven't ever thought of before. The money snowball is brilliant. The reason I gave it four stars is because it pushes people away from credit cards. I have a cash back card that I use for everything including utilities and pay it in full every month. By doing that I have already gotten $140 cash back and haven't spent a dime in interest. Overall a great read."
4	'Jo Barrett has an exceptional writing finese.  She creates a heartwarming tale in this Novella that leaves you wanting more.  Ms. Barrett has written numerous other books in her style of the right amount of romance and substance to keep you turning the pages.  Your time is not wasted in reading what she has written.'
3	"The story is okay but her self esteem just kills it for me ...as a big girl I can't imagine her self image is this dang on low and she really isn't that big and her sex game is supposed to be so good but her self image doesn't match it, I keep reading the books but not because I like the female lead character, I read in spite of her......"

1	"I'm used to reading short stories but this story was very short. I felt like the whole storyline was rushed, the relationship was rushed; everything was just bunched together. There wasn't even a clear description of the characters. The only thing that was clear was that they hated each other and after having sex they wanted each other I would have liked to see a little more character development between the two of them to see the relationship blossom. Overall it was okay read I just like a little more depth to my stories."

4	"If you love the Italian language, D'Annunzio's work always offers something worth reading. Which book you comes across your path first is inconsequential to the point of irrelevance, which is my hopefully polite way of saying they are all pretty much alike. That's why I'm not going to write about just La Gioconda. It's much more fun to comment on his work in general.\nD'Annunzio wrote as a grand French chef of the period before the first World War cooked, without regard to the number or cost of exotic ingredients in his dishes. A Roman princess who bathes in a sterling silver bathtub? Must get cold awfully fast, wouldn't you think? And who has to polish it, anyway? If you grow even slightly familiar with D'Annunziana, though, you'll skip untrammeled over such lavish details\nNevertheless, he dwelt lovingly over every rich detail of the lives of his women characters. I can't resist adding, however, that nothing ever really happens unless some cataclysm is required to finally land the wayward plot like  an exhausted fish on the riverbank.\nThe best story I know about D'Annunzio is this. At the time of the abortive founding of the Republic of Trieste in 1919, he showed up in full uniform. He had been a great if inconsistent war hero, a popular darling, so was much decorated. Showing up in Trieste with all his medal ribbons and marks of rank removed from his uniform would have been like General Petraeus appearing suddenly in jeans and T shirt at your local MacDonalds, but that's exactly what he did.\nAll the other idealistic young Italian officers who had flocked to the unborn republic's cause instantly copied him, requiring the local laundresses to bleach their uniforms in such a way as to emphasize the places from which their own campaign ribbons and marks of rank had been conspicuously removed."

4	'The Prodigal son is one story that I believe to be authentically from the historical Jesus. For me, a once Christian who would no longer consider himself one, I enjoyed reading this book.  I like hearing her Christian logic and how she defends it.  While I may not agree with all that is said here, I do find it comforting.'
4	'All four books in the series of Leigh were lots of fun to read. All her friends were so crazy and lots of laughs and always getting into trouble. When Leigh suddenly becomes a witch because she writes on this old desk and the stories come true, all her troubles really go haywire . I enjoyed the series and will keep the author on my faves list.'
3	"But hey, nothing beats a good conspiracy, right?  If you look long and hard enough, you can find them behind everything we do.  I do think that there's more to 911 than what we've been told.  That being said, how about Lincoln, Kennedy, etc.?"
3	"I got the books for free from a bookbub deal and then liked the book so much I purchased books 1-5 as a set. I blasted through the first four books enjoying them immensely. But about half way through the fifth book, it became a bit too far reaching and the main character started sounding really whiny. The book started to drag as a result and I still haven't finished it."

2	'I didn\'t know what to expect when I first downloaded this book.  Taking a journey with Karrine in this book was actually captivating.  Such raw emotions exposed...so strong yet extremely vulnerable.  The book was well written and will keep you involved from beginning to end.  I can\'t understand how she could give so much of herself to someone, but I\'ve never experienced what she has experienced.  But anyway, this was a great read!\n\nUPDATE: I checked "The Vixen Diaries" out of the library two days ago (May 16, 2013).  I read Chapter 24 and for the life of me can\'t understand how as Ms. Steffans put it "for the next two months (so that\'s January and February 2007)....paraded me around Tampa)is with Antonio Tarver and Lil Wayne (...was late January 2007 when I stepped off the plane and into the city of Miami, Florida for the sole purpose of seeing Wayne for the first time) at the same time.  So what\'s really going on?!? I thought these were real life events...I\'m confused! I know people do what\'s necessary to make money, but why make the reader believe these events are true when they obviously are not. I changed my rating based on this discrepancy.'
4	"A quick glimpse into what is sure to be some really tough times coming for Hayden. It gives us a peek into Chris and Sarah, and hints at things to come for them as well. It was nice to finally get a deeper idea of who Chris is, we've only ever seen him through Hayden and Tenley's eyes."

4	"Rolf Stenstrom and his love of caring for stray cats always aggravated his wife. Grace wasn't a fan of felines. While she was still living, several of the animals met untimely deaths from accidents. During the last year of Grace's life all but three of the cats disappeared.  Eventually, they also vanished. For months Rolf continued to keep a lookout for any cat in need, but none showed up until a month after his wife's death.\n\nOne day a striped feline appeared begging to be fed and Rolf once again began the ritual of caring for a stray animal. In a short time, the cat numbers grew, but even though she was no longer living he honored his wife's request that they remain outside of the house. In the ten years since Grace's death, hundreds of felines arrived at his residence and he fed every one of them.\n\nCatManDo by Jack Ewing is a case study of one man's enormous generosity toward animals and how it took over his life. I found it admirable and somewhat scary that Rolf chose to take on the huge financial and physical burden of taking care of animals that had no owners and interesting that their numbers multiplied to a much larger extent than he ever anticipated. The end of the story proves that some people will even sacrifice their bodies to help animals in need."

4	"I received a free copy of this book from the author in exchange for an honest review. This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of my review.\n\nUnelmoija: The Dreamshifter is the first novel in the Weeia series by Elle Boca. Its a short book, 208 pages, so its a quick read. The basic storyline is that Amy is a dreamshifter who doesnt know much about her ability or her kind, the Weeia. She is approached by a man who gives her shocking news. Then, she meets another man, Duncan, who becomes her friend. Both men help her throughout the book, since someone keeps trying to kill her. I know thats really vague, but Im trying not to give too much away.\n\nThis book is appropriate for young and new adults. The main character is eighteen years old. There is no romance in this book.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed reading the story. I liked the brisk pace and the world-building.\n\nThere were some problems I noted, however. The first thing I noticed was how Amy describes herself using a mirror at the beginning of the book. This is an overused literary device. I think there could have been a better way to let the reader know how she looks. Second, I noticed some spelling and punctuation errors. For example, Sara is sometimes spelled Sarah and sometimes Sara. The third problem I noted was that a lot of the book was spent detailing what was being eaten at every meal. There was too much about food. Fourth, I felt like this wasn't the first book, even though it was. There was a lot of stuff that went on prior to this book starting that I think could have been written first.\n\nThose issues weren't that big of a deal. I still think this is a well-written book that a lot of paranormal/urban fantasy readers would enjoy."
2	'A mix of other recent YA novels. This one does not bring any difference or stand by itself making it just a pleasant reading.'
1	"I love to read, and I'll read almost anything. Rarely do I not finish a book, even if it does not capture my interest. This book, though, is just unreadable. The syntax and wording is so clumsy and stilted that it was impossible to get into the story. At first I thought the story was set in maybe the 1800's, but there are planes and phones, so that is not it. Reading this was like riding standard shift car with someone who doesn't n\nKnow how to use the clutch. Bumping, lurching, bruising - no forward movement at all. The characters are dull and flat. The author tells you things instead of showing things through the characters. Horrible, juvenile writing that would have gotten an 'F' if turned in as an assignment for Introductory English Lit!"
4	'I enjoyed reading this book it was really good to read. I love this series so far it is really good. I love the relationship between Parker and Elliot. I love the twists and turns and the edge of the seat action in this book and this series. I also love the comedy in these books too. I will recommend these books to everybody I know and to all my friends too.'
3	"I got it hoping to get some insight into the game that might not be provided through normal play, but it just wasn't there. The data is concise enough, and it's accurate. But there's not a lot there beyond the basic points. I'm not sure exactly what I was expecting, Candy Crush isn't exactly a deep interactive experience. It's a decent guide if you don't want to poke around the Internet looking for specifics."
4	"This is the second book I read of Lynda's and I have to say that I was not as impressed. Binki's bitterness was a little too much and I didn't understand why William fell in love with her. Also, I think I would have liked knowing what was going on in William's head, rather than being a one-sided story. However, since it ended the way I wanted it to from the beginning, I will be a little forgiving in my review and give it a 4!"
2	"This is my first book by this author and I can tell shes very talented, even though I didn't connect with THIS story. To me, it takes a special kind of author to be able to wrap things up well enough to make you feel satisfied and happy yet make you crave the next book at the same time, and It was not done here!! This is a story about how Sabato growing up, how he managed to survived yet allowed his past to determine his future. Sabato is a young man with a very bad attitude during his teens and college years, which he lash out at everyone because of his past and present situation. He was ruthless and in self-destruction mode, while building so many walls around himself for protection and it made him act like an a**hole majority of the times. Overall, OK read."
4	"I show clemency to him for the total lack of ending. This is a great slice of a great adventur. Poe probably didn't want it to be remembered as a story but a sequence of events."

4	"Good story about a land beneath the sea.  Chey - Chevrolet - lives under the sea, but chafes at the rules of the Authority.  She learns about the Surface and dreams of it.  Similar to Disney's Little Mermaid - it was an interesting paradox.  I hope there will be a sequel, because this book felt like it ended rather abruptly."
3	"A little bloated; overrated classic. Characters boring,but reflect the self-absorbsion of the '20s.\nWorth the effort, if only to grow one's perception of the pre-depression U. S."
4	'I really enjoy books by Lauren Blakely she writes a very entertaining story that keeps you from wanting to put the book down!  I just wished I would have read this before Mr. O since Harper the heroine in Mr O is the sister of Spencer in this book.  I would recommend this book!'

1	'I was just going to let this one go but after reading the review of LadyLoves2Read, I had to give another side to this story.  First of all, the heroine shows up at her house in the woods wanting to hide out from the press because Hollywood booted her out of a big part for being too old and too heavy.  Of course, we know in Hollywood she could have been 6\' and weigh 100 lbs. and she would be overweight, but no matter.  She is running and so she shows up at her house in the woods to find that her cousin rented it to his friend.  NOW the cousin did call her and tell her she had a renter and he probably gave her all the details but she was so wrapped up in  herself and her big career that she paid no attention to what he was saying, agreed with everything and hung up to get him off the phone.  So, not knowing was ON HER.\n\nThen she proceeds to try to sweet talk him into getting out and giving her the house.  DIDN\'T bother to try and understand why he was there or even cared, again Miss I am So Important To The World didn\'t care what his reasons were she wanted her house NOW and wanted him gone.  Good for him that he refused her.  I have no idea what happened when they were 17, but if it still bothered him, then it was a BIG deal. l think this heroine was a selfish self-centered "hole", NOT HIM.  She continues to try to make his life miserable so he will be forced to leave.  I was at 13% and I hated this witch.  I skipped forward to Chapter 3 and she was still acting like a jerk.  Skipped to Chapter 7 and still a jerk.  I decided to read the reviews to see if she got on anyone else\'s nerves when I read the 1 star review and the reviewer thought HE was in the wrong.  I couldn\'t sit still for that. I wish I could have told him he could have got rid of her in a day---just call the press and tell them where she was!  they would have come running and she would be on the road again!!  Too bad he didn\'t think of that.\n\nI usually love Ms. Alvarez\'s books, I have 5 but this one just didn\'t do it for me.  I couldn\'t stand this heroine from the very first.  Perhaps her character will grow and she will see that the world doesn\'t revolve around her but frankly I don\'t care enough about her to hope she improves.  Her personality just got on my last nerve.  If she had used just a part of her energy trying to find an alternate solution to her HIDING need, she would have been a much more agreeable character.  Frankly, I don\'t see her changing much and since I didn\'t like her in Chapter one, I don\'t think I will like her any better at the end.  People with that kind of personality don\'t change, they are who they choose to be.\n\nThe setting in NZ is always a favorite of mine.  I loved the hero.  He had a lot going for him.  He had his issues he was trying to deal with.  I wish this could have been better for me.  I love the NZ authors and their storylines but this one just didn\'t do it for me.\n\nI was not paid for this review.  I am not an author nor do I know one.  I am not kin to this writer.  I am a reader and this is my opinion, nothing more, nothing less.  10/29/17'
3	'Easy to read, good tips'
1	'I started with chapter 1, Atari 2600, and stopped a few screens in.  It was not proofread or sense checked when "ET was rushed and proved to be an satisfactory videogame: sales were so low that rumours surfaced of a million cartridge units being buried in a landfill in the Nevada desert."  Sounds like those sales were very satisfactory to me.  And about that desert - one of the most pervasive myths in early gaming is that ET killed the console industry in the US and that the cartridges were buried in the New Mexico desert, not the Nevada desert.  They actually dug the cartridges up last year near Alamogordo, New Mexico.  The publisher didn\'t know that when it published the book 4 years ago, but the myth was so widely known and popular that someone felt they had to try and confirm it.  The book may be better with the European systems, but I don\'t have high hopes if they can\'t perform simple proofreading and fact checking for one of the most iconic and researched systems in gaming history.'
3	"This book is written like a movie script, and in fact would have been better off written as such as opposed to a novel. The first few chapters were disorienting, and it was not until a third way through the book where things started to come together. One of my biggest pet peeve's occurred in this book, and that was the constant jumping between characters point of views. There are 12 heroes in this story, and they all start of uniquely individual and towards the end becomes a unit. However, on a single page one could end up reading from 3 to 4 different POV's, giving me whiplash as I didn't know who to focus on.  After reading the book, I still can't tell you the names of all 12 heroes, nor what their back grounds are, or their skills and why I should even care about them. I recognize the intent that the authors wanted them to feel like a unit towards the end, but in my opinion the effort fell flat on its face. Also, the content of this book is not for the faint of heart. If you are easily offended by someone imagining and interpreting what the end times would look like, as it relates specifically to Christianity, then I would not recommend you reading this book. However, if you take it at face value as someone imagining what the end times could be like, with a grain of salt then you'll probably enjoy the story. All though I slugged through this book, there were a hand full of endearing moments, and the final message of you can't do everything by yourself and so you must be willing to ask for help from above, is an endearing lesson.  As for family friendliness, I would probably not allow younger children to read this, who are stilling learning about faith and the truth, but it may make some great discussion points for young adults. Regardless, this is one of those books that I would encourage parents to read themselves before allowing their child to read."
4	"This book is a great background reference for all the characters in the coming books. I liked the way you get a bit of everyones story so you don't feel like you're missing anything. Everyone has their demons and works to overcome them. Each person works things out in a different way. Great book, don't skip it, read it!!"
4	'Having been raised in Puerto Rico for the first 22 years of my life, and growing up in a bi-lingual home, this book presents what I feel is the last window of opportunity for the Puerto Rican people to rescue paradise lost.\n\nOne characteristic of the Puerto Rican psyche is the continual movement towards the easy way out, to depend on welfare in order to just get by.\n\nA recent article written by a newspaper columnist examines the addition of the Puerto Rican worker to government programs and easy money. The sobering facts describe the reality where it is better not to work and get welfare than to struggle and make the same or less money under the minimum wage.\n\nPuerto Rico has an amazing potential in becoming a Tourist haven, but unless the people understand that an economy based on tax incentives only creates fiscal deficits, rising crime and rampant unemployment.\n\nEl Manual de Rescate Economico presents in very concise form a set of guidelines and concrete plans to transform Puerto Rico from the anemic state of affairs into a Caribbean Tourism and Entertainment powerhouse.\n\nWell written and backed up by factual references and statistics, this book may be the last hope for Puerto Rico as it faces an uncertain future in a Globalized economy.'
3	'This story of the Aztecs and their neighbors makes for an interesting venture into what could have been. This was well presented and well written.'
1	'This is a basic introduction that describes different sales scenarios and the pros and cons associated with them--such as cold calls, warm calls, email and the like. Despite the intriguing title, it explained absolutely nothing about closing any type of sale. A disappointing read.'
4	'It kept my attention and I wanted to read all three.'
2	'It was a bit too simple for what I needed but I found it easy to read and filled with bits of trivia about dangerous animals.  Please correct mistakes, for instance, Malaria is not a virus.  Nice photos of dangerous species.'
4	'I think they are really dumb, but it got my son who hates reading to actually read so I am happy.'
4	'Aaron signs up on shifter dating website where he is matched with Emma. The story is cute with a HEA ending.'
1	"I played this game for like 5 levels and gave up for lack of inthusiasm to go any farther.. I'm just glad that I did not pay money for it.."
4	'Great information but  it did not explain how to price your products.'
4	'Very very sweet book.  Both are struggling  against past issues and trying to overcome their  fears  while building  a life.  Love the plot.  Sweet romantic  book'
4	"~3.5 stars~\n\nThis made for a pleasant fairytale retelling of Beauty and the Beast.  The story was pretty predictable throughout but I still liked it.  The writing style was solid and the characters relatable.  I also appreciate that it was offered as a kindleunlimited.  I'll definitely check out more of this writers work."
4	'Lovely short story and will read again.'
1	'Unfortunately was having a brain cloud when requested this book.  Did not notice it was only the first 7 chapters; will wait until I can afford purchasing the entire book [very difficult when living on limited income-will need to wait several months to a year].  When I have read the book, I am sure my reviews will be three cheers as the Preston/Child team never seem to fail my reading enjoyment.'
1	"This book at best is only a hyped up Short story. Don't waste your time and money!\nBuy another  book by  different author."
3	'Nothing to write home about...very contrived but I wanted to know what happened...now I do...so not much else to say.'
4	'Good book, well documented'
4	'This book was pretty light and definitely enjoyable. It had some hotness and was pretty funny at times. I liked that it was stand alone with HEA. I also love a book with an epilogue.'
4	'Easy, intriguing read'
4	"I really liked this book.  I thought it was a great romance novel.  Sometimes it made me feel all fuzzy inside and sometimes it made me want to throw my kindle at the wall.  I would recommend this book.\nThe only reason I didn't give this book five stars is, I just felt like something was missing.  And the main characters kind of annoyed me at times.  I don't know if I would read this book again or not, but I did enjoy it."
4	"Good story, I just didn't feel much connection between the two main characters. Great storyline but just didn't feel anything."
1	'I was very disappointed in the content of this book.  No really solutions or actions were given.'

2	'*Contains spoilers*\n\nI\'m still reeling  from the book, and not in a good way. All that pain and suffering and that\'s it? I felt like the "hero" should have been begging for forgiveness way sooner than in the end. I\'m also not entirely convinced of the HEA. It\'s just a bit sad that a woman has to literally plead and beg for the guy to just accept her love over and over again. And he just denies it and cruelly throws it back in her face. Repeatedly.  I mean, sometimes you have to maintain SOME pride, straighten up that spine, and call it a day.  Make THEM come after you because you are worth it. She finally did near the end but it was a short victory as she caved pretty easily IMO.\n\nThe plot itself wasn\'t something new but I really expected more. It centers on a guy (stubborn fool) who\'s been hurt in the past so he feels the need to dole out punishment on a innocent woman.  And how lovely it is that our heroine, Maddie is simply one of the most selfless, purest, kindest heart I\'ve had the fortune (or misfortune) of reading.  Does a woman like this really exist? I don\'t know whether to commend her on having the patience of a saint or shake some self-respect into her. I mean I heard of doormats, but willing doormats? She acknowledges how desperate  and pathetic is it to keep returning to Caleb even when he hurts and rejects her time and time again. But I suppose unrequited love does make you blind. The girl was just DETERMINED to heal his heart no matter the consequences or the nasty barbs he flings at her. I couldn\'t understand how any woman could put herself through being insulted, demeaned, basically treated like crap, before and during the pregnancy. The virginity thing for example. She gifted him her v-card (heavens know why) and he pretty much freaked out and made her felt cheap by leaving right after the act. It was so heart-wrenching in a nauseating way...I couldn\'t help but cringed in pity for her. That a person is willing to endure so much hostility and heartache just so they can bring some light to a dark and tortured soul. One who chooses to remain that way. Quite honestly, I don\'t think the guy is worth all that hell and anguish he put her through.  But hey, this is her dream guy she\'s loved since her teen so that\'s good enough for her. For me, it\'s just puzzling how one simple act of comfort from a decade ago (in which he didn\'t even remember her) equates it to being her duty to SAVE him. And put up with his verbal abuse and horrible attitude throughout the book. *shrugs*\n\nAnd as for poor, poor jaded Caleb. There\'s defense mechanism and then there\'s outright cruelty. I don\'t think it was fair for him to take out the sins of other women on the heroine to an extent where my blood was boiling. I find the guy just intolerable, lacks emotional maturity and is so DAMN mean. Guys like him really pisses me off.  Am I supposed to feel sympathy for a guy who got screwed over by a few ex\'s so he feels the needs to condemn and punish all women instead? But mainly the sadly naive girl who is clearly a masochist. Take it out on the real culprit, buddy, not a clueless lovesick girl.  I\'ve read of other heroes who been so horribly scarred from their past, women, etc. but they still treated the heroines better than Caleb did Maddie.  It was just so unwarranted as Maddie really had no ulterior motive, aside from just wanting to fix his battered heart. If it were me, I\'d give him tough love and knock some sense into his surly and bitter ass. Get over yourself and your bruised ego, stop hurting the wrong woman. But instead, he proceeds to behave like a jack-ass nearly  90% into the book. After she pops out his kid he miraculously see the errors of his way, apologizes for his callous behavior, and confessed his love too.  I only wish it hadn\'t taken the birth of his child for him to reach that epiphany. And that long for him to finally expressed his regret and shame for treating her so poorly throughout the book. Maddie on the other hand, is only too happy to accept his apologies. She\'s joyful and relieved she finally broke down his walls and won his heart. At last, she got the guy she\'s crushed on since high school. Too bad it came at the expense of her dignity, health and nearly decimated heart. Gah, the guy didn\'t have to work for it, everything was pretty much forgiven and brushed under the rug. Like in a nanosecond.  Me, I\'d at least make him squirm and sweat it out a bit for putting her through such an ordeal.'
4	"This wasn't able really fun book with great characters with just the right amount of adventure, excitement. You will laugh along with the characters."
4	'These are light reading and fun.'
4	"OMG...I don't know where to start I'm a mess at the moment. This story was amazing, but so heartbreaking.\n\nFirst reading I thought about how I'm gonna complain about some of Dash and Tabatha's stupid and useless actions and decisions. Waist of precious time. But after finishing reading I don't have it in me to complain at all. I don't feel like they deserve it. They where just lucky people who even for a short time find love to be gifted and enjoy it.\n\nFor making me ugly cry 4 stars."
3	"I'm a huge fan of America's Test Kitchen and the approach of this book.  That said, unlike their other cookbooks this one is very limited.  The book spends a great deal detailing the benefits of pressure cooking but doesn't show much by way of recipes.  The Posole recipe is delicious and the methods they've devised are fantastic for electronic pressure cookers.  I just wished they had applied as much ferver to this cookbook as they have with Slow Cooker Revolution and How Can it Be Gluten Free books which are essentially bibles on the subject matter.\n\nThis IS the book to get someone if you are buying them a pressure cooker.  At the very least it will give them great tips on best practices.  Unfortunately not enough recipes."
4	'I simply paged thru this to try and see if it would be helpful for someone else.  It was informative.'
4	'If you know nothing when it comes to survival, this book will help you get started in the basics.  I think the information here should be common knowledge for anyone who spends a fair amount of time outside.'
3	'I chose this rating because I did not gather much info from the book.\nIt Winthrop me as much as I should have understood.'
2	'What was with the first and last name thing? It was very distracting for me and made it difficult to read the story. I also think the relationship with Travis and Morgan developed way to quickly. They meet one day and the next they are already thinking about long term relationships with each other, even though they eventually decided to wait.'
4	'Wow, this book was so engaging and really hard to put down. Willow was just the character I wanted to read about. She was sarcastic and quirky and made this book more interesting. I especially liked her and Jonathan. They had this chemistry with each other that was swoon worthy at times.\n\nSue McMillin did a great job creating a unique storyline that really captured my interest'
3	'The story was cute, light-hearted, totally decent, and I did laugh out loud once. The characters were likeable. But it was all too easy. There really was no conflict, no suspense. The only thing that held my interest was that I kept waiting for it to get interesting. The humor was mostly one-line insults, and mostly aimed at one neighbor. Also, there were some lines that would be repeated from time to time like inside jokes that were supposed to be funny to the people involved. I think the author wanted to make a point about decent romantic relationships, and she succeeded at that, but it needed some plot twists, or maybe it just needed some plot. I hope she continues to write and takes more time for plot development. This book was free, but I was not interested in spending money on the rest of the series. I must mention that I mainly read history and biographies, with an occasional light and decent romance. Maybe someone else would like this more than I did.'
1	"What a horrible book! Right from the beginning, it was just AWFUL. I didn't even get a third  of the way through before deleting it from my  Kindle. Pure garbage!"
4	"Since I've started reading books about space this author caught my attention from the beginning. This author keeps you enthralled through out the whole series. I also like reading about the old characters in the new books. I hope she keeps on continuing in the same way of writing her series. I really dislike when author's change it up so drastically that it loses it's appeal. Keep it up Vi. Love your work."
1	'S.M Harkness needs to find a new profession !! This book was very poorly written small examples would be the continued repeating of "the DIA agent " I got that he was a DIA agent in the first paragraph ! The story line was completely not believable ...with one example having one of the terrorist able to assassinate the head of Hamas with no security present ?? Also the constant reminder of the writers politicly loathing towards liberals is annoying and completely unnecessary from any writer !'
3	'I enjoyed earlier books by Christy Reece, this one was ok but not as good as the earlier ones.  I could not understand  the conflict between H and h , it seemed contrived and unnecessary. As for the ending, it was just flat, all the earlier drama/mystery over who could have set them up, and then that was it!'
4	'I received this book for free in exchange for an honest review.  I found the book sweet, fun but a little standard.  It had its moments but felt a little rushed at the end.  The writing was done well and the characters were not one dimensional.  I would recommend this book to others if you want a fun quick read.'
4	"Unsatisfying ending to a enjoying short read (SPOILERS!!!!) This book was good but the ending was cut and I felt as if there was so many questions unanswered like what happens when Collin and his sister comes out to their family? What happens after they kidnap Bud Wallice and his wife and that creepy lawyer guy? To many unanswered questions the ending was so abrupt! Hope the next book in the series clears up some things....because I honestly feel a little bit of a let down with this book...still it wasn't so bad Charlie Richards is an awesome writer and I'm a big fan and have faith that she knows what she's doing  and I can't wait to read the next book !"
1	"I.....don't even know where to go with this. The punishment dynamic didn't bother me, like other reviewers, but the grammar did. The story was also all. over. the place. There was some blue flame action going on that was never really explained and the drama was over the top. Seriously, how many times do bad guys just randomly appear shooting? A serious editing job needs to happen here. Then, there were times when the dom violated the sub's limits, without discussion. That's never okay. Can we also talk about the whole grand poobah of bdsm thing? Really? No."
3	'Overall I liked the book, the author is very creative with the span of time, AIs, different worlds and aliens.  Writing style is kind of bland but that is common with newer authors.  Definitely worth the 0.99 money.'
1	"I could not for the life of me get into this book. It was very slow for me and IDK but it bothered me the fact that a 16 year old was with a 22 year old. That's too much. I couldn't even finish this book"
4	"I enjoyed it but it still seems like the the ending isn't finish. Story got a bit weaker as it was coming to an end."
4	"Good story with exciting fun and surprises. Quick read you won't want to put down. Looking forward to reading the next in this series!"
3	'Having previously read, enjoyed, and re-read Fifty Shades of Grey (and I freely admit to this without any shame or embarrassment), I was intrigued by the premis of a girl being kidnapped and then sold into sex slavery. However, despite the intriguing premis, this book hit it off on the wrong tone with me from the get go. I wanted to love this book so much, but there were so many issues with it that at times I found myself skimming half of the chapter just to make it past it.\n\nThe narration did not resonate with me and completely pissed me off at times. This was mainly due to the concept of "being broken" and "breaking", which Tess continuously brings up and refers back to as a narrator. This painted Tess as an unreliable, contradictory narrator and broke the flow in the story, moving it from effortlessly to choppy.\n\nYou want dirty, filthy, dark smut? You\'ve got it! We\'re talking some serious dark stuff here! I\'m all for some sexy times, when the time is right and the plot, characters or readers require it. But the sexual scene were so many, so condensed and so long that it took away from the plot and replaced what should\'ve been scenes giving away for character development. Also, I\'ll have to admit that the sexual scenes teeter on the wrong side of the dark edge for me. Others may enjoy them tremendously, but they were not for me.\n\nI cannot look past the fact that I lacked some serious character development. I realize that this is only the first in a series of four books, all following the same main characters, which allows room for character growth, but that does not justify having an entire novel go by without much happening in terms of the character\'s development.\n\nNow, with all of that being said, believe it or not, I did not find this book horrible, but actually rather enjoyed (most) parts of it. From the moment I picked it up I was interested in seeing how the premise would uphold and the story unfold, and it was definitely intriguing to follow along in. I completely acknowledge that I don\'t understand the dynamics of Q and Tess\' relationship, or why anyone would chase that sort of dysfunctionality, nor do I condone the actions of the characters. Ideally this rating would be a 2.5 - it was okay, but I did not find myself obsessing over it or wanting to dive back into it immediately for other reasons than seeing how the author would round off the plot. To the author\'s credit, she did allow the story to come full circle, by having Q release Tess from her captivity.\n\nI have no intentions of picking up the sequel to this book.\n\nPlease be advised of trigger warnings for nonconsensual sex and sexual encounters, slavery, violence and other similar topics. Please be advised and do your own research before picking up this book.'
1	'Poorly written young adult/pre teen drama. Pretty cover though.'

4	'Not exactly what I needed but this book does have some neat ideas of fun things to do. So over all it was ok.'
4	"My Review:\nOn the surface this is a hockey book...and it definitely has lots of hockey in it. But it's so much more than that. Both the hero and the heroine are musicians...with all the depth and emotion and artistic aura that comes with that and I LOVED that aspect of the story!\n\nAnd that's why the meeting of these two works so well. Jacqui is in her senior year of college at the age of 25. She also works in the local music store which is where she meets Henrik, although she isn't aware of who he is when that meeting happened. I love that she isn't a hockey fan, although she grew up in a huge family of hockey fans, and hockey is a part of her family's life through the season. That's what happens when you have 4 older brothers and a father in MN, right?\n\nI love how unsettled Henrick is. The author pointed out from the very beginning. He isn't happy with his life, can't stand to be home alone, hates not having a girl to fill the space. The reasons why aren't immediately apparent, although it becomes pretty obvious that it ties to the grand piano in his house that he hasn't touched in ten years.\n\nThere's a lot of emotional density in this story...both for Henriq and for Jacqui, and I loved that about it, even if it was one of the detractors for the story-telling. This seriously could have been a book that left me in tears several times, but the author didn't *quite* step up to the emotional potential the book had. And don't get me wrong...it was in no way or form a bad book. In fact, it was on the cusp of being phenomenal. I'm just sad it didn't quite reach that point.\n\nBut as it is...the book is fabulous. I loved Henrik and his character development over the course of the book. He literally comes alive because of the things that Jacqui opens up to him. I loved all of Jacqui's brothers and would love to see some future books featuring them, especially Aidan. I definitely enjoyed the music aspect and the fact that Jacqui takes charge (although I would have loved a session with them and Hawke & Vanessa.) I do love a woman who will take charge of a big, tough, alpha male in the bedroom.\n\nI continue to enjoy this series. Lynda Aicher continues to be one of my auto-buy authors for good reason!\n\nI received a complimentary copy of this book in return for an honest review."
2	"I didn't like that it ended before it should have, I'm sure it's a hook to take you to Book 2 but I won't go there."
3	'It left you wanting the story to be finished. It was like only reading a book sample. Now I know that it is only a short but still could have ended better than the way it did.'
4	"Another great read by D.G. Whiskey.  Really liked these characters.  James, the bad boy you can't help but feel sorry for."
4	'In this book Paige tries to get her baby daddy to love her.  Due to his upbringing he feels love is impossible.  There are many interesting twists and turns to the plot which lead to a happy ending.'
1	"Wasn't very good I lost interest quickly in reading this not steamy enough. I wouldn't recommend this for erotica readers"
4	"Everything I Need is the second book in the Everything I Want Series.  The first book is Everything I Want which starts out the journey of a crazy love story between Tristan and Sophia.  This book definitely has just as much steam and hotness as the first book.  Natalie Barnes most definitly knows her hard rock metal.. I am not a fan of that type of music but I will still a huge fan of this series so far.. yes I said so far this book ends in a bit of a cliffy as well and some are going to scream at there kindles like me and some are going to say how sweet!  This book will pick up a little ways after the first book ended.\n\nTristan is drowning himself in boose and drugs just to forget about Sophia.. but when he is told his European tour is called off and he needs to go find himself he doesn't think it will help but he goes back home...\n\nSophia's heart is broken but she knows she has to move on with her life.. her band is starting to get noticed and she needs it a distraction from thinking about Tristan....\n\n2 years past and Tristan finally finds himself put together and starting to work on his music again.. when a project of sorts is brought to his attention to do a duet with a female lead he is reluctant to get started.. but when he finds out that the duet will be with Sophia he thinks he finally found a way to get back into heart and not her black list...\n\nSophia's band is about to go on there tour but is asked to do a project with a fellow member of her recording studio's team.. she is excited at first because who wouldn't want to do a duet with another popular rock star.. when finds out it is Tristan her wind will blow out of her sail...\n\nHe hasn't moved on but she has.. can they find there way back to eachother?

4	'This was a very good scary short story with a neat comic that it Is told in tweets I liked it. I got it cause I just finished NOS4A2 which you should also get.'
2	"John Sadlers Osprey title on Flodden is better than this book not to mention Sadler's monograph on Flooded, full of insights and details. This one is too shallow. While Reeses book is ok, you will not have adequate understanding of the battle of Flodden if you read only this book."
4	"This was Jennifer Julie Miller's first novel... and I think it was amazing.  I loved all of Eden's story: how she came to meet her water skippers... and how she met Kyle.  I loved the progression of Eden and Kyle's relationship... and how the little water skippers kept track of Kyle's actions.\n\nIt's been a while since I'd read a story that involved such a sweet bit of magical fantasy.  I'd forgotten how much I love the idea of magic being in the world around us.  I look forward to future books from Miller, and I hope she keeps her sense of fantasy in her writing."
1	'I did not enjoy this book at all. I actually stopped reading it. It made me very uneasy.'
3	"Okay I'm guess the rating are friends and family. No way am I giving this book 5 it seemed rushed, no skills to speak of the plot was mediocre. I will say this did read smoothly even if I didn't like nothing but the hype of the character class that literally went nowhere book was supposed to read like out like we would play an actual mmo yet it fell on that part, firstly the character and the world was not thought out well in my opinion. Example the sword saint skills were basic and plain the leveling and really no grinding or farming, I was hoping for a raid or two with someone being the tank while being backed up by a ranger with a cleric chanting or bard singing his life away and we had none of what we are use to reading or playing. This book reminded me of super nes rpg straight to the point linear pathway."
4	"This provides so much information on kinesiology taping and teaches you so much.\n\nMy family plays sports and sometimes gets injured so we have purchased some KT tape and started using some of the taping techniques.\n\nThe book teaches you which technique to use for your injuries. So give it a try, you won't be disappointed.\nThis guide was provided at free for my honest review of this product."
4	'I thought it was really good!! It became more of a crime story than a spanking romance novel.'
3	"I love this series so far.  The story is great and it's easy to become emotionally attached to the characters. I so badly want to give this a higher rating but the writing needs a lot of work.  To Denise, you have a beautiful mind and I encourage you to keep doing what you're doing BUT, we are not all perfect at everything. The books need editing.  In many occasions a word is left out, an extra word is added, words are misspelled, punctuation is incorrect, and there are issues in which past and present tenses of words are off.  It greatly takes away from the book. I beg you, please spend the money on a professional editor for the sake of your own career because you could do great things. Hell, this would even make for a good movie."
4	"The author certainly kept me on my toes throughout.  Lots of twists and turns.  Characters were well developed.  Celeste is a grad student who sleeps with her professor before she knows he is her professor.  James is a rich alpha male who happens to be a professor at Celeste's university.  They both go round and round with each other multiple times.  Plus others interfere as well.  Hence, all the twists and turns.  There were a few times when I wanted to slap Celeste around for being so indecisive.  James has the patience of a saint and the type of romantic at heart that every girl wants to fall in love with.\n\nThis is a stand alone but does not have an HEA."
4	'The story was very enjoyable and well thought out.  There are some grammatical errors which at times gets confusing, but otherwise a good read.'
3	"This book has had me confused about how to rate it. On one hand, this is a good MC story that has the angst, grit, violence, suspense, wild parties, and great sex that your typical MC books have, which is fine. I like these types of books and love MC stories. On the other hand, it started out with Maddy writing her story, at the advice of her counselor, about her dealings with the Hero and the love of her life, Ford, and the MC that he belongs to. That would have been ok, except when you get Ford's POV's included in this story. Obviously he's not writing about his story, and it's fair to say that Maddy can't write his thoughts and feelings regarding their story when she can barely keep her's straight and sane most of the time. Had the author presented this as them both just telling their stories, it would have been a lot less confusing and made for a better book. There were some errors in the editing, but not enough to take away from the story. I'm hoping that the next book will be layed out better and have a smoother flow. If so, it should be a good one."

4	'Great character building, good characters, lots of action and intrigue! Thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, have read others by Mr. Pettit but first with Casey Ward bad Mr. Pettit. Hats off gentleman good story!'
2	"Ok the writing isn't terrible but seriously like 5 pages in these people who have never met are confessing there undying love for each other like really? This book is really corney and lame the bad part is that it could've been okay possibly with some major changes and if the book was more than 20 minutes long the author writes well I wouldn't mind reading an actual story from them instead of one attempted to be wrapped up in one chapter"
4	'It was a good read'
4	'Wow-! This was a lot of fun, and has the "honor" of being the first  Kindle book I\'ve taken the time to review-despite owning many hundreds of titles.\nA great mix of intrigue,excitement and a combination of "earthy" humor and quick-witted "wise-cracks" between characters.\nAs an ex-teacher, I know young people of all ages would be delighted---& there\'s much to enjoy even for us of the "more experienced" persuasion-!!'

3	"* * * 1/2 stars\n\nHow freaking adorable is this cover? Seriously, that's what drew me to this series in the first place. And I'm thrilled to say London Falling is even better than its predecessor with the addition of Samirs point of view making it a more rounded and engaging story. Where I See London was brimming throughout with sexual tension, London Falling has that combined with trepidation about what the future holds for each of them. I'll try to avoid any spoilery so here goes ...\n\nAfter a heated ending, Maggie and Samir spend the summer apart and it's complete radio silence between them. When they return back to school neither knows what to expect. So they're both jittery and awkward around each other. How their friends haven't picked up on this, I have no idea. But when it comes out that Samirs future is spoken for by his parents and that theres no place in it for Maggie, her heart is broken and hes a wreck.\n\nMy favourite aspect of London Falling is coming to know Samir as more than the international playboy were used to. Hes a guy with the burden of his familys legacy looming over him. His unaffectionate father has high expectations of him to return to his side in Lebanon.  He has no tolerance for any of Samir's shenanigans or his indulgences. Knowing this makes you realize that Samir has been taking a very slow march toward kissing his freedom goodbye.\n\nLondon Falling also highlights further the disparities between them such as their cultural differences and familial obligations which are laid out plainly before them. Maggie doesn't want to destroy his brilliant future and Samir doesn't want to lead her down this path that she can't accompany him on. These two are simply too afraid to be honest with each other about their feelings or about what they truly want for themselves. They play a very uneasy game by deciding to live in a fantasy for the next few months at school until Samir graduates and has to return to his family. Someone is undoubtedly going to get hurt once their bubble has to burst. Its unavoidable but they're both big kids and they know what they're entering into.\n\nThere are quite a few sweet surprises in London Falling that are well, bittersweet. Moments where youll smile and go aww and others where youll just feel sad because it'll make their goodbyes that much harder. Nevertheless, its a wonderful sequel with plenty of sizzling scenes as well as emotional ones. The only thing that could make this better? If Ms. Cleeton would be so kind as to give us a follow up with life moving forward from Samirs point of view. I truly believe theres a genuinely compelling story right there. Read London Falling and you'll understand what I'm on about!"

3	"3.5 stars\n\nWhen I read the synopsis, I was interested in this story and knew that this would be something that I would like.\n\nGuy and Jules have each suffered through life-changing traumatic events. While both are still hurting, they each handle these tragedies in their own way. Jules is broken inside but does her best to keep moving while Guy holds bitterness and anger. When Guys son Finn lands in the hospital and is entrusted in Juless care, their first meeting was not a pleasant one. Guy comes off rude and mean and Jules did not like that one bit. She gives him it to him straight and becomes annoyed. However when they meet again, they get off on a nicer foot. Guy becomes intrigued and a relationship starts to develop between the two. Will they be able to heal each other? Or will this end badly?\n\nThough the story was good, I felt that too much was happening. Guy and Jules could not catch a break. It seemed like it was one thing after another. I really felt sad for them. I just wanted everything to be alright and for them to be happy. After everything they both have been through, I didn't want them suffer more. However, this is a testament to the authors and their writing-that they could make me feel so much for these characters. But still for me, it was little much. I did like reading about their tragedies and how it has shaped them to be the person they currently are. I also like how Guy and Jules started to mend their brokenness when they were together. They deserved that happiness. I also loved the interaction that Guy and Jules had with Guys children, Finn and Max. Those two children are simply the best. The unwavering love they gave out was too sweet. Guy was such a doting father and I loved seeing the protectiveness he had over them. His life was his children and it was shown through the book. It made up for his rudeness in the beginning. Jules became part of the family and it was wonderful to see the love and care shown there. She became just as protective and doting. These were my favorite parts of the story. I had a smile on my face while reading these scenes-just so beautiful.\n\nThough there was a lot of drama, I still did enjoy this story and would recommend it to others. The characters and the writing are great. This was a nice read about love, family, and the power of healing from both."
4	'I use this book mainly as a reference.  So far it has been good.'
3	"The designs in this book are NICE, but having to do Screen captures of designs I'd like to use for Tattoo flash or to rework makes it less appealing, Books like this should allow saving or direct printing of designs. I'd have rated higher if not for this foible."
2	'Strange sounding recipes. Lots of errors.'

4	'Pleasant reading before settling down to sleep. I enjoy Debbie Macomber.'
3	'Not really long enough to get into it but I love revisiting the characters.'
1	'Started as a sexy romance then morphed into a creepy tale of violent and degrading sexual violence.  Another female author trying to convince women to accept physical abuse and torture from men.  Characters were inconsistent and immature, with the emotional level of middle school bullies.  Huge disappointment!'
2	"My error in ordering this book- it wasn't what I enjoy reading.  Again my mistake not the author"
4	'Enjoyed the characters and the little twist at the end'
2	"I initially thought this game was great but the clues started repeating after about twenty games.  I guess ten cents a game isn't bad...just keep new releases coming."
1	"The book was OK tell the ending I will not give away how it ended but the ending is so bad I'll probably never read this author  again the way was written pretty much voided the last three books made me go what's the point of all these books with ending"
4	'Very fun, even though YA is not my favorite novel. I will likely even read more from the series. Recommended to all fantasy fans. Good, positive fun.'
4	'Great book for a first timers. I recommend it to others wanting to burn off some fat and detox the liver at the same time.'
2	"The book was good it kept you enthralled throughout, imaging all the possible outcomes  just to be left hanging at the end. I'm glad it was free or I'd be thoroughly pist."
1	'This book is trash from top to to bottom.  Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito had no involvement in the murder of Meredith Kercher.  Many American experts have studied the case and they are breathing fire. The whole saga was little more than a medieval witch trial.  This was in fact a tragic but very simple crime. Meredith Kercher was murdered by a local thug named Rudy Guede.\n\nThe experts who have condemned the trial and police investigation include three retired FBI agents, an American Judge, four CBS documentaries, a Pulitzer Prize winning NY Times journalist and many other respected writers.  One of the FBI agents, John Douglas, is probably America\'s leading expert on homicide investigations. The judge, Michael Heavey, described the proceedings as "a witch trial being prosecuted by a delusional prosecutor."  And this is just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nRudy Guede denies every having met Raffaele Sollecito and contrary to what the tabloids like to claim he never made any accusation in court regarding Amanda or Raffaele.\n\nNick Van Der Leek represents himself as an expert on crime.  The fact is that no crime in history equates to what the prosecution and the author allege.  Female participation in sexually motivated homicides is extremely rare and when it is found it invariably involves male manipulation and a woman who is an empty shell.  The female ring leader scenario that he describes has never once happened in the  history of crime, not once. Nick Van Der Leek just picked up on it for the same reasons that the British tabloids did.  It makes a story that might sell.  Truth be dammed.\n\nThe following quotes from the book are ridiculous and probably defamatory:\n\n"Merediths rage has turned to misery. She begins to cry, and Amanda, both enervated by her victory and alarmed, begins taunting Meredith."\n\nYou just don\'t like that Im getting more than you are. Youre jealous. Youre a stuck up jealous bitch. Do you want some? Do you even know what you want? Im not the one whos not going to be living here anymore. Im going to make you eat your words. Im going to make sure you choke on them!\n\n"Amanda is not thinking straight. She is drunk on coke and marijuana. Adrenalin and fear have alchemised this brew into an even deadlier cocktail. She has no idea what to do, but shes playing leader to two schmucks. So she runs with it. She draws out the torture over half an hour. Meredith aggression alternates with terror. She begs Amanda to let her go. To stop."\n\nBut thats the problem. Youre always telling me what I can and cant do, Amandas words are slurred, shes so high. Stop playing guitar, clean the bathroom. But guess whos in charge now?\n\nRudy glances at Amandas piercing blue eyes. Sharp as razors. Haha, I can see its been a while since Rudys gotten laid. You guys were You guys were MADE for each other. Go on Rudy, give Mez a kiss.\n\nThe above is all nonsense.  No DNA or other physical evidence was found of Amanda Knox in the murder room. It did not happen period. Rudy Guede claims his sexual contact with Meredith was consensual and that somebody came in and killed her while he sat on the toilette. A few hours later he is dancing at a disco; the next day he flees to Germany. The wounds to his hands are he claims from his struggle with the real attacker. In the weeks prior to the crime his life had been in a downward spiral. With no visible source of income, he had been involved in a series of break-ins that bore striking similarities to what was found at the crime scene.  In one incident he entered through a window and threatened the resident with a knife when confronted. That\'s right he threatened somebody with a knife inside their own home.  Couldn\'t possibly have been him. Must have been the pretty roommate bossing him around.\n\nPlease also note that the positive reviews written above immediately after the release of the "book" were probably written by the author or his cohorts. The quotes above can also be found in another Kindle edition the author had put out a few days ago called "Doubt."  You can\'t find it now because it was removed due to complaints about plagiarized content.'
4	'Sandra Brown has done it again, as usual. Fun, entertaining, holds your attention. What more can be said she is great'
4	'This is a good book for beginners. It is a little simple, rather short, but covers all the bases.'
4	'Good read. Characters and plot keep you turning the pages and there is suspense all the way to the end.'
4	'I was given the ARC for an honest review.  I am not usually very good at writing these things however I like to think I am honest.  I knew this book was going to be a novella in a series. The Prologue was undeniably  hot.  Going into Chapter one,  I see that the author was "setting the stage" for the rest of the series.  The only reason I give this a 4 Star instead of the 5 is because I would have liked to seen a little less of the character saying over and over that she is broke.  I understand that, most college students are.  Otherwise,  I am a huge fan of cliffhangers and I really liked how there is one.  I am going to purchase book 2 to continue on with the story.'
4	'Overall, a good short read.  The mistaken identity is a little predictable but it certainly adds a fun element to the story. Keeps the readers engaged until the very end, excited to read the 2part of the series.'
3	'This book was helpful, but could have been a little more detailed as far as how to get started in this business and ideas for gift baskets. There were a lot of typos as well, which I find unprofessional.'
3	'All fun books which make pleasant reading.'
4	'Nyx is pretty sure fate has made a mistake but he gives in to the inevitable and claims his pixie only things are much worse than he thought because Pol harbors a dark secret that could put Nyx at odds with the King in this captivating m/m paranormal fantasy romance. The story is fun and full of passion with charming characters and interesting elements that kept me captivated until the very end and I am looking forward to reading Chaos story since I am pretty sure he will be up to something. The story can be read as a stand-alone but I think its better if you read them in sequence for better understanding of the characters and their world.\n\nSee my full review at: The Romance Reviews .com'

4	'Good but not enough'
4	"I enjoyed the characters and the storyline of this novella. I would look for other books from this author. It's a good quick read."
3	"A bit unbiblical regarding how Enoch does his miracles.  God's miracles do not occur naturally like the eclipse but supernaturally like the resurrection of the dead."
4	'Very good story line and interesting characters. I liked this book enough to order and read the 2nd in the series. I recommend giving this book and this author a chance.'
1	'This is more like an article. should have been priced at .99 cent but not worth that either. Lacks enough valuable content.'
2	'"Yes it is, actually. Knowing everyone\'s little secrets is a means of gaining leverage over them and I never pass up an opportunity for that."\n\nWhile I was slightly disappointed with how quickly this novella moved from solving to solved. I still was able to enjoy it and really liked Drucilla\'s character. I think I would have even been able to like Celeste\'s character had we gotten to know her more. I did figure out who the killer was fairly early on in the book which was rather disappointing.\n\nI kind of wish this book had been made into a full length novel and not just a novella.'
3	'A naive reactionary idealism based on what was seen during the birth pangs of government created and organized by a populace i.e., nation, which had never been seen before and the natural subsequent difficulties of such a political experiment in its beginnings as permanent conditions that would require revolutionary action to set it aright. The first part is little more than an emotional rant. The communist manifesto is completely untenable and unrealistic in any practical form. This is evinced since the advent of communism in Russia through every country that touts the communist ideal. This utopian idea, as Marx states himself, can only exist at the behest of a bourgeois already in existence and well developed that a proletariat might be created so that the communist philosophy may become necessary and thereby implemented. The society Marx outlines is devoid of any boundaries, towns, cities, provinces, states, counties, countries, and political parties. From its thrust into the world in Russia throughout every communist country currently in existence, not a single one of them reflects the philosophy and ideology of Marx\'s communism. All communist regimes are just as much a prime example of class distinction and class antagonism, albeit minus the "right" to publicly take any position not in line with the ruling communist class. Marx\'s philosophy directly opposes not only industrialization but also the advent and continued proliferation of a mechanized world. It is also a philosophy lacking any sense of values and character indemnified by Marx\'s open declaration that communists will ride on the back of any revolutionary movement they view as having the probability of overthrowing the ruling class of any nation regardless of that revolutionary movement\'s philosophy.\n\nAfter reading this the naivety of Marx and his fellow communists of his era, the progenitors of the communist philosophy, it becomes abundantly obvious that power hungry, greedy men of unbounded avarice would see the communist philosophy as a means to their ends with the window of opportunity presently afforded them at the time. These men then used the guise of communist utopia to rally men to their cause, the poorer the better, to agitate them towards violence and ride the wave of revolution to victory and the establishment of yet another government that does not also create class distinction and oppression but brutally does so. Once these men are in power the result is similar to a monarchy without the opulence. Not only all power is invested in the ruling class but also so is all the national wealth held by the ruling class, just like it is in a monarchy.\nBoundaries are not erased in any sense but are more firmly established and enforced even at the cost of death for anyone who would try to escape such a blissful existence.\n\nThe representative government authorized by a constitution is not, as no construct of men may not be, without its problems. Still, a government defined by the people of a nation, restricted by a constitution, and built upon inherent rights belonging to every human being, is far better than anything else the world had in the past or currently exercises.'
1	'This book corrected all my technique issues and explained exactly what the differences between the two products are.  By spending the money on this item, I was able to support someone with equal ability to my own to type the question into Google.  That feels good.'
1	"This is a total waste of money. Most of the book is self hype as the author promotes his other items for sale. I found this to be completely useless. There's a reason it's self published."
3	"This book is OK.  It met my expectations, as I wanted only a short overview of Churchill's life, nothing more. Since this is the first book I read on this subject, I cannot say how it compares with other books."
2	'good story ruined by grammatical errors, incorrect word usage and character mixups.'
4	'Short, but good'

4	'I enjoyed the storyline and found it fun and interesting.  Would recommend it and would read more from the author.'
4	'Hernan was quite a guy. A history not told often in the US.'
4	"The biggest problem I have with short stories is that they're, well, short. This short story could definitely be turned into a full-fledged novel. I enjoyed reading it, but got to the end and was disappointed that it was over when it was just getting started."
4	'Yea...girls win!!!'
1	'The author does not know Roman culture.  She consistently misuses Roman names and titles of address and appears to have no understanding of Roman family life. A cultural advisor knowledgable in Roman daily life would serve her well and greatly enhance the appeal of her books. She seems to think that Romans should behave like 21st century Europeans.  She takes the old adage of "The British Upper Class in togas" a step further. Also, her grip on English grammar and usage could be considerably improved. I do not recommend her works.'
3	"This book is ready short, I wouldn't even consider it a book more like an essay.  The writing is funny but not not great"
4	"This book was a welcomed slowdown from books 1 and 2. I do love Show almost as much as I love Isaac, but I did not connect to Shannon like I did Lilli, so I look forward to reading future books to see a glimpse into how their relationship progresses....maybe I will come to love Shannon too. I didn't dislike her, I just didn't come to love her like I did Lilli. And her secret wasn't all that terrible to me.\n\nIt was great learning more about Showdown though, and I am so glad he did find Shannon to help him come back to life. That man had suffered more through the years than anyone should. His family was very important to him, so how things went down in book 2, just crushed him. Like another reviewer...I totally understand Holly's need to get away but I didn't understand her not coming around to her senses sooner about their girls getting to see their dad. Show loves those girls, and to lose so much would kill anyone. He did what he needed to survive and to read his story was very rough at times. When he went into Daisy's room....I just cried and cried.\n\nEven though this book was not as action packed as the others, it is no less vital to this series. It is the continued journey of these characters and the healing for Show, the Horde, Isaac, Lilli, little Ms. Gia, and Shannon. It is definitely a beautiful continuation to an awesome series!!"

4	"3.5 Cocktails\n\nAfter three days and nights of passion two solstices ago, Avery told Hunter she can only offer him friendship. Avery has been hurt in the past and despite her feelings for Hunter, she is not willing to open herself up to him. Hunter needs Avery by his side and in his bed every night until forever. Hunter knows Avery is his mate and won't let anything distract him from his goal: Averys heart. Can Hunter convince Avery to take a chance on love, or will he be forever trapped in the friend zone?\n\nWhile I am a fan of Selena Blakes Stormy Weather series, Im not really a fan of this read. I hadnt read the previous books in this series so that may have affected my opinion of the story. I felt a little lost at times not having the background on the characters, but that was my fault for not reading the other books first. The sex scenes were very steamy and the plot was interesting, but I had a difficult time connecting with the main characters. Avery was wishy washy in her wants and Hunter was steadfast in his pursuit of Avery but I didn't feel any chemistry between the two. Although I didn't enjoy the book as much as Id liked to, I still support the author and her work.\n\nReviewed by Elizabeth for Cocktails and Books"
4	'Bought this for my son.  He loved it'
3	"Was shocked and sadden by the tragic ending to this book.  After finishing this part 1, I was seriously considering not reading part 2 because what would be the point of continuing without Aden in Amber's life."
2	'Did not like this book and thought the author tried to push his products to much.'
4	"A New Hope is the second book in the Second Chance Series by Christina Escue. It will be released on March 28th. I had the privilege of reading this book very recently and I have to say, I like the story line to it and while we see the characters as more like children in the first book, you can definitely tell that they have grown up some in this book since many of them are facing challenges that have went from being accepted when they were younger to now having the challenges of deep relationships and whether to have sex or not since they are so young. This is a clean book so it does not condone teenage sex or anything and I like the outlook that the adoptive dad, Andrew, has on this issue in particular. Andrew tells his daughter's boyfriend, Connor, that he doesn't really approve of it but still wants them to be safe and that Connor can talk to him about whatever should he need to. This book has a few different stories in it though, the most prominent being the appearance of Karla, the adoptive daughter, welcoming her brother, Elliot into the family. After his grandmother dies, he comes to live with Karla and her family. It is a tough adjustment for him. He has dyslexia and has a really hard time reading. It shows his struggles in and out of school. My favorite though has to be the chemistry between Manuel and Callie. Manuel is Karla's brother and Callie is Connor's twin sister. The two of them have a kind of chemistry between them that is there from the moment Manuel shows up in the story, but he irks Callie to no end and she doesn't know what to do with her feelings. This is a good read! One definitely to check out when it is released!"

1	'Much of this "ebook" is low quality scans which cannot be re-sized, or searched and the kanji is all but illegible. Forget about text to speech.

4	"Yes, I am in highschool and was required to read this book for my American Literature course, but I enjoyed reading it. It takes a lot to keep me entertained when it comes to reading and I'm not saying this is the most exciting book in the world but I for some reason I wanted to keep reading it.\n\nThe style of writing is good and easy to follow and relate to.\n\nAs for the story line, I liked it over all but like most books I wasn't completly satisfied. I thought that the author could have gone a little more in depth with each character. There is a good amount of symbolism in the story though so it's good if you want something to think about.\n\nI know it seems like I am putting the novel down but actually I do recomend reading it. I think you will really enjoy it."
4	'The jokes in this book were hilarious and kept me laughing! However, there were a few mistakes. First, a few jokes were repeated; but there were extra jokes at the end so that you still get your 247! Secondly, I was a bit bothered by the grammar mistakes, mostly capitalization.\nDespite the issues, this is the best joke book I have ever read, and I recommend it for all ages. The jokes are clean and often punny.\n6-106 recommended'

1	"Way too many typos. Not enjoying this book at all and I'm not a fan of romance I just bought it cause it was free and seemed interesting."
1	"I am appalled at the ratings this book is getting. The book is boring, terribly so, and the writing style is similar to that of a child, but somehow worse. You wonder how by the third chapter the female lead is thinking she's in love after 1 date and some submissive sex. The story does not flow properly, the grammatical errors are plenty. I never leave reviews and only did to warn those who are used to well read stories, that sequence properly, minimal grammatical errors - this is NOT for you. If you pay 99 cents, you'll get 99 cents quality. Even after reading my own review I have no adequately explained what I dislike about the book, it was just THAT bad."
3	'Unfortunately the author has penned one of the most detestable heroines ever. By the end of an otherwise very creative story of the apocalypse I was hoping the heroine would be killed. She was a whiney, spoiled child who\'s only redeeming trait was her knife work. Me, me, me seemed to be her only true mantra. She continually endangers her cohorts and seems to have nothing in the way of conscience. I will pass on the remainder of this series as it is all about "Bixby."'
3	"Our heroine has just been thrown out of her living arrangement with her boyfriend/lover/etc.  Now, according to her, she was responsible for doing his laundry, cleaning the house, preparing the meals, buying the groceries, cleaning the floors, plus having sex on demand.  It sounds to me a lot like the life of a housewife.  She had the job without the benefits or security of joint ownership. She also had a demanding job and was desperate to hang on to it while others around her were losing their jobs due to the bad economy.\n\nSo, that is her lot in life.  She doesn't want anyone at work to know the sad state of her affairs.  Her big client, Mr. Silver, son and heir to the Silver millions/pounds, is her only hope of drumming up more business and making her job more secure.  She is an ad exec. at an advertising firm.  Mr. Silver seems to slip through her fingers at every opportunity.  This girl got on my last nerve.\n\nThings are not looking too good since she is going to have to get in a swimsuit and take swim lessons at his swim club.  The one account that she holds the advertising rights to.  She almost drown as a child, bad experience, so she is terrified of the water.  Her boss has insisted that she take the lessons.  She is having nothing but bad vibes.  So she gets the tub of ice cream and eats half of that then decides to get a bottle of wine and drink until she is drunk.  Of course, she still weeps over the loss of the loser.  It is like losing a dog that poops on your carpet and then bites you when you try to pet it.  Did she really think that was as good as it gets?  I got bored with her and quit reading.  This one just didn't do it for me.  Just my opinion, read it for yourself.  You might enjoy it and find her situation funny.  The other reviewers seemed to like it, so it is probably just me.  I'd give it a chance and then decide if you like it or not."
3	'If you remember the \'60\'s TV show "12-O\'Clock High" this book has all the excitement, action and plot of the most average of that series. The plot revolves around Capt DUST,whos life was snuffed out after landing on Feather Duster\'s  24th mission.  "Feather Duster" is a B-17 whose crew only has one more mission until they can go back home. A 19 year old Sergeant Rosenberg (Rosie) was assigned to be the bombers Ball Turret Gunner for the 25th mission and find out the circumstances involved in Capt. Dust\'s death  Before the final mission Rosie has several uniqe experiences, among which is a British Wing Commander wife\'s rump, a branding iron,a naked "trot through the base, being shot at by MPs, being shot at by members of his crew, being shot at by Germans and generally hated by all.  During the final mission events happen that only Wile E. and the Roadrunner could appreciate.\nIt was worth what I paid for it.  It wasn\'t a BAD READ, it was just so predictable.'
2	"Maybe if I were utterly bored I would read this but only then. Just didn't hold my interest enough to even dip in and out from time to time."
3	"That's not to say I didn't laugh out loud on a few occasions. If you enjoy travel stories, then you'll like this."
3	'Short but still funny and would recamend for a very very very very very very very very short read and I mean very.'
3	'Read it for its historical value. Many of the problems of the prolteriat still exist. Of course it completely Ignores human Nature when unlimited power is in the hands a very few men. Marx and Engals misjudged human nature.'
1	'I loved the book itself but this chapter compilation which I bought by mistake was a major disappointment.  It was poorly written, often inaccurate and gave none of the flavor of the complete book.'
2	'Really not that awesome'
3	"I loved the protagonists in this book. They are strong well established characters. The plot was ok and has a few nice little twists to it.\nMy main issue was the tremendous amount of detail that just dragged the writing. And the repetition of certain elements over and over again. It bugs me when authors do this, almost like they think their readers are slow on the intake and don't get the information the first and second time it is present. I think an editor could have gone over this book a couple more times and it would have flowed in a much smoother manner.\n\nAll in all of you want a great warm romance with protagonists you can fall in love with, this is a fine one to fulfil that need.\nEnjoy."
1	"Disappointing, but what I've learned to expect from this faux conservative! This book is little more than a compilation of her articles, lacks any cohesive message, except her continued attacks of real conservatives like Newt Gingrich. Amazed that anyone would still bother to read, or care about, anything she writes!"
1	"The whole book is confusing and hard to follow.  There are better books for solving the puzzle.  The best is the simple solution to Rubik's Cube by James Nourse. Just saying."
3	'"The Holy Grail" by K.T. Tomb is an adventure novel about an Australian writer, Cash Cassidy,  gathering background information about the Holy Grail, the cup of Christ.  She moves from peril to peril, sometimes extracting herself by uncertain means.  As with other Grail seekers (Indiana Jones) she encounters cults bent on maintaining the Grail\'s location a secret.  While on this heroic adventure she spends considerable time on her cell phone trying to resurrect her failing marriage to a jerk in San Francisco.  The jerk repents, the novel is a best seller, and all is sweetness and light.  I am glad this book wasn\'t expensive.'
1	"I wanted to read how she learned different techniques and how she managed fishing with her husband; instead she complained about clothes and how she felt about bad weather. Don't wast your time."
1	"Because basically the entire story consists of one week, two heavy petting scenes, one sex scene, and then it's together forever amen. Even by romance novel standards that's pretty weak."
3	'This was a good refreshing read, but quite predictable in many places, as well as rushed in other areas.'
2	'weak by Grisham standards.'
3	"So, I was hoping this would be as good as the first. I didn't feel like it was. I wanted to slap Tatum. She is an idiot."
3	'The book was just ok to me I am starting book two'
3	"When two people can't communicate their feelings for each other they need  something to give them a push. Several\ndifferent  things happen in a short period of time to  bring them\ntogether."
3	"The novel begins with one incident and then moves forward to another time all together.  It is hard to follow at first and has a bit of drag trying to piece all of the situations together.  There are several areas where you can get hung up on all of these other details and it is a bit confusing.  Once the book picks up it reads pretty well though.  The main character is likable, but she also isn't one of those strong characters readers enjoy to follow.\n\nI received this book free in the #RHMysteryPack from Chatterbox by HouseParty in exchange for my honest review."
3	'Some interesting information. If you are new to dieting, you will gain a lot of helpful hints and useful information.'
3	'Summary: DADA--Data, Analysis, Decision, Action.\nAlso explained why US went to war with Iraq. A quick read in one night.'
1	"I played this game on Kindle touch and found it difficult to move the pieces around. I won't waste too much time on this one."
1	"Very superficial and borrrring. I expected it to be about the depth of bonds between survivors and the strength of women's wisdom. It just fell flat, a few sugars does not a Texan make."
2	'I have read several of her books. this one just dragged on and on. Her characters seemed flat and whiny. Love her other books'
2	'Overall, I was not very impressed with this book at all. I usually don\'t buy an anthology unless I am familiar with more than one writer, so I took a chance on this one because the only writer included it that I am familiar with was Alexia Purdy and some of the other writers sounded promising. Sad to say, her story was the only one I liked. The other stories were pretty much a "meh, I\'ve read better" type of work, and there were 2 particular ones that stood out to me as being the worse of the whole bunch. One was St. Charles at Dusk by Sarah M. Cradit...I personally do not like the jumping around of first person to third person on top of jumping back and forth on a timeline. Too confusing at times. The second one I did not care for was the novella In Too Deep by Morgan Jane Mitchell. Ugh. I don\'t even know where to begin on that particular one at all, and I\'ve read some humdingers in this genre before, but this one takes the cake in stretching the limits on credibility at times. Normally I love reading anthologies, I have found so many new authors by finding them that way. This is NOT one I can claim to have found a new one in, and this is not one I would recommend. I removed it from my Fire.'
1	"Not a huge fan of this, I spent more time flipping pages than reading actual content.\nIf you've heard of Facebook Twitter blogs etc... And realize you should actively use them to engage your audience then you've read this book. Needs some actual methodologies and statistics that are useful when choosing which social media is right for you"
2	"Doesn't always show latest, has a lot of sports news on the home screen, I usually have to go elsewhere for more up to date news."
3	'Good love story with just enough wild west action thrown in for good measure. As expected-true love prevailed in the end.'
2	"If I could, I'd give this 2 1/2 stars.  I dropped the rating to 2 to counteract some of the obvious fake 5 star reviews.  The plot is interesting but has some issues.  The main character appears to have the nine lives of a cat as he miraculously squirms out of one fatal situation after another.  The violence is graphic and I often skipped paragraphs with the gory details.  As per usual with ebooks, there were editing problems."
3	'City of Screams: ending was contrived and not fullfilling.  Could have used more depth. Probably ok for a rip-off short story to promote a new novel.'
2	"This was not the book for me.  I couldn't even make through to the end."
3	"I received this book for free and sometimes you get what you pay for but this book was a page turner. I loved and can't wait to read more!"
3	'I downloaded this book because I enjoy westerns and because the title included "Silver City" (I grew up in that area).  In my opinion, it is a solid, well written story. While in no way detracting from the story, I would note for the author\'s consideration that the distance and terrain between Silver City and Snow Lake would make it unlikely, if not impossible, for a man on horseback to make the trip in a day. On the strength of this book and the writer\'s New Mexico background, I downloaded several more of his books. I haven\'t yet read them all, but those I have, I found to be well written and enjoyable.'
1	'DNF 40%\n\nI am always the girl in the minority. Why? I just don\'t seem to like any of the well-loved books that everyone else does - or I love the book that everyone despises like The Brokenhearted. One day I\'ll get it right... but today isn\'t that day.\n\nLost & Found was recommended to me by Connie at Dillons - the supervisor of the book shop where I did my work experience a couple of months ago. It was one of the most best-selling books of the week and I was the one that designed the window display for it. Connie couldn\'t stop talking about this book, recommending it over and over again. I just don\'t understand why...\n\nThis book is weird. I don\'t mean its like a Roald Dahl book, I mean more like a David Almond weird. There writing style was practically verse but not quite. The sentences were short. The metaphors weird and abstract. The writing was just like Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close - another book that was so "weird" that I couldn\'t get into it.\n\n I really regret that I wasn\'t able to adore this book like so many other people have but it just wasn\'t for me. I don\'t cope with this style of writing and I was struggling far too much to be able to enjoy it.\n\nNote: a copy was provided courtesy of Brooke Davis and Dutton/Penguin Group, through Edelweiss, in exchange for an honest review. No compensation was given or taken during this process.'
1	'If you are seeking erotica about aging couples pretending the is your book. It was childish and silly. The attempt at\nclever chatter was just that chatter. Sad!'
3	"It's busy, unrealistic and at times a bit confusing.  But it's a amusing read. It wasn't a waste of time BUT I wasn't really impressed. Plot felt generic and stiff. A little to forced."
1	'could not get into this book'
2	"I read #7 and loved it. It was hilarious and, I thought, well written. I said in the review that I'd be her fan forever. I ran right out and got #8. It's been 3 weeks, and I've read 41%. I usually read about 2 books a week. I've officially given up on it.\n\nIt doesn't make much sense to me. A 14 year old neighbor comes to play with her 7 year old son. She is told by his grandmother that he is very slow, but he uses 3 syllable words later on. She invites her 14 year old daughter's former best friend to a sleepover her daughter is having, and the girl leaves crying. No mother of a teenage daughter is going to do that.\n\nAnd worst of all, it's not funny. Sorry to mislead you, readers."
2	"It started out very cute and funny but then it just got weird. It didn't leave me obsessing. Makes me wonder if the author actually knows the meaning of the word."
3	'a short and sweet read about loss and love.  other stories embedded in this one short that are worth reading.'
1	'Predicable. Cookie cutter plot.'
1	'Very disappointing book, basicially a research paper and a badly written one at that. Turn to other authors if you plan to enjoy your read!'
1	"There was no plot development or character development really. The book felt really rushed and all of a sudden at the end you find things out about the main male character that your like wait what when did that happen. I don't recommend this book to anyone."
2	"The story began well but without a suitable transition to chapter 2, I felt as though I'd jumped to another book accidentally. With totally different characters and setting I was lost."
1	"Honestly I hated thisx book didn't even finish it when I read as romance I want it to be about masn and woman not two men sucking each other sorry  a Hugh disasppointment some may like this but I am not one of them I have the whole series on both but I think this was my last ."
2	"Sorry but the charts in this book, which are an essential part of learning economics (can you imagine an isoquant without a graph?) do not work. It's hard to believe, but all charts are replaced by a white box with a big red x in the middle of them."
3	'Story depended upon the two main characters. They needed more personal development and antagonistic suspense before resolution.'
1	'Good plot, really bad writing. It was distracting all the grammar errors and the extremely fast pace of the story. Though I was interested in the developing of the storyline, it was done so fast that I would feel left with more questions than answers.'
1	'?? How much flour is in one packet? What is whole purpose flour?  Whole wheat or all purpose white?\nI did not find anything particularly different nor healthy about these recipes.  Sorry.'
2	"This novel is, unfortunately, bogged down with an unbelievable plot. .\n\nIt was not advertised as a religious novel that I am aware of, so am at a loss to understand why some of the readers were shocked by the content. I was only shocked by the lack of research into the life and times depicted. The most glaring example of this is the inclusion of a motel in the 1800s. Motels didn't come into being until the 1950s if I remember rightly. Some of the terms used would certainly not have been current at the time in which this story is set.\n\nThese drawbacks are unfortunate, given the time and effort it takes to write any novel of any genre and the author is to be commended to having completed her manuscript."
3	'I like La hermandad, but is a little confusing with the history in both ages'
2	"I've read other books by this author that I thought were okay... But I truly struggled to get through this one. There were points in the book that were so boring I couldn't even bear to read it. It took way to long for these characters to figure out what they wanted and the ending is obvious from the beginning. Personally, I'd recommend 'in this moment' by this author instead."
3	'Not what I had expected. A good book but I was looking for a little different type of quotes to use.'
2	'Disappointed to say the least. no support images'
2	"This was a very thin story about a Vampire and a werewolf who are supposed to mate to save their species against demons but who magically fall in love two seconds after they meet - and on a side note they take out the demons. Boring one-domensional characters, a plot that didn't make sense and and poorly written love scenes."
2	"Easy read.... didn't love it at the start. A bit dramatic and not very real. Liked it better than I thought in the end!"
2	'I\'ve tried to use Kindle books, but they bore me. My home library is filled with hard-bound and paperback books which I use a lot. I can gloss in them, put masking tape "bookmarks" in them for fast fact-finding, and I can compare their pages quickly and efficiently by leaving several of them open at the same time for a quick visual scan.\n\nThis book was free, but I got the same results again.\n\nI\'m only buying hardbound and paperbacks from now on.  I\'m sure it\'s a nice book, it\'s the format that bores me.'
3	"This is the first book in the emperor's edge series where I question the speed at which the author has written the texts.  In some ways, the plot lines have demurred into a less and less believable steampunk fantasy that sheds the pace of earlier works and, in some ways, has become more forceful with the characters.  Hardcore fans of the series will find the same lovable and flawed characters, but may take umbrage at the way that some character flaws virtually bludgeon the pages.  The subtlety of the way the personalities evolved in earlier novels is gone.  As the reader gets deeper into the novel, the time spent on setup for later events outweighs the pace of the narrative, and such density may lead less interested readers to frustration.  The cliffhanger of this book's narrative termination also raises the question whether the rush to print rather than releasing a single text was the right choice.  In this reader's opinion, I have grave doubts, having now also read the second part."
3	"Ever been searching for a book that is a thriller with a rock star love story? No? Well you should. This is a book that will keep you on your toes, guessing for what is going to happen next. When you learn of Lexi's story, of what she survived, your heart will break. Your stomach will drop to the ground. But, she is a survivor. Then she meets Noah, and your love story ensues. Not only will you fall in love with Noah, but you will also fall in love with the other characters as well. Especially the Troublesome Trio. They are the type of characters that have you sitting back and laughing at their antics, imagining that is what you are going to be like when you are older... well, me at least. This book really is a thriller wrapped in a love story. I was afraid this wasn't going to flow well. I shouldn't have worried. It will keep you sucked into the story til the very end wondering what is going to happen. I loved all the characters in the box, not just Lexi and Noah. All of the supporting characters were great. I can't say I was too happy about the prospect of there being another book, but I'm intrigued where it goes from here. Nate and Lexi's relationship seemed to be missing a little something for me. I don't know, but it just felt like something was missing. They needed a little more depth. But it really was a good read, and totally not what I was expecting. The turns the story takes from the thriller aspect kept me turning the pages wondering how it was going to unfold."
2	'Boring information. Writer is inexperienced. Did not enjoy the book. Was not detailed enough. Should pay more attention to difficult clients instead of writing books.'
2	'Kinda boring'
3	'Decently fast read and interesting concept. The main issues were the lack of editing and how short this "novella" was. Not even sure it can be categorized as a novella. There were lots of typos and the internal dialog of the MC was really repetitive, which was sad bc I really think the story has promise.'
3	"Augusta Price wants nothing more than to be in the spotlight, but it seems she has left her best years, during which she was a big soap star loved by the UK audience, behind her and people just aren't interested anymore. Augusta keeps making mistakes and ruining everything, mainly because after several stints in rehab she still can't control her drinking problem. When her memoir unexpectedly becomes a big hit, Augusta wants to use that fame to get back on top. But when she discovers her ex-lover is about to release his own story, Augusta knows she has to do something to stop him. She hires journalist Frances who has just been fired to help her write another book, while deciding they are going to California to confront Augusta's ex, and perhaps some other things from her past, once and for all.\n\n'Based On a True Story' is quite a quick read with about 320 pages, and also quite an original read. Author Elizabeth Renzetti definitely has her own voice which suits this kind of story well. The book focuses mainly on fading actress Augusta Price and how she tries to get back into the spotlight. I personally had some real difficulty warming to Augusta. She's a complex character; on the one hand it was really easy to dislike her (she's selfish, a true addict, rude), but on the other hand I did find myself rooting for her and wanting her to succeed and find some form of happiness. I did really like Frances, the journalist whom Augusta hires, and I would have loved to have read more about her background and character.\n\nI was fascinated by the story and definitely wanted to finish it, curious to see what would happen. However, quite a few aspects of the novel remain unresolved. Of course this provides the reader with the chance to fill in some of the blanks by themselves, but it did bother me a bit in this case. 'Based On a True Story' is basically a tale about two different women who find each other at a point in their lives when they have hit a low and need to try and pick themselves up again. It's a witty, quick, and unique read with characters that will stay with me for some time to come (either in a good or bad way). It wasn't entirely my read, but I did enjoy it in a way, and I'm sure other readers will as well."
2	'The players in this mystery are more roundly developed than usual, giving the overall plot a bit ore fullness. A nice, light read.'
3	'Full disclosure:  I got this book when it was on the free list.  As I was riding the bus to work, I started reading this short ebook.  Initially, after a few grammatical mistakes, I started to develop a negative opinion.  As I read more, I actually found the book enjoyable.  Even though not a lawyer, the author does summarize some of the relevant legal points and provide some useful tips to avoid a lawsuit.  Overall, I do like this ebook, but is it worth paying for when the same information is available online for free?  If you want to go the free route, I recommend going to the following web site (www.nso.com) and looking though the risk management section.  There is a lot of useful information there.'
2	"Book was REALLY slow.  Good characters wasted.  Sam always locked away. No help from she is a real loser can't figure anything out. Right up to the end. Still don't have a clue how it's all fixed and everyone happy. Skipped a lot just to Finnish the book."
3	"On the good side, one character was trying to help restore the faith of another and change and healing came when they trusted God. On the disappointment side was the large age difference, the rapid attraction when they were practically strangers, the expressed hope that someone who maybe was destined for hell wouldn't be sent there because God is too loving (not what the Bible says, could have expressed compassion for that pain differently) and then that the baby they wanted is getting half raised by a nanny so she can work full time. It had the general happy ending, though, even with healing in other relationships in the story, and I like those."
3	'This book has an interesting premise and is written well. I didn\'t struggle through it by any means but wasn\'t quite hooked enough to want to continue to follow the story of "The One Rises."'
3	"Hard book to rate.  Good storyline and good character depth.  I really enjoyed the read until Hollick's character went thru a change for the worse.  I realize it's fiction, but going from hero to villian over dinner is a stretch.  I've always thought the government indulges in criminal activity when cornered, but the actions of the FBI and CIA in this novel go way beyond belief even for fiction."
1	'Should have been made clear this is a Spanish language book.  Not clear how to delete this from my ipad'
3	'This is a great microeconomics book. It has everything I would expect a 2nd year undergraduate to master. However, the book is neither advanced in terms of math nor  a treatise in terms of its coverage of the subject. Nonetheless, if you need a solid introduction to microeconomics, this book must definitively be part of your collection.'
2	'Far fetched storyline'
3	"The story seems rushed to, and I don't see any growth in the main character as the others do. The main character seems to go through life as a sad person getting blamed by the ones she respects. The author Bookworm book is almost the same characters as this book. One friend that's a virgin one that is a whore and the main character the snow white complex everyone picking on her and she always feel sorry for herself she is playing with gun and nukes and wondering could she do any of the things that she is doing. The self doubt is thick through most of this and others of his books. I read this in one sitting and was happy I got it on kindle I would not have wanted to pay full price for this. The supporting cast are not that supportive they seen like someone pointing a gun at a target then blaming the gun for shooting. The author talks way too much about the abusive parent it has been six books can she either get over it and move on or can her friends stop watching her go over a cliff just to say that was a bad idea. She even said that in the book come on this felt like a filler book that the author through in before he went to the necromancer lair. Hopefully the next book will not have a pity party and a shaming party, Her mentor leaves when thing go to hell in a hand basket they sent her to spy in the last book knowing she is not ready and never gives her any information. She doesn't trust anyone with her magic discoveries yet she is giving guns and cannons to the poor?"
2	"Didn't really keep mu interest, never finished the series"
3	'The book is a nice tribute to Tesla, and a short read. It is actually an intro for the reader to look into a longer, purchased book. It was fun to read and I did learn a few things about Tesla.'
2	'In the introduction it is stated "Amish cuisine is known for its simplicity and the quality of its nutrition". Thumbing through the recipes I did not see much evidence of nutrition. The Blueberry Almond Bars call for 2 cups of sugar and 2 cups of blueberry jam. Some recipes use margarine, breads are made with white flour. The recipe for Cherry Pie calls for 2 cups sugar and 1 can cherry pie filling and the directions say "Coat a pan with cooking spray" giving no indication of the pan size to use (and it is not a traditional pie). I did not see anything I want to make, I just removed the book from my Kindle.'
3	'Of all the Friessen brother books, I liked this one the least.  Neil makes Christian Grey seem submissive compared to his controlling and then acting like a spoiled baby when things don\'t go as he "planned."  Lorhainne should have written a chapter where Brad, Jed, and Andy kicked his butt.  If there is a continuation of this story, as there has been of the others, he has to really change and decide he loves her as she is or the title will be The Divorce.'
1	'Disappointing. Controls are a pain, others are much better (Picture Cross, Picture Perfect Puzzles). Not worth the money since I never play it.'
3	'An interesting eye view on life in the southern states touching upon societal norms of the time, emerging feminism and a need for identity for women and  underlying racial segregation. A good read.'
1	'This series has totally deteriorated for me. It was bad enough when it was three guys now it is like the whole freaking male population.\nThen, you add in all the new characters and new species and this series is a jumble mess in my opinion.'
3	'Nice collection of news but hard to follow (e.g. not categorized) and some specials letters are missing from the words (e.g. the ones describing the photos). Else, it is among the only eng sources you can get in Prague ...'
3	'This story was a great length for an evening read, and the sexy scene was enjoyable. I may read more from the series, but the grammar errors and typos were a bit distracting.'
3	'M. Taylor Hamilton is a woman who knows what she wants: success. She has worked hard overcoming her childhood and is on course to make her goals a reality, but all she has in her life is her job, grocery shopping and the gym. While working on a deal, she meets Adam Kirliss. Adam attempts to hit on Taylor, but she thwarts his attempts and he takes it gracefully...or does he?\n\nWith the deal complete, the CEO has a party on his yacht, but it gets spiced up when Adam handcuffs her to the railing giving her one of the most amazing orgasms. Taylor shoves off the memories of the night as succumbing to champagne, but Adam won\'t release her. He sets up a date. A date she can\'t refuse. The only rule being the safe word he gave her....and obey everything he tells her to do.\n\nI enjoyed this book, but also cringed a lot as I read it. While I knew there would be elements of BDSM, it was very deep for a first encounter. First off, I don\'t really know how Adam "knows" all about Taylor and what she needs. He pushes her hard, demanding she let loose and give in to him. He does say he doesn\'t want a slave, which confused me on if this was just a one time thing or if she was becoming his submissive. The library is set up for BDSM, so I would say this was not a one time thing. He is in total control and nothing seems to be taboo or off limits. In fact they never discuss any limits on what he is allowed to do and what she will not let happen. I do applaud the use of a safe word, but I felt at times she needed to use it and was too stubborn to do so.\n\nThis book is very dark. It deals with a lot of internal feelings that are bottled up. Adam chisels at Taylor creating cracks in her glossy finish. The things he does to her are harsh and often I was saying her safe word for her. What I think the problem is, is that Taylor really had not been exposed to BDSM and to suddenly be in such a tough situation and take it like someone who has done it a while really concerned me. I know the book is a novella and you can\'t just drag the book out, but it seemed fast for a first session in BDSM.\n\nWhile I liked this book, it wasn\'t the best BDSM book I have read. It does deal with spankings, anal penetration, being tied up, orgasm denial, etc. So be far warned, it\'s not a typical romance book. It is deeper and darker than a lot of typical romance books. Not to be so harsh on Adam, he does have a lot of redeeming qualities, but you don\'t see those until after the major scene in the book. It might have been nice to know more about the characters before going so deep. Overall, it was a good book, but definitely not a book everyone would be interested in.'
3	'This was well written and had nice world and story building. I was pleasantly surprised. I will absolutely looking for more by this author.'
3	"Engaged at The Chatsfield  was a nice prequel to a new series called The Chatsfield but I felt like it was too short and I felt like the ending was rushed  and I just didn't connect with the heroine Juliet  and the hero Marcus."
3	'Enjoyed this book. Will read more by this author. Interesting ideas written well. Not a lot of action but enough'
3	"Fun, easy read. I will read the rest of the series. I'll read other books by the author as well, if they're free."
3	'Very good! I bought the series.'
3	'I ordered this book because I loved A Man Called Ove! It was just a wonderful book and I loved his writing. Unfortunately, I wasn\'t really impressed with this book. The story was pleasant but a little implausible and perhaps a little juvenile. The story is told from the point of view of a seven year old. I found it a little difficult to believe that a seven year old had the kind of maturity and insight the author credited her with throughout the story. Also, I felt as if the author was "forcing" the humor by repeating the same lines over and over; for me, it was a little bit of a turn off and kind of annoying. Also, I felt like he was re-using some of the character traits and similar situations from his previous book, A Man Called Ove to model these characters in this book after. I felt kind of like he cheated the reader from having different authentic characters. They are different characters, but if you read both books you will be able to recognize the resemblance. I\'m not going to say this book is a waste of time because it is a light-hearted read with a touch of mystery. I would suggest this if you have read a book that has emotionally drained you! It\'s a bit of a mindless read. Definitely nothing like A Man Called Ove!'
2	'Ok read very predictable. Not enough evolution of the characters or storyline overall not very entertaining'
3	"There is not much of a message here, but if you don't have to wash your car it's something to do."
3	"This was a fun read overall and made the time pass on my commute today.  But, I was a bit brought out of the moment by some really bad editing.  Items like the word debilitating being used in place of depilatating; incorrect use of your, entire paragraphs where the wife's friend is referred to by the wife's name completely distract from the story as you wonder if the author has even heard of editing.  Find two half wit slaves to read it over for you if need be, but for goodness sake, do something.\n\nThe end was a little forced like it was being hastily wrapped up, but overall, it was an engaging read.  At the very least I don't feel like I was cheated out of my money."
3	"Very erotica I can't complain there, but not much of a DP person that was a turn off to me. But Nectar liked it plus more. She tells how she got into loving sex so much with the help of her sister Suga. Sugar is something else show her sister dirt at a early age which lead Nectar trying out something's herself. Becoming addicted to sex and enjoying being DP she had to find someone on her level so going from one man to another until she found what she wanted in two men. Overall if you enjoy DP talking with men acting like babies being attached to a nipple every minute of the day then you will like this book. I give it a 3 because some of the sex screens was okay to read, but also due that I can't complain to much it was free."
3	'Beginning was slow, took several chapters to catch my interest but it did finally. I rated it 3 stars because as a series, it may have potential. I will read the second book when published.'
1	'Unlikeable characters in a plot that goes nowhere...I rarely give up on a book but did on this one.  Not even worth $1.99'
3	"I am stunned by the last half of this book. Bell Aurora you have done it again. Poor Cat goes through a rollercoaster of emotions her world is literally falling a part around her so many secrets are uncovered. Yet so much still needs to be revealed. I can't say much without giving anything a way but no one in this book is who you think they are. Friendships are tested and bonds are broken what's Night Fury to do but fight back?"
3	'It was repetitive and the flipping back and forth from 1985 to present was irritating.'
3	"There was something so addicting about this Little Mermaid retelling. I enjoyed the twists and the character's relationships with family members and friends. This is a light read, and definitely flew by quickly."
3	'this is a funny and entertaining book. not a masterpiece, but a good way to spend a few spare, lazy hours if you have that luxury!'
3	'Light reading, funny.'
3	"The book was easy to read and was interesting but it seemed to be r a little like an advertisement for rescue places. I got the message right away and didn't need it repeated so much."
3	'It was a nice & easy read. The story was a little obvious but as I said it was an easy read. I did enjoy it.'
3	"I am working on changing my diet and this book was a suggestion I haven't gotten all the way thru only the first 1/2.  Was interesting but soon found dry - had good information and was interesting to find out the change in Wheat and why it isn't recommended with our diet today to those changes."
2	"I get caught in storylines and want to find out how they end. This is not well written and it's assumptions about a lack of historical knowledge on the part of the characters is irritating. There are assumptions made about Jew and Catholics knowledge of each other that do the book a disservice. Perhaps some of the Orthodox Jewish communities really do not know how non-Jews live, but I do not see that as being true for American Catholic clergy, especially those who live in big, multiethnic communities in these current days. Not with all the Ecumenical Councils thriving across the nation. It would have been true back in the mid seventies for priests in smaller parishes and it is still true for evangelical, fundamentalist Christians whose clergy eschew the ecumenical groups. The ending was not just sad, but didn't fit the arc of the story or rather, was not well enough written to carry it out. I will not be reading another book of this author in the near future unless I learn his writing and historical and cultural research efforts have improved."
3	'This is the average Amish cookbook, nothing new, however if you like the basic in Amish recipes then this would be your pick. The only  exception is she called the Amish ,Pennsylvania  Dutch, they are not. The German Lutherans who settled in Berk and Buck countries  are the Pennsylvania Dutch, the Amish  are just that , Amish, totally different, no ties with the Pennsylvania Dutch or Mennonites.'
3	"Levine throws protagonists from two series together in Bum Rap.  The story unfolds without giving the reader a mystery to solve.  It's still an interesting yarn but not what I was looking for."
2	'While this book does give you step by step drawings, I expected a little more instruction--there was none. If you are already handy with drawing this might help but not to a novice.'
2	'The plot has many twists and turns, but few are believable, as a result this mystery falls flat. I would not recommend it.'
2	"Every writer (especially hugely successful ones) has a unique voice, a style that is distinctive. Few writers are more unique and distinctive than Raymond Chandler. Ironically, the same is true for John Banville, especially in his incarnation as Benjamin Black. His Quirke series has some wonderful titles. That said, one can only wonder why this fellow decided to have a go at trying to write a Raymond Chandler novel. It is a failure of positively epic proportions.\n\nThere are linguistic weirdnesses - like referring to a cigarette as a pill or a worker as a navvy (never on this side of the ocean); and a near complete inability to inhabit the North American manner of speech (the idioms) of the 40s/50s. He refers to a soft drink as soda in some spots, and pop in others. (Did he even have an editor/copy editor???) The plot is tired, done-to-death stuff that had its day more than half a century ago, when even the Chandler imitators at least got the lingo right.\n\nIronically, the book only feels valid and alive when the Irish-born mother of the titled black-eyed blonde is onstage. Her language and manner are entirely realistic because of course the author is Irish and he would get that right.\n\nThere is a classic Yiddish word for someone who has the temerity to get above himself: chutzpah. Sometimes it's admirable, often it's lamentable. This review is getting two stars only because of Banville/Black's previous efforts. The chutzpah gets him less than one star. Go read (or reread as I did for this review) some classic Chandler instead."
3	'Well I liked the walking trees but I have to characterize the novels as space opera lite.'
3	'Nile I generally liked the recipes, I did not like that I had to use a carb calculator to figure out the net carbs per serving. Adding that information would raise this to five stars.'
3	'It was ok for a fast read, but sounded a lot like a motivational speaker telling you how nothing matters so do what you want to be great.\n\ncliche message.'
1	'This was the worst book I have ever read!!! How did it end? One of the main characters gets drugged and raped. Good times.  I know these authors need you to buy their books, but come on.'
1	'Questions good, but very few in actual DMV test'
2	'This book doesn\'t really follow a coherent stream. There might be some logic to the way it\'s laid out, probably chronological, but there is nothing else to connect one document to another. There also seem to have been images at one point, but these are not available in the Kindle edition, which makes the book even more confusing. For extreme history buffs on the region, it might be useful, especially if there is a specific detail one is in search for, but otherwise, it\'s like to be more of a frustration than anything.\n\nThe one detail that I enjoyed was the dry language, "From the Close-Gate there are an hundred and forty steps, on the top of the wall, as it mounts a very steep hill to White-Friar-Tower, at the distance of sixty-nine yards and one foot. The common name of these, i .e. the Break-Neck-Stairs, is of very obvious etymology." This actually made me laugh a lot, so I guess, if you\'re in search of severely academic language.'
2	"Not a bad book, but nothing that I didn't really know.  And frankly, I'm not even extremely savvy concerning apps. I guess it's informational if you've been in quarantine without internet access for a few years."
1	'The WWII generation had it made economically in the 50s. Food and housing were cheap, and the so-called "silent generation" was heedless and hedonistic ("Mad Men" captured it well). The "fat generation" had canned macaroni and cheese with sliced hot dogs for dinner while their parents had cocktails and nice meals made from scratch.  Then the parents hypocritically shamed their growing daughters for addiction to junk food brought on by the emptiness of poor quality foods. More importantly, another emptiness was brought on by \'50s parents who were emotionally out to lunch. To borrow a phrase from Malcolm X, the obesity epidemic is an example of the chickens coming home to roost.\n\nThe author\'s "facts" are based on limited data and the logic she bases her arguments on is tenuous, at best.  Medical science will tell you that eating and obesity patterns are familial and not generational.  Using the author\'s logic, we could say that we are also at fault for the increased rates of autism, disabilities, etc., and ignore the fact that 50s mothers took thalidomide, drank and smoked while pregnant, and ingested God knows what other chemicals.'
1	"I rented this for my Kindle. Those reading should be aware that it was written with women in the UK in mind. Therefore, everything the author is talking about refers to the system in that country. I realized that once she started talking about their paid 9 months of maternity leave...\n\nAside from that, the book isn't really helpful in the form of what you would expect from books on pregnancy written by professionals. It's more like a girlfriend giving you the pros and cons for every single decision you'll make during pregnancy, which isn't really helpful in the first place. Really boring. Really dry."
3	"There are no charts, illustrations and no page numbers in the kindle edition, even if there is reference in the text. The missing features make consultation very dificult. Otherwise,  this Julia Child's  book  is a great help, because of its classic recipes  for the fundamentals of cooking. I did not repent buying it, would do it again!  But if you can, buy the English edition!"
2	'All I really found in this book was information I could have found by just searching Google for the exact same thing.'
2	'Not my favorite story.  I always try to stick with a book once I start it and I finished this one as well, but it was a struggle.  The story was slow and confusing at times.  Maybe it was confusing because it was not gripping and I kept losing interest.  This definitely helped me go to sleep each night.'
3	"Emma meets Max in a club in FL where he immediately propositions her for sex.  The next day they are on the same flight to NY. When they arrive he introduces her to his parents as his fianc and she goes with it.  See, he needs to be engaged by his 26th birthday in order to get his trust fund.  He agrees to pay for her school if she'll pretend to be his fianc for the three months until his birthday.\nDespite his man ho ways she ends up sleeping with him sans condom. He disappears often, takes another woman out, but she acts like a randy teenager when he comes around.\nThe love story was hard to believe since they spent little 'real' time together.  He leaves, she learns she is pregnant, he comes back, she lets him back in.  Also, she wanted to forget him but was still living in the apartment that he owned.\nBig problem for me was the timeline around the baby's arrival. When Max came back Emma said she was eight weeks from her due date but when she went into labor she says she is only twenty-eight weeks. Now if my math is correct, Max had been back there or so weeks at that point so she would be in safe territory for delivery at thirty-five weeks."

3	'3.5 stars--PLAYING KNOTTY is an adult, contemporary erotic romance storyline that focuses on rope and knot play-the bondage part of BDSM. This is bookstore owner Emma Green, and accountant/bondage instructor Ian Coopers storyline. Most of the storyline takes place in and around Boston and Emmas book store-PROLOGUE.\n\nTold from alternating third person perspectives, the premise follows Ian Cooper as he endeavors to find a suitable location and model for his next bondage instruction class. Enter former high school acquaintance Emma Green, who has some available space at the back of her store. It just so happens that Emma is in need of a quick influx of cash and Ian offers room rental and modeling fees if Emma is willing to be his bondage model. What ensues is Emmas introduction into rope and knot play, something she takes to like a duck to water.\n\nEmma has some issues of self esteem; raised by a mother who was always concerned about physical beauty and image, Emma has always believed she is not quite good enough, pretty enough, slim enough or smart enough to make it on her own. Ian happens to be the man who sees a beautiful woman who has no problems with the kinky side of Ians life\n\nNine years earlier, Ian had a small crush on his high school friend and lab partner Emma Green. Fast forward to present day and all of Ians fantasies are about to come true. The sexual relationship is enhanced by their mutual arousal through rope and knot play, and in this their friendship and working relationship takes the next step forward.\n\nThe secondary and supporting characters include Emmas employee and wanna be poet Bethany; Emmas friends Alina and Margot whose expensive tastes are not conducive to Emmas current financial situation : Ians best friend Brent who owns a small gamers shop ; several members of Ians workshops and weekend bondage role players; and Emmas slightly dysfunctional family including her younger sister Julia whose own life is now affected by their mothers need for perfection and control.\n\nSaying that, I did have some issues with the couples lack of communication outside of the bondage scenes. Most of the anxiety and uneasy situations in their relationship were caused by confusion and misinterpretation of body language and communication with one another in their daily lives. In this, my enjoyment level of the storyline was affected by the misunderstandings and heartbreaking beliefs that neither one was interested in a permanent relationship yet no one was willing to make the first move. I know this is where the storyline conflict arises, but it made for some awkward and frustrating moments.\n\nThere is also an enormous amount of detailed description and information about bondage play that shows the authors research and personal experience with ropes and knots.  At times, I found myself lost in the intricate explanation and information trying to imagine in my mind the how and what of the narration. I found myself struggling during the how to and play by play scenarios-I think my eyes glazed over a time or two.\n\nElia Winters puts her own spin on the BDSM writing genre-one where bondage and knot play are at the center of our couples sexual awakenings and arousal. If you are looking for something a little different; a little out of the ordinary give Playing Knotty a try.\n\nPLAYING KNOTTY is an interesting read; a detour from the usual BDSM storylines where the hero has a need to discipline the female. The rope/knot/and bondage'
3	"Daisy Chain by Grace McDermott\nCouldn't quite get a handle on this one. It's about fairies and the life they lead\ntil they attend the daisy marriage. That part I liked, so carefree and no rules to follow.\nLots of use of 'f' word which I don't believe need to be in books, lots of abuse and violence if you read between the lines.\nThink if I had read the series from book 1 it might've made more sense to me.\nI received this book from Library Thing in exchange for my honest review."
3	"The author is my favorite uncle, so how could I not?  I recommend to anyone who knows Art or played baseball in Iowa in the 50's and 60's.  Always fun to read real life experiences of people you know."
3	"This was the first Teresa Slack novel I've read where I could actually relate to the protagonist. Her no-good drunken sister abandons her two fatherless children at the side of the road, and our protagonist is left with a dilemma. She can disrupt her comfortable life to become a single mother herself, or she can surrender the children to foster care. She opts to keep the kids until her sister turns up to claim them, and in time, she learns to love them. The problem is, while I could relate to Michelle's predicament, it wasn't enough to keep me interested. We just go along, month after month, reading about these kids and Michelle's constant reminiscing on her own unpleasant childhood until I found myself skimming through chapter after chapter, waiting for something to happen. And then the author brings in this divorced guy Michelle doesn't even like, but she dates because she doesn't think anything will ever develop with the guy she does like. Talk about a screwed-up mess in the making. I couldn't stomach anymore. There's a second book, but I won't be reading it. This is just too dysfunctional for my tastes."
2	'Written in that (in this case, tedious) classic style of the period, I must say it was just too much of the saccharine drama for me. Thomas Dixon is an earnest writer but is a hagiographer rather than a biographer.'
1	'I have truly enjoyed all of Ms. le Vegue\'s historical books. As I read sea of dreams I found myself wondering time and time again if this book was written by a silly teenager and accidentally credited to Ms. Le Veque, this book had none of her flair or in depth research. The Hero was supposed to be this amazing Navy SEAL, team commander and honorable guy, but he also almost gets in a fist fight with his commanding officer over being deployed with his team???!!! No way would this happen, a team leader would not disregard his men in that way. When Beck is captured, because he traded himself to an Afganistan warlord with Taliban sympathies for the release of 21 S.E.A.L.\'s (yea right) Blakesly offers all she has in the form of a $30 Million ransom to get him released. Ok, why would you give the Taliban $30 Million to further finance their terrorist activities,making your husbands job more dangerous and risk of capture for Ransome even greater??? I got so sick of Beck and Blakesly crying about their love and yet they never really put on their grown up pants and showed the integrity and honor of a military family. The Navy was portrayed as the "villain" in this book, which I frankly found disgusting. In my opinion Blakesly was the villian because she couldn\'t love Beck enough to integrate herself into the military life and support him in his chosen profession. Ms. Le Vegue please research the armed forces and especially the personality of our elite warriors better, they and their families sacrifice so much to protect and provide freedom, they are brave and committed not weepy and self centered. Usually Ms. le Vegue writes such strong men and women who overcome obstacles with dignity and find a way to do the right thing. This story was SO ANNOYING please write stronger modern characters.\n\nI would like to add that I, the account holder, am not the author of this review. It is my wife who uses my account, who reads these romance books and felt strongly enough about the poor writing of this book to review it. I however, did have to suffer through all of her venting about this book. After hearing all of it, I cant figure out why she even finished it. But now that she has, I can say, "Way to go main character. You just had more means fall into your lap, with which you can fund terrorism for years to come".\n\nThe real Mr. Robbins.'
3	"This book was found on Kindle unlimited and the review and sample looked interesting so I pushed the button and read In one day,,, well it is 2:40 am  so perhaps a little over.\nI thought I knew what to expect given the violent opening chapters but it became a lust story but the woman didn't just quit her responsibilities to play with the hero but continued to shoot, stab and poison him as she was falling for him.\nIn the end she didn't have daddy fix her problems but she went to granddad with a solution she could live with.\nI truly enjoyed this story and will be checking out this author more..."
1	'It is the book more expensive that I bought in my life. It have less than 20 pages and cero information.'
1	"The exercises in this book are too hard. So I don't even use it."
2	'This was a disappointment-it had so little content?  do not recommend this-it was no help.  It was incomplete and not even worth what i paid for it.'
3	'1  = Toxic Brain Pollution, i.e. What a waste!   \n2  = I Can\'t Believe I Read The Whole Thing!  \n3  = Readable, some problems & some good. Meh...  \n4  = Really Good!  Very few, if any problems.  \n5  = ALL TIME BEST!  Very few, if any problems.  \n\n  There, that done, on with the review.....\n\n  I liked that Suzzie was feisty and smart. I liked that she had loyalty to her bestie. I liked the premise of this story.  I giggled a couple of times.\n  I didn\'t like the way that the way the plot line started at the beginning (well duh) and then cut a whole HUGE chunk out and started all over again.  I felt that there was an entire first book missing, whose story was alluded to multiple times throughout this book.  I didn\'t like that the characters were all rather flat and felt that personalities and reactions were contrived and often didn\'t jive with the situation. I didn\'t like the "insta-love" and "insta-sex".  You can\'t love someone you don\'t know or understand and seriously who in their right mind would enthusiastically participate (and then encourage) sex right after {SPOILER}  being kidnapped by aliens  being drugged (not once but twice)  being restrained while being sexually tortured with pleasure.\n\n  Over all I felt that this story had the potential of being a interesting story with seriously kick ass Heroine\'s and squirm worthy Hero\'s. I feel that this author, while having talent, needs to hone her craft and learn to hear her characters come a life on their own without being groomed and circumscribed by the author.\n\n  Please author\'s, let the stories fit the characters, stop making the characters fit the stories.'
1	"The worst book ever! So unrealistic, how you gone have thugs talking like college professor's? Did not even waste my time buying part 2. Waste of my tome an money! Don't buy!!!"
1	"The book was poorly written; felt like something you'd be assigned in the sixth grade. It was also very short and leads you right up to the pending battle of Brandywine, and then just ends, with no conclusion. Very disappointing, but hey what do you want from a $.99 Kindle book. I won't be picking up the sequel."
2	"Another reviewer wrote this book is fluffy, that it is. It is also boring and stiff, I felt no connection between the H and H. Didn't feel any connection between any of the people except for the older Duke's mistress who threw a fit when she thought he was going to marry the heroine. Thank goodness it was short so at least I finished it."
2	"I have Ms. Leigh on my automatic buy list.  I am going to have to change that if this is where her writing is headed.  I for one do not want three different sides of a story told I would like to be entertained when I read.  This book didn't deliver that.  I really disliked the female character.  There was just nothing appealing about her character and actions.  Nothing to bring you into the her story.  The males all seemed dare I use the word I hate - STUPID.  Even the villain of the book was stupid.  This book reads like it was thrown together just for sake of producing something.  I will not be buying anything from this series again.  If I had never read the other books this author produced I would have said this was a first book for a new author.  This was just really bad. What is really sad is that I read it twice before posting this review thinking the first time I read it I was just tired.  Nope - still just as bad."
3	'Good read. Its not written by Arnold.  It takes some of his quotes and expands on them.  Worth the time and $ to read it.'

1	'mediocre book'
2	'This review is not about the content of the book. The book I received had a different cover than what is shown. The cover shown has a storybook quality. The book I received did not.\nUpdate: The book had a miscut/torn page, which I learned about when the person receiving the gift opened it. Amazon replaced the book, telling me it would be the orange cover. It was not the orange cover but the pages were good.'
3	"I was able to finish this, so that's a plus. It seemed a tad unrealistic, but there were good enough parts that helped get me to the end."
1	'No real character development. Boring and not worth the time'
1	'I would advise anyone who is interested in this book to read the sample first before purchasing it.  The author writes like a 7 year old, with a LOT of "telling" and very little "showing".  I\'m sure this story would have been great if the writer polished up their writing skills to make it more readable and exciting.'
3	'I cannot get the ending .  There is some error, very annoying.  How do I find the ending?'
1	"This book was pointless .\nIt's a waste of time .\nThe Dragon wasn't even funny -.-\nI thought I was gonna laugh but apparently all I did was waste my time ."
1	"Don't spend even one dollar on this. It is completely unreadable. The OCR text is so poorly done it is nearly impossible to read the English - making the Italian even less accessible. Worse, the English and Italian are not opposite one another. So, if your plan is to read the Italian with the English side-by-side in order to understand the opera - you will have no chance."
1	"It only has part of each story so if you want to know what happens you'll have to buy the actual book."
2	"I thought this book was slow in parts and sort of boring. Not as good as Suzanne Fisher's other books or series.  It was hard to keep reading and I didn't enjoy it that much."

2	'It was not what I expected.  I think that someone who wished to study this family would have found it more pleasurable.'
3	'for those trying to lose weight its a definite buy! great info!!'
2	"If the last half of this book had lived up to the first half, I would have given it more stars, but for me, it quickly devolved into syrupy sweetness. Misuse of words, no contractions, etc. didn't help either. I basically leafed through pages to get to the end."
1	"Book just didn't resonate with me."
3	'Frankly the author is more affective when she writes less. At three hundred pages this book is too long to be an interesting story. Peri becomes involved in the hunt for the treasure connected with her family inher small Texas town. We have ghosts, magic, demons and secrets hidden by spells. I just could not get in it. The original idea of a woman fighting her ability to see ghosts was nice. It has now morphed in to more of a witch hunting, demon fighting tale. Just not my cup of tea. Miss the simplicity of the original story.'
3	"I am prepping for a full marathon this year but I don't feel that the training program in this book would be adequate enough. The book contains helpful hints for a beginning runner however."
1	'I had expected a story that had more kick to it based on the description. The story I felt did not develop well and the ending was terribly dull and predictable.\nI cannot recommend this book'
2	'The Houston Chronicle used to be a really good, unbiased news paper. Now, we only read what\'s interesting to us because its writers are so political instead of just reporting the news, they lean towards how "they" feel. If it weren\'t for the sports section and crossword puzzle. I\'d never read the rest of it.'
3	'Good read, but lacked substance. Storyline conflicts between main characters (the family) and perpetrator (scarecrow) at times semi-monotonous.'
1	'"You can make money if people will give money to you," is the premise of this advertisement being sold as a 2 page book.\n\nWant to know how to make money? How about putting on an Internet Halloween costume contest? Maybe you\'ll make money that way. Somebody did. Once. A while back. But he doesn\'t do it anymore. And the "book" doesn\'t tell you how to do it. It tells you that King Human did it. Once. A while back. But he does something else now.\n\nIn a nutshell, that\'s what you\'ll read in this "book," which isn\'t much longer than this review.'
1	"The Charles River Editors was founded by Harvard and MIT alumina however this edition has the quality of content that one would expect from a high school student.  There are editing errors/mis-usages in the text.  The treatment of all subjects is superficial and disjointed.  It is definitely not worth the price charged and I'm not certain it would be worth reading even as a give-away.  I will not be purchasing anything from Charles River Editors in the future."
2	'I found the characters uninteresting and gave up on it. What I did read I found boring and generated no intrest in continuing.'
3	'This was a good book to read.  I liked the characters and their story line.  I hope to read more from this author.'
1	'this was not good...'
3	'This book was not as good as the first in the series, but it was interesting as I learned quite a few good things about Ian Mann.  On the other hand, I also found out that I do not like the way the relationship is turning out between Andy and Jane.  It\'s much too fast to be believable.  Also, I think there was another possible scenario to the "murder" that they did not consider.'
3	'I got tired of the explanations of the fantasy world, and saying the little girl was almost 8 years old was ridiculous. But there were moments of humor that caught me off guard and made me laugh out loud.'
3	"Since you probably already know what the book is about, I will just give my reaction to it.  I loved the hero, he is a hunk.  Human but still the hero.  Liked the side characters as well.\n\nNow, the heroine.  This is where the story turned sour for me.  She is a photographer, pictures from the two wars, and now on assignment for a magazine taking pictures in Costa Rica.  She is a trust fund baby, raised with everything and more, but is determined to be independent and do everything her way.  Ok so far, but she seems to work over time to be one of the boys.  She can out ride, out drink, out play, etc.  Except for having a great body and a beautiful face, I wondered why the hero was even attracted to her.  She certainly didn't have a sense of fun or a great personality. She seemed to have a chip on her shoulder to me.\n\nOne thing I can't handle is the heroine making the hero look like a chump.  She does this on every page.  I finally gave up as she was drinking him under the table...a real attractive trait.  I'm sure he was in store for more stuff to be pulled on him but I just didn't want to go there.  I really didn't like her.  Of course, she had her problems but it didn't seem to keep her from being rude, abrasive, etc.  I just couldn't warm up to her.  In fact, I got rather tired of her showing him up at every turn.  Sort of cuts him down to his knees every time they get together.  And then she has to plot to show him up in front of everyone for not getting a frog off her leg quick enough.  Oh yeah, Isn't she super, embarrass him in front of his peers, that earns points.  I'm sure he is going to love it and think she is so cute! NOT.\n\nShe seems to have no regard for others either.  She pushes the envelope to get the best shot, not giving a thought to the fact that she is endangering other people's lives to be the hot shot!  I made it 42% and then I just quit.  I didn't want to even see HOW he Rescues Lacey.  Sorry , this one just wasn't for me.  I'm sure a lot will enjoy it so I suggest you read and make your own decision."
3	'I so hate not to leave a ravingly positive review of this book because I am such a huge fan of Victoria Smith\'s books, but like some of the other lukewarm reviews, this one didn\'t quite do it for me.  I loved the idea of a K-Pop star falling in love with Harley, a girl who has seen heartache in her life and had a difficult upbringing.  My youngest daughter (who is a young adult) is a HUGE fan of K-Pop, so I am very, very familiar with their music (sometimes painfully so). I\'ve also watched Korean movies and drama series with her so I have a good sense of how revered Korean "idols" are.  I thought the author\'s depiction of that world and how crazy the fans can be was very realistic.\n\nI also loved how independent Harley was and how she fought to be her own person and find her own way, both in her business and romantic life.  What was hard for me was the book seemed to drag in some places; I found myself putting the book down and starting another book.  Also, the writing style itself seemed to be somewhat stilted. I couldn\'t figure out if that was intentional bc the author was trying to convey how Sugar would think in English, since it was not his first language or the writing style was not up to Ms. Smith\'s usual standards of excellence.  If it was her intention to give the reader an inside view of how Sugar would think in English, then it didn\'t make sense that Harley\'s inner dialog would use this same stilted quality.\n\nIn prior books, I have thought that Ms. White writes some of the most tender, romantic love scenes in the romance genre; that was totally missing in this book. The love scenes were OK, but lacked the passion and even some of the innocence that has been portrayed in her other books. This was really surprising to me because she is one of the few authors who writes New Adult books that focus on relatively younger adults that I will actually read.  This book reminded me of why I\'m not that gun-ho about New Adult romance - too much angst due to immaturity!\n\nSo, I am disappointed in this book but I still remain an HUGE fan because I won\'t let one disappointment dampen my admiration of her work.  If she writes another book about the characters in this story (not sure if this is the beginning of a series or not), I will read it.'
3	"I admin the first thing that drew me was the cover - a girl and two hot guys - what can I say?\n\nWhat I loved was the hot sex between these three and can I say I am not one to overly enjoy M/M but the way the writer explored this along with then Katie joining in with the guys - OMG - that was really hot and heavy writing.  Also loved Katie's Gran she was a heart warming character who provided some light moments along the way and helped tie in the story of why Katie left town.\n\nWhere I felt let down with this was how underwhelmed I was with the end of this story, I was hoping it would build to some big drama but it all kind of fizzled out for me especially at the fair - it was all tied up too quickly and nicely.  It's kind of like your first sexual experience -  wham bam thank you - it's all over folks.\n\nOne other thing that was really expressed well was the connection between Ry and Jed but then with Katie it felt disjointed, perhaps because she did not live with them and she was merely a visitor to their house?\n\nI really would have loved a say 2 years down the track chapter of how it turned out for them as I was just feeling they were heading towards their happy ever after.\n\nEither way this was a quick and enjoyable read."
2	'Only 2 stars, maybe because i have read way too many motivational books and have seen almost all of these quotes before\nI would recommend this to anyone who has never read any motivational or self help or self improvement books.'
3	'Kind of basic stuff...nothing really new. Was hoping for my load data.'
3	'I felt there should have been more information.  The entire book was short.  When you are learning something new, there should be more examples.'
2	'okay to play but a bit boring. you can only use the letters in a linked sequence. not as fun as the original bookworm game.'
3	"Boohoo.  :(\n\nI absolutely love the Clans of Kalquor series by Tracy St. John, but sadly this one was probably my least favorite of all the Kalquor books Ive read so far.  :'(  Alien Caged is the 8th book of one of the best SciFi Erotica book series ever!\n\nThis story didn't feel as strong in my opinion as all the books that proceeded it.  I feel like it lacked that little UMPH which all the other stories had.  While the others keep you on the edge of your seat with a driven purpose, this story felt mosty as if it was written as an after thought.  Feeling like a filler story, you would think that maybe everyone wanted these specific characters to finally get the own book.  Only problem is that they were brand new characters, never before mentioned, so that was not the case.  Unless I have completely forgotten about them which I find hard to believe given my love for these books.\n\nEarther females in the Kalquor books have always had super tragic pasts which helps the reader become drawn to them on an emotion level.  The heroine of this book, Elisa, wasn't as emotionally traumatized as the other Earther females from previous stories.  An innocent kiss when she was still a kid got her in trouble, but there was no real tragedy for me to gravitate towards her as a character.\n\nI did like the Kalquorians in this book though!  Zemos, Oret, and Miragin were an older clan who was willing to pick a Matara unable to give them children.  Hell, they weren't even interested in having offspring because they were so focused on their careers.  That worked out great for Elise, a woman in her fifties, but it was sad that babies were not ever going to be an end result for this clan.  Babies make the world a happy place!\n\nI know all of the Kalquor books have been MMM or MMMF strictly including claned or potential clan members but after reading this one I hope that Joseph Walker, a Earther, and the single Nobek Almon get a story of their infatuation of each other!  Oh yes indeed!!"
2	'This book had good info but needed better organization.  This book is kind of helpful but I used other sources to find out what I need to know.'
1	"Completely uninteresting and then it ended just where the story actually started so then you would have to buy the next book. It's like it was a intro or something"
3	'i understand is just a cheat sheet, but still, it feels some information was left out'
1	'It was very poorly written & stupid!'
3	'Good Information.  I joined the Dave Ramsey movement and spent all that money and was not happy.  Everything was on the internet.  There are two other writers Debt Proof Living by Mary Hunt  and You can have what you want with the money you already have by Carol Keeffe.  I chose to work with Carol Keeffe.  I have excelled working her system.  My advise to all readers.......read all you can in all books you can find  and pick a system that is right for you and your life.  Do not spend money on internet hoopla.  You are trying to save money not spend it.  If you have to work your money management manually then do.  Just Pick a system and work it.  Saving, spending, etc.  is a habit.  Again, the information is out there and it is free....pick a system and work with it.'
1	'Not a good buy they only sent me the sample not the book!'
3	'The book is OK.  I made one of the cakes for our birthday girl.  I just prefer to have a real book for recipes.'
3	"I enjoyed the book, not great literature, but simple and romantic.\nIf you want sensual and erotic, this is NOT the book for you.\nClean romance with a happy ending.  Sometimes that's enough."
3	"I just finished this short story in one reading. I found it interesting, and enjoyed the author's twist on warewolves, etc, but I never fully got into it. Don't get me wrong, it is not a bad story, it just didn't pull me in. If it was a full length novel then I might not have stuck with it, then again, it might have grown on me instead, so who knows. Like many other reviewers have noted, there are some editing mistakes, but they were not so bad that they distracted me from the story. If you enjoy warewolves and are looking for a quick and easy short story then Claimed is worth taking a chance on."
3	'I stopped reading halfway through the second book.  As I lost interest.'
3	"This book was an OK read. I've read a many of her books, but this one took to long building a strong storyline and than it was rush. Overall it was a ok read with lots of sex."
3	"I read it in a couple of sittings. Dialog was good. Characters were somewhat predictable, but believable. Didn't care much for the ending, but it set you up for a sequel that I don't think I'm going to buy."
3	"I love reading books on Irish history The famine was the start of Ireland's road to freedom from British rule"
3	'This s book was very enlightening.  Great information for someone wanting to start a nonprofit.  I strongly recommend this book to gather information on starting a nonprofit'
2	"Another book I picked up for free on amazon.\n\nI use my slow cooker a lot - I'm a big fan - I own 4 different sized crock pots, I love them so much! So perhaps I'm not the best audience for a book like this, but for free, I couldn't resist.\n\nOnce again, this book is extremely short, and as the title (repeat yourself, much) says, it's only 52 recipes. There is absolutely no rhyme or reason or organization to the book - there's a chicken recipe, followed by a beef recipe, followed by a soup recipe, followed by a chicken recipe. Not one of the recipes was anything new to me or even a slight variation of recipes I already faithfully make, and most of them seemed identical to recipes you can freely get online."
2	'The book started out strong and was hard to put down. However, the ending was terrible. I felt it was unfinished and it left a lot of questions.'
1	"Unfortunately, no reviews had been left when I downloaded this book for free. If so, I wouldn't have bothered. This book is very heavy on the christian and light on the sci-fi. I read the book description before I downloaded it and thought it had an interesting premise. I made it through 28 chapters before giving up. I don't write off a book simply because there may be some religion in it. I expect it in EOTW fiction because everyone should be represented. This book is so heavily christian that I skipped pages of dialogue/inner monologue trying to get to the story.\nI didn't give the book a one-star rating because of the christian aspect but because the characters were so unbelievable and/or unbelievably terrible (especially the christian characters) and the fact that by chapter 28 I estimate that less than one chapter (in total) had been written about the aliens."
2	'A sweet love story with tons of potential- except that it was written so poorly.  It was difficult to identify with the characters because they were not fully developed.'
3	"I enjoyed this book but was a little surprised by its darker moments. Actually very dark!\nWell written and readable if you're ok with some pretty dark moments including a graphically described rape."
3	'Its a free book'
2	"The book has a lot of promise. It's an exciting story and I love that it features a heroine instead of a hero. However, the story darts from one point to the next without really tying up the previous point. Plus, there are a ton of inconsistencies that make it a frustrating read."
2	"The overall story was good but I feel it really needs editing.  And there were the little details:  vocabulary not of the Regency period, historical inaccuracies, etc.\n\nOur heroine is in London for the season even though she has no plans to marry.  Her parents had married against the wishes of family and rarely came to town.  She meets our hero and the pair are immediately attracted to each other.  But our hero has no desire to marry either.\n\nA couple of odd events occur and as a result our heroine becomes his mistress.  There is a villain but his reasons are sort of murky.  The heroine discovers she is expecting a child, the hero descends into further nasty behavior of trying to control her.\n\nThe characters didn't appeal to me all that much.  They seemed a bit juvenile.\n\nThe book was free.  It was one I am happy I didn't pay for."
1	'Lacked details, substance, if you want generality without the how to with detailed instructions this is not the book there are maany other bookss that will instruct.'
3	'Land of the Living, a metaphysical type of sci-fi e-book by James Pinard is a most unusual fictional offering with an explanatory prologue that provides the basic premise upon which the story rests. Briefly: Instead of thinking of time travel by moving the physical body through time with its many limitations, what about allowing the unfettered mind to travel to another mind in another body at any point in time, past or present, including our own?\nIn this book, the reader enters such a world in 2035 where a persons mind can travel through time and take over the body of someone who has just recently died. The only restriction being that there is no structural damage to brain or body and it is completed before any degenerative changes have been initiated. The live brain enters, blood flow initiates and normal function begins. The story then presents the reader with Michael Creed and his girlfriend Daria, respectively twenty-two and twenty-one year old college students as they leave their morgue drawers having just died of overdoses. The plot gradually reveals that Michael is associated in some manner with a secret band of time travelers whose mission is to fight another band whose activity centers on changing history in order to manipulate the past to form the future they want. Michaels task is to return to the year 1985 and enlist his fathers aide in the struggle. Such an addition is necessary because he is the only person with particularly developed sensibilities that can combat the only member of the dark side with the same capabilities. The action proceeds as the two join Michaels father and the struggle expands with several road bumps encountered along the way and the constant threat of imminent death from this dark side terminator.\nDiscussion: The author has opened his tale with thoughts from Nikola Tesla:  our entire biological system  the brain and the earth itself  work on the same (electrical) frequencies. If we can control that resonance system electronically, we can directly control the entire mental system of humankind. From here he has embarked upon an intriguing scenario that allows myriad thoughts about intriguing possibilities while simultaneously exploring interesting questions about both the past and the future and includes references to todays pressing problems of global warming, famine and disease. Also interestingly included are such personalities as Jack Kennedy, Whitney Houston, Patrick Swayze, Michael J. Fox and others. It is pure fantasy, or is it (?) bringing to mind the old adage  Never say never! The pace of the story is good and the action all that any action lover could want. However and most regrettably, the bouncing from episode to episode provides a quite jarring note at least for this reader.  Certain aspects of the manner in which minds can be replaced also may be somewhat difficult for the physiologically knowledgeable to accept.\nSummary: A story action devotees with restless, exploring minds will thoroughly enjoy - an exercise regrettably more difficult for those who prefer a more structured tale.'
3	"Every relationship has some issues, even if they do not extend to betrayal, and I love self help books so I thought why not!?\n\nMy first comment is on the title though. People are secretive about their issues, especially in relationships. Nobody is going to want to tell the world that the relationship they are in has problems but seriously not if someone is cheating! So I think the name could be a bit different to hopefully bring people in to read the book but not to scare them off.\n\nSecondly, the chapters are really short. I did like that for the most part and although the authors are telling the reader what to do, it's given in a way of like an aunt explaining something. Again, not exactly a bad thing but some people want more anecdotes, something to soften the blow type of thing. With the name, Get Over Yourself, it is definitely not a book that softens anything! And although the advice was sort of in your face at times, it is true. Most of us do need to get over ourselves!\n\nOne thing that I was really bad about was thinking that my way was always the right way. Obviously being in a relationship, whether married or just friend, this idea is never going to be true. The authors have a chapter on this and on many more subjects and how detrimental this kind of thinking can be to a relationship!\n\nThe information was short but good. Most of it I have heard before but we all need reminders every now and again."
3	"This book would be good for a beginner in ESL tutoring, but it did not tell me anything that I didn't already know."
1	'Just wanted to know what liberals believe in. THe classic example of "progressive\'s" delusion about the world.'
2	"I heard soo many good reviews on this book and the premise good so I thought WTH...lets give it a try.  Well, I only made it 70% before I stopped AND that was pushing it.  The letters back and forth in the beginning gave me a good feeling but as soon as the first real chapter hit I was thrown for a loop.  Somehow it transferred into a book about drug trade.  BIG surprise there considering nothing in the premise suggest it but ok...i'll keep going.  Yeah...that was a mistake.  I still haven't figured out if there was a real story in here at all because all it ended up being was sex, sex, sex.  I'm no prude but to me a book needs something else besides just sex.  Give me some substance.  I kept pushing through hoping for more but after 70% it still wasn't giving me much so I had to push it aside.  Maybe something happened to make it more of a story at the 71% mark but I just couldn't hold out any longer to find out. I can typically knock a good book out in 1 - 1.5 days but this book sat for months between me attempting to read it.  Perhaps Ella's other books are better but this one was just a no for me."
1	'But then it seems like the writer lost direction  the premise is very interesting but under developed. Entirely too convoluted at the end to even follow.  This seems like a second or third draft rather than a complete work. And the author seems to try and make up for it by using a lot of big fancy words.  But for a free book it was a decent read'
1	'not even a good magazine aticle. save your dollar. this is a thirty minuit read tht leaves you wondering what the author was thinking'
3	"For me, a great book is often marked by the extreme. In character, place, time, or events that take place, it challenges my understanding of the norm and brings me to something I might have not imagined myself. Simply put, I crave that challenge and accept it voraciously delving in and gobbling up every word. So when I was handed a copy of Diana Spechler's Who By Fire, I couldn't wait to begin again.\n\nThis first novel tells a story marred by extremes - a younger sister's kidnapping leads to the subsequent unraveling of both the family and the individual as characters search for solace, meaning, and forgiveness in their own way. Sister, Bits, seeks escape through sex; brother, Ash, through the strict religious teachings of an Israeli Yeshiva in as he dives completely into Orthodox Judaism; and mother, Ellie, caught in the middle of her own grief while desperately trying to sew together the shredding fabric of her family. When Ash cuts himself off completely from his mother and sister in favor of his new frum lifestyle, Ellie and Bits embark on a quest to bring him back to the mainstream begins.\n\n[...]"
2	'Luckily I received this book for free.  It only presented common sense advice and very little of that.  I would recommend passing on this one.'
2	'This novella was not needed as The Dead House was fine as a stand alone novel. I was bored reading it and it finished because I knew it was only a short novella.'
3	"I love color and carefully choose flowers to enhance the moods of my life. But they don't do what the flowers in this short do....manipulate my life. I haven't read any other works by this author, so I read this piece without any bias. I do however, have them all in my archives, so maybe I need to sample more as there were aspects of this piece that I did enjoy. The dialogue was clever. The downstairs neighbor throwing a party for a visiting Italian was an interesting character. But I was annoyed by the talking flowers focusing their 'passion rays' at the main character. Just too cheesy. Oh well...."
1	"Couldn't even finish it !"
3	'Suitable for someone just starting to research the topic.  At that level it was easy to read and pointed the OTA beginner to useful resources.'
2	'Not very insightful, had to force myself to finish this read. Glad it was free.  Would not recommend to purchase.'
2	'No real character development, the story was okay but the author Todd the story versus detailing things so the reader could "see", for themselves. The progression of the story felt forced and rushed to come to the conclusion that was very easy to see from almost the beginning.'
2	"As I read this  I was reminded of Robert Heinlein's early books. The plot is pretty straightforward, the characters aren't too complicated and the book as a whole is mildly interesting.  Its good for beach or vacation-reading.  The author needs a good editor.  I read the other two books in the trilogy.  Same evaluation.  If the books hadnt been so moderately priced I would not have bothered. Sorry, Mr. Weil.  I just cant get excited about these books."
3	'And I never cry. I guess I took it too personally because I lost my dog Zippy three years ago and I still miss him a lot.'
2	"I really enjoyed the first 2 books in the series but the next two were lackluster.  I'm done with this series, which is unfortunate because I like the writer and think she has talent.  I just think this story has run it's course.  It would be better to move on to new material than to beat a dead horse."
1	"No, seriously?  It is written as though someone just took a screenshot of a Google search for the benefits of coconut oil, copied the sentences that came  up in the blurbs, and then said, well, that's a book!\n\nHorrible."
3	'An interesting look at life inside the Mongols. From a literary viewpoint it is poorly written but what would one expect from an outlaw biker. Because he is still loyal to the Mongols it is not a tell all book from someone who is in the witness protection program. But it is raw and a rough and ready account of life in the 1% community.'
3	"The pros outweighed the cons for me in this book. Both main characters were likable and believable, and it was nice that the author avoided the simpering, poor, beautiful, weak girl falling for a domineering, rich, corporate mogul guy. The book starts off with a fun and racy scene, and then follows those characters and their friends as they fell in love. And unlike many modern Kindle romances, the characters don't stare at each others lips as a sign of attraction.\nCons: The characters seemed too immature for their ages (they seemed like they were just out of high school instead of mid to late twenties), occasionally their internal thinking went on too long, the language is typical of a new romance (fist is not a verb), and I hate cliffhanger endings like this one. Also,  the tone went from light and fun at the beginning of the book to gloomy at the end. I would have liked a steadier tone.\nThis was an enjoyable read, and I look forward to book two!"
2	"This is really nothing new - just another version of a bodybuilding split program, admittedly with a few twists thrown in. The author's preferences seem somewhat arbitrary, and some are downright bizarre; for instance his hatred for chin ups and straight legged deadlifts. Still, his enthusiasm for training and bodybuilding shines through, even though his appearance-over-function bias gets a little over the top at times.\n\nThe book is marred by numerous and frequent spelling mistakes - principle/principal, you/your/you're, and many others.\n\nI don't recommend this book. The program as written may well work if the trainee has a high tolerance for volume, intensity and training frequency. However, the book is entirely based on so-called bro-science, and should be taken with more than a grain of salt. There are much better programs; including free stuff on the net."
2	'There are many instances of \'slips\' in this book, where modern day words and phrases are used - the most notable being being the phrase "under the radar" and the book lacks credibilty as a result. The plot is lightweight with no originality except, perhaps, the setting in the Kimberly diamond diggings.'
1	'This is not what I thought I was buying.'
3	"Pretty good story with nice romantic tension, but skip chapter 12  if like me you don't care for graphic sex scenes."
3	"Honestly I did not like this one. The rest were great and Tor is an amazing character. Yes seeing tor from another person perspective is interesting but it feels that you don't get all what is going on. I would rather just see how the story plays out from just tor perspective for the rest of the series. Especially that is how the story began."
3	"I was disappointed in this book. I have read other books by this author that I found helpful and easy to understand. but this one seemed superfluous. He even implied that side loading apps to one's Kindle might not work, or be the wisest thing to do, but he wanted to tell us how, just in case we wanted to do it. That seems like a strange reason for writing a book. My feelings about this one will not keep me from reading other books by this author though, as most of them are great!"
2	'hoped that it would be more history and less sleeze'
3	"I received a digital copy of this via Romance ARCade for the purposes of providing a review. I received the entire serial, though I'm only reviewing Part Four here.\n\nIn this portion of the serial, time passes with Jennifer holding down the fort admirably. She makes things happen, and gets her guys back.\n\nAll major plot points are resolved in this final segment.\n\nThere was a scene near the end, with Athene, which I thought was wasted. It went nowhere, and so could have just been cut from the story. Perhaps Mr. Horton was paving the way for more in this universe.\n\nAs always, Horton needs a good editor, and a better acquaintance with the proper use of commas."

1	'abandoned reading'
2	"I managed to get a copy free of comments by Professor Winfrey thanks to another reviewer. As it turned out, probably wouldn't have made any difference. If you have read many stories about slavery, you will find little new here. I managed to read the whole thing but it was more a chore then a pleasure."
3	"I loved Samson and Amaury's tales, Gabriels was a little weird, but I appreciated the the approach and the change. However, by the 4th book, it was all getting to be predictable. I spent the money to have these books available for me to read while recovering from surgery and that's exactly what they did. However, the cheesy predictable male macho lines were anything but romantic or erotic. One word of advice, research a real males response to said event/scene/action/dialogue."
1	"The first page had such poor writing and grammatical errors I wasn't tempted to buy it."
2	'Long time getting into the plot. Weak story line.'
3	'I really enjoyed the story, and it is a quick, easy read. My only complaint is that over and over again i found myself extremely frustrated by poor sentence structure and unnecessary grammatical errors and typos. I would like to read the next book, but i hope the author can get a better editor the next time around. Three cheers for northern utah, though!'
1	'I tough was diferent.'
1	'A poor read.'
3	"I liked this book.  It was a little short and I felt like it could have used a little more depth and background on the characters.  I didn't feel real invested in the outcome of their relationship because I didn't feel like I got to know enough about them to care that much. I liked it for what it was but I've liked other books Lola Stark has written much more."
3	'This book was a little too basic and contained unoriginal information.  However, the writing style was great.'
3	"Wasn't exactly what I thought it would be. Good imagination great adjectivity but the basis of the story not my cup of tea"
3	"I started reading this not even really knowing what it was about.  It was a fast read and surprise it's about two men coming  together after a time has past.  It was sweet and I enjoyed it considering I had no clue about the story at first hahaha\n\nAlways a Romantic xoxo"
2	'Fun cozy mystery in need of SERIOUS editing!'
1	"I barely made it through the first chapter.  I'm not sure what book the previous reviewers were reading.  The writing was not completely horrible, but it was awkward.  The author couldn't keep track of the characters.  On one page Hazel is thinking about her father who was killed in the line of duty 6 years before and on the next, her father, the police chief, is calling her about a new murder.  Thank God I didn't pay for this."
3	"I think that this is a good start if you are just beginning your study of Social skills development. Some good point of views that most wouldn't notice or think of when have a conversation with someone."
3	'For some reason, this book was realllly poorly formatted! There were weird spacings and random underlines and a lot of strike-throughs as though it was a first draft? I liked the story (sort of a "behind the scenes at the nursing home in Anytown, U.S.A."), but for some reason, an inconsistancy involving a woman crocheting and later using a knitting needle ("threading" a knitting needle, no less...that\'s not a thing!) really bothered me!'

1	'I really wanted to subscribe to the WSJ on my new Kindle. But either the publishers or Bezos (Amazon) have made that experience undesirable and unlikely. Subpar content compared to printed edition. No internet access. Relatively expensive compared to other newspapers. It seems to me that anyone at the WSJ or Amazon that sees the poor ratings for this supposedly premium product would want to improve the value somehow. But it appears neither cares about customer satisfaction for this service. No WSJ subscription for me. What a shame, really.'
1	"Horrible. Just horrible. I'm not beating around the bush. This was horrible. I can even write better than this! I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. This bookwait for itwas a complete disgrace! Boy was I glad this book was for free! Phew!!!"
1	"I'm embarrassed to admit I've read this book. I've literally read every book that this author has written and can honestly say this is the worse book to date.\nI'm so disappointed,  I feel like the author had to know how bad this book was.\nThe fact that he actually published it speaks to the fact that he no longer cares what people actually think of him.\nSave your money.\n\nSigned a former reader"
1	'Lame.  While "The Life and Times of Jesus" was a thought provoking book based on extensive research and, yes, some speculation, this "rebuttal" book is nothing but a mean spirited defense of one mans religious believes who, apparently was offended by the book and felt his religion was under attack.  Which it was not.  It\'s a cheap book but don\'t bother buying it because it does not offer a counterpoint to "The Life and Times," only a waste of your time.'
3	'This book provides an interesting look at how magic was perceived decades ago.  It makes you think about how, or whether, these principles still apply today.  It is a slow read, and at times tedious.  However, for serious magicians, this is a must read.'
1	"Someone's afraid of the Christians being healthy huh!"
3	'A quick read but it bothered me that a lot was spelled wrong so many times.  Some cool adventures...I had been around the world and found some of these very interesting.'
3	'Story line was very good. However I did not care for this author I would not read any more of her books. Too much sexual intimate details. Not necessary to make a good story.'
3	'This book was a good beginners guide to preserving meats.  It was a little thin on recipies for sausages.  It also offered no tips on smoking meats. Overall it did give a good basis of charcuterie.'
3	'As I read the trilogy, I kept wondering, "When was the written?"  If it had been written in 1985,  I would have scored it higher.  It wasn\'t until I finished that I went back and saw that it was published in 2014.  There are a number of factual errors in the Korean and Vietnam portions of the book.  If the third section had been written in the mid 1980s at the height of the Cold War, it would be a darned good tale. However, published as late as it was, it simply spins off an implausible alternative history.  One of the problems I have was the number of "battle field promotions" granted that skip two or three ranks.  A private promoted to captain to light bird in two jumps?  Does the author not understand the knowledge gap between these ranks.  While I would certainly never assert that wisdom comes with rank, in order to function as a company or brigade commander, one needs to have more than an intuitive instinct for tactics.  I\'d assume that the author has taken W.E.B. Griffin\'s bemused (yet respectful) contempt for authoritarians and linked it with Tom Clancy\'s alternative line of history.  The product measures up to neither of the great masters.'
3	"In theory, this had great potential but ended up being a huge disappointment.  No matter the genre, I think books should be plot-driven. About  75% through it, the author suddenly seems to realize there isn't a plot and throws one in. The sex scenes are hot but they only carry a story so far."

1	'the book arrived after the suggested delivery date and, when i opened the package, the book looked like it had been totally water-logged and dried out.  a section of the book had a deep brown stain (hopefully coffee or tea). the dried water damage made it difficult to even open the book. it went directly into the trash. I will never buy from awesomebooks again.  should be awfulbooks.'
3	'I thought it was a decently original storyline, though nothing about God or faith was mentioned or central to the storyline so not sure how it got classified as a Christian romance. I got it in spite of the reviews on the poor editing and did finish the book but if you find typos, missing words and grammar mistakes distracting you probably want to pass on this ebook. It definitely needed a better editor/proofreader.'
3	'A good first book, worth seeing if the series develops.'
3	"This has all the elements required for a hostile novel including nasty fantasizing by the husband., who loves the idea but can't speak about to his younger wife. Deserves another half star for being fair to the characters and, unlike lesser examples, wraps things up nicely for the readers . If you're new to Anoka Butler it's a good place to start."
3	"Has potential but the lead character is thoroughly unlikeable.  Only  got about half way through. Just couldn't like the guy."
3	"I hate to say that I did not especially like this book.  I loved My Nights with Kate series so that is why I chose this book.  However, I thought it was very predictable and I really wasn't a fan of Mandy and Trey.  I understand that Mandy became friends with Liv in order to get closer to Trey and his family so that she could get even for what his family did to hers.  But, I just thought it was basic storytelling in that the dialogue was mediocre.  I may give book 2 a try at some point in time as I have read reviews that the books get increasingly better by the last one.  But, for right now, I'm stopping at book 1."

2	'The Warden\'s Daughter, the first installment of the A Fox\'s Tale series, is faced with the task of establishing the story\'s setting, introducing the characters and getting us started with the story. Unfortunately, the story\'s inaugural installment is not particularly strong on these regards, even if it may not be indicative of the quality of the rest of the series.\n\nThe story involves the main character, Ember Wulf, telling about her past, with occasional segments set in the present, when she is an adult. At this point, the Ember of the past is quite different from the present, but the contrast between them isn\'t played up as much as it could have been, as it might have been interesting to hear Ember\'s thoughts when looking back on herself in the past.\n\nThe other characters aren\'t very original or interesting. Ember\'s parents, while loving, aren\'t much more than the standard parents of the hero who tend to die just as the heroine sets off on her quest. The villains, Lord Drake and the Order of the Dragon, present a somewhat credible threat to the heroes, but, at least at this point, they don\'t have much of a motivation for forcibly recruiting those with talents apart from a mere hunger for power.\n\nThe setting doesn\'t seem particularly different from many other fantasy works, since it\'s a relatively standard setting that\'s slightly more advanced than usual (the presence of early guns indicates that it\'s Renaissance-era). It\'s good that the magic is explored in some depth, but some of the powers (transformation, control of fire) seem relatively standard. Jona\'s control over metal is somewhat overpowered for the setting, making metal weaponry and armor worse than a liability against him, and essentially ensuring that few people without powers stand a chance against him.\n\nThe dialogue is slightly stiff and wooden at times, occasionally doesn\'t transition well from one line to another, and often sounds somewhat cliched. Ember\'s first person narration was at times insightful, but sometimes, her emotional response to certain matters came off as a bit excessive (such as her father believing that she isn\'t yet ready to help him protect the wilds), making her seem immature and whiny at times. The action scenes are somewhat better, although the exchanges during combat suffer from the same problems as the rest of the dialogue.\n\nThe proofreading needs work. There are quite a few spelling errors(such as writing "then" instead of "than") missing commas and words that should be capitalized but aren\'t (for example, when Ember calls her parents "mother" and "dad"). The errors are frequent and noticeable enough that they detract from the overall reading experience.\n\nAll in all, the series is not off to an especially good start, but there\'s the possibility of it improving over time. If your expectations aren\'t too high, you might find that it\'s a good book for the price.'
1	'This book says nothing, and the author has gone out of his way to say nothing in a writing style that that is so poor it distract from the fact that the book says nothing.  Find any other book on running an weight loss and buy that instead.'
1	'I found this book very boring. I did not realize it was gonna be about letters this person wrote. I was expecting some type of story line type book.'
2	'One of my favorite fairy tales growing up.  I like the new twists writers have been putting on the classics, BUT this one I could have done without.  Thanks for trying anyway Mr. Lansky.'
3	'Very true to life, Most of us have been in situations such as this. Will read more of the books by Anne Enright to learn more about characters mentioned in this book.'
1	'Alex, do not quit your day job, as you are not yet ready as a writer.  This book reminds me of a narrative from a cheep video game.  I would not recommend this book to anyone.  If I had paid to read it, I would demand my money back.'
3	"Skylight has two compelling stances from the moment you pick it up. First, it is the work of the illustrious Jose Saramago, arguably one of the finest and most important writers of the twentieth century. Second, it is his first work, and, surprising to some and unsurprising to others, unpublished until this very moment.\n\nSkylight, as many reviewers have mentioned, is as much of an examination of marriages as it is about the people in the marriages. Taking place in post-war Portugal, six rooms in a building are examined, all with their own stories and twisted perceptions of themselves and the people around them. Make no mistake though - engaging in such a task is ambitious for any writer, let alone a debut novel. Saramago's touch in his older age (he didn't write professionally for at least twenty years since this novel never made the cut) feels apparent and immediate, and here the ideas are grand and touching, yet lack the refinement. Such in depth character examinations could take years of self / character examination.\n\nThat being said, for a debut novel it still has a lot to offer and remains a worthy read. While few things can touch the man at the pinnacle of his powers, even at a tender age of 30 his skill is greater than most writers of a similar age. For serious Saramago fans only, and for budding / beginning writers who want to see how even great work can be shelved."
1	'I heard about this massacre about six months ago. I was quite astounded that we haven\'t heard more about it.\nI am writing to say to the people who are upset that this fictional account of historic persons and events is a long and honorable literary tradition.\nThe relations of those portrayed in this novel are upset by the authors approach, would spend there time to better purpose really studying their family history and writing and publishing what their research revealed.\nGet off your duffs and prove to us the factual material didn\'t happen or if the novel grossly misrepresents in general the actual characters and events.\nI haven\'t delved deeply into this, but the belly-aching in some of these reviews seems to me preposterious. I have realitives who I love, but won\'t associate with because I find their beliefs and the actions stemming from said beliefs wrong, and in a few instantances, evil.\nRead the well-researched history books that claim to be completely historically accurate. See what you find and research to see if you agree.\nDumping on an author because she researched an important man involved in a very immoral act and then extrapolating  a novel or history from it, should be praised. This is how we think out and disacover different aspects of truth.\nIn is not cut-and-dry, who anyone who has the books on "the Mormon Murders" should know this. Such unwaranted criticism, has convinced me add this book to what I will read on the massacre.\nThen I willcome back and rate it and explain my feelings.'
3	'I like this book because the characters are from Texas, where interracial relationships are not allowed, nor accepted. I know this book is the imagination of the writer, but I wish I could go to Texas and find not just one good looking cowboy but two. Yahoo, ride em cowboys'
3	'I enjoyed this book still trying to get in the Christmas mood this year. Had a very nice twist to it!'
2	"This is a wonderful story, but it stops being about Nugget Creek at Chapter 6.  Chapter 6 through the rest of the book is another book called The Mystery of Willow Manor.  I don't know who edited this, but where is the rest of Nugget Creek.\nI hope Amazon will issue a new book with just Nugget Creek in it.\nHer books are wonderful and I look forward to reading the next one, so when this came up, of course I ordered it for my kindle.\nWhat a surprise it was when I found out the new book ended as I've said at Chapter 6."
3	'It was a decent read. Interesting characters, however not enough depth to make me  emotional for any of them.'
3	'Book was well writen:  Story was slow starting but whe it got going it worked well.  Easy read but coulc have been longer..'
3	"This novel was a unique take on the fairy tale. While I enjoyed the character Scarlette there were some aspects of  the story that I didn't care for. If you like fairy tales it is definitely worth reading. Just be advised I like my stories a little on the lighter side, which this isn't. Author does do a very nice job with dialogue, plot, characters and setting."
3	'Some very sensible advice.'
2	'Had a good start and a good finish with a few unexpected twists. Much in between was boring. I skimmed a lot of unnecessary filler. It could have been a shorter book and would have been better. The early tension between the woman and two men was a little corny especially the towel scene but in the end it worked out pretty well.'
3	'I enjoyed this book. Good imagery and clever, though bleak, vision of the future. Will look forward to more from this promising author.'
3	"I liked the beginning of this book a lot.  Logan, recently released from prison,  meets Caleb, the agoraphobic. Both men have clear well drawn personalities and quirks. But the subplots with the woman from Logan's work,  Caleb's uncle and the most managing parole officer ever seen (if only they had enough time to be so invested in each of their clients!)  just got too much for me.  By the time they went to the baseball match I was losing interest and when the completely manufactured drama occurred,  I put the book down. So it had a strong start but it got weaker and then I didn't finish it."
1	"Poor spelling and grammatical errors are distracting.\nI thought this would be Dave Barry-esque, but instead, it's just a lengthy rant about what junior high kids do on a bus. Spoiler alert: it's the same exact stuff we all did on a bus when we were that age."
1	"I couldn't read the book.  I skipped through all me, me, me and read the dialogue.  I will not be reading the other part of the story"
1	'I wish I could get the time back I wasted reading this book. I passed a few hours in airports reading this book and just wanted it to be over.  They are too many great books o waste your time on this one.'
3	"Primal - not to be confused with Sasha's other release Primal Male of the Psychic Hunters series is the second book in the Overwatch series and is about Adam whom readers get a glimpse of in the first book. Even though the BDSM club part really wasn't necessary the story would have worked just as well if she said that Adam was simply a kinky SOB. Either way we still get a sexy, dirty talking, panty dropping sweat maker.\nI thought the dynamic between Adam and Olivia was interesting and could have been explored more in depth however Primal really isn't that type of story.\nThe instant attraction was ofcourse a fundamental presence in the story and I did so enjoy watching Olivia come undone. Although I think there was more in her than was first assumed. I also felt that Adam is a bit more softer than he is hard since we get quite a few scenes with him coddling Olivia, being gentle and soft hearted. It will interest many ladies interested in a man that can dominate in bed (even though there isn't a lot of that dominance explored.) Primal is hot, its sweet, and its got a hero that women will love."
1	'A waste of time.'

3	'I started feeling like it was a nod to 50 Shades towards the end, older wealthy man, likes it a little kinky, domineering.  Younger attractive woman...'
3	'The story was interesting, and played out well.  But it desperately needed to be edited, start to finish.  I was hooked on the story, really engaged with the characters.  I think if it were longer, and fleshed out a bit more, it would be a five-plus for me.'
3	"I liked the idea of the story line.  Certainly the existence of PTSD in our military is a relevant subject.  I work in the criminal legal field and some of the things in the story didn't hold true for me...but I doubt that's  problem for every one.  I found it irritating when the hero jumped all over the place in his emotions about the heroine.  I also found the writing a bit choppy.  All in all however it was a different romance for me read  but  I did want to jump ahead.\nI received a free copy for an honest review from ARC"
1	'Not the actual book....'
2	'Just a short snippet of a book.'
2	'I loved the first book, thought the second one was ok. I only bought this one because of the reviews. Well...I was bored by all the excessive battle scenes and all the overwrought emoting that was going on In this book. When Jaron was Sage he was funny and wily and so entertaining. In this book he is but a shadow of his former self (hence the title?).  Because he still has a broken leg he is severely limited in his ability to be a bad ass like he was in former books. And , oh my god, all the sappy emoting that goes on in this book had me rolling my eyes so hard that they practically fell out of my head. I get it, I get it, love will save us all, but geez how about being a bit more subtle with that message?  The love stories are soooooo contrived.  I regret spending my money.'

1	'A person with a revelation is never at the mercy of unbelief. Jesus said that "All things are possible to those who believe." Unbelief is the cancer that eats the life out of any "supposed christian," and no where in scripture are we told to "rebut" another. The core issue is that not many ppl (especially self proclaimed scholars of the written word--most of whom don\'t know the Spirit on an intimate level--is that they have no idea what Love is, nor how to function in it. Truth has levels to it, and until something has been revealed through the Spirit, the mind will never see it.\n\nWhen a person finds a need to try and destroy another person\'s revelation, it is merely because they have none of their own and James says that where jealousy and envy exist--every evil is at work.\n\nI don\'t have to read this book to know that Holy spirit did not inspire it, please people don\'t live out of the natural realm your mind, come up into the place where Jesus said you are seated in heavenly places and let Him show you things that you don\'t yet know or understand. Your heart will take you places your mind will never go, but eventually once led into that place in God\'s heart, the mind can learn to become the servant to the spirit the way Jesus taught us through His earthly example.\n\nI coudn\'t find a zero, so 1 will have to do.'

1	"Satire isn't satire when it's directed at someone who is intelligent, resourceful and who the majority of the world accepts as deserving of respect whether simply for being a genuine improvement from the last bozo that stole the seat he sat upon and even worse, left the country in tatters, or an obvious wunderkind who fell into the right position when the country was in dire need of one. If you can't see the enigmatic nature of this individual, you may just be jealous. If you find his policies repulsive, you may just be the epitome of cruelty and the very kind that would let the country fall as long as you had your steak and whiskey. If you're going to satirize at least direct your over-the-top attempt toward the sycophancy of President Obama's adherents (who are, one could argue, less over-the-top than the satirists). Satire isn't satire when it's directed at someone the public recognizes as an ally. You can sit back and judge with derision, and call that judgement satire to shield you from criticism that you could get preaching the bigotry out-right in order to defend your own backward and outlying opinion."
2	'I read this book in Romancing the Military Man Box Set.  This is the 2nd book in the FLC Case Files Series and I didn\'t read the first one so maybe I missed some of the background that would have made this book more enjoyable/believable.\n\nAlana was a member of the First Ladies Club (FLC), a secret group that used bondage and seduction to put enemies of the US in compromising positions, filmed those sessions, and then used the sex tapes to blackmail or destroy the enemy. There is a suppossed BDSM room in the white house (I found this to be horribly unbelievable). So Alana somehow messed up and got hurt. Then the FLC gave her reconstructive survery on her face so she doesn\'t look like herself anymore and told everyone she was dead. (She had no choice in this and wasn\'t even told until after the fact). Then she was given a choice to train for a "security detail" or be killed. It turns out she was training to become an assassin. Again, I just found this unbelievable you can\'t make someone become an assassin. I didn\'t feel like Alana had the right temperment/personality to be an assassin.\n\nHer Trainer became her lover and it just so happened that he was a Dom. Alana had "played" the role of both Dom and Sub before but preferred being a Sub. I didn\'t find the D/s relationship in this book very realistic based on Alana\'s strong personality and independence. I never believed that she would accept her new role in the FLC as an assassin and I didn\'t buy the "love" story in this book'
2	'I was pleasantly surprised by the first recipe since it looked tasty and interesting. Most of the fish casseroles seemed worth a try. Sadly when I got to the chicken recipes, they fell into the same old cream soup trap. One recipe called for 3 cans of the stuff! And one recipe using ground beef called for cream of chicken soup which sounds unappetizing.  It is possible to make a delicious casserole without using unhealthy ingredients like cream soup but not with this cookbook.'
2	"I may or may not read the rest of the series.  Honestly, it just didn't grab me"
2	"I didn't make it through this book. I only got 38% into it. It was bad. This wasn't the worst book Ive ever read, but it was among the bottom ten. The characters were so flat that I don't think the author even knew anything about them. The prince went from sweet and lusty to domineering and requiring his human mate to become suddenly submissive before indulging either of their artificially induced lusts. You don't do that to someone you haven't even managed to have a conversation with. Because they hadnt had a conversation. Instead, they ate a fruit that made them lusty and helped with inhibitions and then bam, it was sexy time. Except I didn't get that far because ugh, it was so bad as to be off-putting. This author needs instruction on how to create three dimensional sympathetic characters, how to engage a reader in a story, and how to do research to make his/her stories believable. Unpublish, rewrite, add like 30k more words that is all character building and world building and this might be a readable sci-fi."
3	"This first book really needs an editor.  Mistakes and disorganization made a mess of what could have been a great story.  I'd love to see an edited version."
3	'I like having all the works and more in one handy volume. The pictures are ok on the Kindle. The problem I have it the dictionary does not work. It keeps saying I need to download a dictionary to work with the language. Since I already have 2 English language dictionaries, that is just wrong. Customer service was no help, maybe they should speak English. Anyway, this is the reason it has 3 stars. Not very fond of looking up the words although I do have the ability..it is just a convenience factor for me.'
1	'It read like the first original book.'
2	"The early chapters of this novel were interesting and pulled me in.  But, the main character, Josie, seemed to fall apart part way through the novel and the novel itself fell apart with her.  The last third of it just didn't make any sense."

2	'I found no new information on this book. What\'s written here are common knowledge and available for free at Mercola.com website.  Sugar causes gout.\n\nI\'m still not 100% convinced of sugar connection to gout. I\'m very skinny and not a dessert eater. I haven\'t had a sip of "soft drinks" in years.  My absolutely worst gout attack -which disabled me for over 14 days- was from eating Caribbean food for two weeks straight, mostly meat protein and plantain and sea food; not major sources of fructose. I didn\'t have any alcohol either.  I am suspecting a practice of "deep frying everything" common in Caribbean food was the culprit.  So I guess the oxidized oil was bad for me.\n\nOne time I had a gout attack from taking CoQ10 supplement for three days in a row.  Could someone please explain how that happened?  I think there is hidden mechanism yet to be discovered.'
3	"I don't particularly like the sadistic scenes, because it takes one back into time where men subdued women and treat them like slaves to be dealt with and used as they pleased.  I understand that in the Arab world there are certain cultures that US modern day westerners frown upon, but my personal opinion is that I doubt I would give in to this sort of sadism.  Other than that, it's not a bad book to read."

It's great that I can automatically use this dictionary whilst reading In Spanish on my Kindle.  I'd probably go ahead and buy the English Spanish dictionary, but one deterrent is that, as in the Spanish English dictionary, the translation shows up in a pale, hard to read font!  The Oxford dictionary that came with my old Kindle uses no faint font and is easily legible. Collins edition should come with normal fonts so that it, too, is easy to read!"

2	'Uncivilized continues with a heavy dose of modern marital qualms. Although Im always more interested in the chase, Im still perpetually fascinated with the after happily ever after. Following couples through marriage is an experience I try to soak vicariously but with no experience, I can really just ogle from the outside. This book was a predictable, realistic struggle in making time for love and reminding each other what is important. A seemingly simple message but what Im sure is incredibly hard to do.\n\nBut that was it. Busy parents with kids. Misunderstanding and mistiming galore like an unfunny sitcom.\n\nThe novella,quite frankly, should be called love:civilized. Zach has completely assimilated as a modern man so this book read as a basic slice-of-life story.\n\nIt was well-written but unremarkable. Thats how I felt about book 1 as well.'
1	"What a waste of paper! If you've read the first book in the series. Then you have already read this book. Seems more money just wanted to be made on this rehashed book. I loved the series. But this book was a disappointment and nothing new that you didn't already know."

2	"It is a bland little tale. Ok... but didn't interest my daughter in the least. It is also quite short."
1	'this book has almost as many significant errors in it as it has pages = it is definitely not worth buying'
3	"I enjoy this series but I'm getting kind of tired of the same ol same! I'm not gonna stalk the next installment since the plot seems to be repetitive. Nico is a tiger that doesnt change his stripes. Tania always bucks up towards the end. Nico has way too many issues. He doesnt need to be married living the single life...leave Tania alone! With that being said, I enjoyed the ride but I'm getting off this roller coaster. I encourage you to read part 8, but I'm gonna bow out here!"
1	"Too short of a story for me  but I've read this authors books before and she's a really good writer"
3	"I received a free copy in exchange for an honest review. The story had a few twist and keep me interested enough to finish in one sitting. Personally, I didn't like this one as well as the first. The story felt a bit choppy to me. It did not flow well even though the story itself had an enticing plot."
2	"The WSJ, isn't losing it's journalistic quality.  It's become more of a USA Today than a true business newspaper.  They've become a little too obsessed about politics, not as it pertains to business, but in other areas as well.  I want a business newspaper that tells me how events in the world are going to effect business and the stock market, not some candidates rhetoric.\nCompare the WSJ to FT.  Night and day."
3	"This is just a tease. I was interested in reading all three parts but now I'm so irrtated I may not."
1	'not steamy enough and the use of the vernacular for the female anatomy was over keel.  there is only so many time you can read the word and not get BORED.... snooze alert'
1	"Didn't like it. That's rare for me, to struggle to finish a book . Can't put a finger on the exact reason beyond just not liking it 50 shades  I didn't struggles even with His darkness this was just way off for me"
3	"I thoroughly enjoyed the first two books in this series. This one left me hanging. It was still a good read. I wanted to see more.about Wendy and company. Simone's character annoyed me this time around. She was  ridiculously religious and using that as her crutch and answer for everything. I wanted to really see what was going to happen with the new class of characters since the story around Simone and Regina was rather boring and didn't offer more, especially with the wife Toni. I thought she was misplaced and simply added for complexity. Maybe that's the fan of this series in me just wanting more than what was  given or the avid reader and writer. Either way the book was still good..just not my fave."
3	"I love Victor Gishler's stories.  He has a gift for writing pulpy noir.\n\nBut this one.  Well...\n\nOK, it was a 99 Kindle download, so I have no right to complain.  And in that regard, I got more than I paid for.  But c'mon guys.\n\nIf you're sitting on the beach and looking for a quick read, stop looking.  This is the perfect read for an afternoon when you're killing time and killing a six-pack and don't want to risk missing a critical plot twist or character nuance.  Even after your 4th or 5th beer, you still won't miss any of the subtleties of the story."
1	"It started off good but just didn't end good at all. The sex seen was good but not much after that."
2	"The price is right, but there's not much to it. A handful of one-page recipes and that's it."
3	"Rating: 3.5 Stars\n\nI found this book to be full of hot, steamy scenes and Cooper MacKenzie and Claire's relationship is full of that. Claire has tried to get Cooper to notice her for along time so she finds a way to get noticed by turning up at a BDSM club. It becomes a will he, won't he questions as Cooper doesn't seem to understand his feelings towards Claire. Feelings he has never experienced before. I do wish it was a bit longer as the story felt a bit rushed and maybe the characters could have been explored a bit more so i could understand a bit more of why Cooper was reluctant to get involved with Claire. Overall though, i did enjoy it."
3	'Ridiculous to have people reading 56 page book. Never ending up to book 22.\nWhen will it end.?\nBilking people of their money'
1	'Very poor formatting.  Very difficult to access individual books and pathetic indexing system.\nSPEND A LITTLE MORE MONEY AND AVOID THIS RIDICULOUS VERSION!!'
3	"Its decent, but doesn't give any advice that isn't written in GQ/Mens Health every month. I thought it would have more tips and more advice regarding specific hair types and hair styles etc. If you have never read anything about keeping up with your hair than it can be valuable."
3	"It's an okay book; not great, in my judgment, but if you're a western fan you might like it."
3	'A story of a pretty amazing life. In fact one has to wonder just how accurate it is! Still, quite interesting and gives good insight into the land that would become the\nState of texas.'
3	'Interesting. Good read but... the B&D is good but the S&M is off a little. Hot!'
1	'I was highly interested in this book since I am from Venezuela; sadly, I was in for a big disappointment... This book goes from so-so, to bad, to worse, and that in a particularly slow pace in a too long story... Although there is a lot of "action", it\'s meaningless and doesn\'t add any value to the story. The plot becames just too unbelievable and beyond crazy sci-fi stuff. All that aside, the way the author describes and portrays Santa Elena and its people is way far from the truth, given that he is taking a contemporary approach. Good geographical description of Canaima and Gran Sabana, though. Read up to 68% and had to give it up, even though I skimmed big portions of it but didn\'t care to know how it finished; thankfully it was free...'
1	'Not what I thought it was going to be  :('
3	"The Work of the Devil reminded me of Patricia Anthony's books. While not alike in content or tone, both feel like nods to the classic SF tale of first (or failed) contact. This novella reads like a treatment for a full length novel instead of a complete story in itself. It would work better as a between book supplemental to an ongoing series than it does as a stand alone. Evocative, well paced and beautifully written, The Work of the Devil ultimately fails to explain itself. With more questions raised than answered the reader is frustrated at the end. Still worth exploring for it's fresh take on a time honored standard but I wish the author had dedicated a few more (or less) pages to her world building. The division between the world of machines and the world of simplicity is too stark with little to connect them."
3	'I found the wording difficult to comprehend.  I was disappointed.  OB had a lot of words but seemed to fail to make a point.'
3	"There's lots of great info in this book, however many of the pages are cut off on the right hand side. All of the large charts are really unusable."
3	'to slow'
3	'I received this book from the author in exchange for an honest review.\nI enjoyed the book, but feel like it could have been a little longer. I felt like we got to know the heroine, Emily, just enough to sympathize with her, but not enough to really like her. I struggled with the character of Chase and understanding his motivation to get involved in the way he did. The under currents between Chase/Janet/ Chastity also left me a little confused.\nThe book also has a definite cliffhanger and it was handled fairly well. I am curious/looking forward to seeing what happens in part 2'
1	'Goofy novel written like the author was an English major high on weed and a touch of LSD or something.  This is not an excerpt from he book, but it gives you an idea of how nonsensical and goofy it is, "In this nice house, the raccoon is doing dishes at the sink.  She is thinking about her husband and how messy he was at dinner, but then he\'s dead anyway, so what can you do?"  It\'s in English and it\'s understandable, sort of, but really it\'s just goofy.  I guess if you like avant grade literature, you might like this.  Surrealism was never to my taste in art and it certainly isn\'t in fiction.  Kind of Twin Peaks meets Clockwork Orange.  Nope.'
3	'While the base idea for the story is interesting there is a feeling of being rushed through it. There is very little character development, we have no idea why these people are who they are. Benched takes up about 60% of the book. The remaining 40% is a second story, The Slot, which is actually a bit better.'
3	'Very predictable'
2	'This "book" was so short it wasn\'t even worth the read. Should have just been tacked on to the last book. Wasn\'t worth the price should be free.'
3	'The author has obviously studied a lot mediaevel history and literature and is determined to prove it in their writing. I like that the mentality of the characters is formed more around mediaevel notions than modern ones.  It is hard to read, I tended to skip over words and concepts that were unfamiliar.  Though I know a fair amount about archaic language and mediavel life, I still wasd in the dark about some of it.\n\nI like the sexuality and the mystery surrounding Guy.  Worth 99 cents :-)'
1	'I bought this based on the glowing reviews, so glad it was a freebie. I thought this would be a fun, nostalgic "ride".  I was expecting homespun wisdom, quirky characters, something like Mayberry, actual stories. But alas there was none to be found.  Instead by the 12% mark, there was preaching about the evil internet, a sight where you could purchase cards & then something about a grocery list site oh & lets just throw in a blurb about men tempted by pornography, didn\'t see that one coming.  However, I have to agree with the writer about chronically tardy people.  Speaking of time, there are better books to spend my time on than this one.'
3	'This book was marginal at best.  The first was better.  Hoping book 3 moves smoother.  The plot just did not hold my interest.'
2	"Did not like this game - maybe because the Kindle beat me every time! :( Just wasn't the type of game I like - prefer word games."
3	"This book had to much going on!!! Too many people in it and it was not a romance. I don't care about what happens to these characters! Disappointed!!!"
3	'This book is really not what I had expected. At times it was rather hard to get thru. Finally made it thru the book'
2	'Might be of interest to those interested in the history of wine industry in US or in gangster activities, but not to average reader/wine drinker.'
3	"I have read the first 3 books so I wanted to read this one. The sex level is this book is scorching hot. I only gave it 3 stars because I did not care for this one that much.\n\n1. In books 1-3 they were about older men (40's) meeting and falling in love with much younger women (early 20's). This book does not fall into that catergory. Max is in his 40's and Phobe is 39. I guess we are suppose to know she is different since she was not referred to as young in the book discription. Phoebe was a secondary character in book 2 and I don't remember her age being mentioned so how would I know?\n\n2. The flow of the story did not work. There were alot of grammar issues. Even Phoebe's name was misspelled at one point. It felt like this book was just thrown together. $2.99 is asking to much.\n\nI hope the author takes more time & care with the next book which is about Phoebe's best friend Victoria & Max's best friend/partner Drake."
3	"I can't even rate this because it doesn't work on the Kindle Touch.  Its quite a newer one but wasn't developed to use on the Kindle TOUCH.  Can this be updated to include it to work on the kindle TOUCH.  I love Mahjong!"
3	'The author writes very much like high school students  learning writing techniques. A good story but very immature use of language. . It felt stilted , too predictable and too stylized'
3	'Whyyyyyyyyyy?\n\nI love this premise. How fantastic!\n\nWhy was it written so badly?'
1	"Eisler offers some pretty standard advice here. There's no question Democrats have been poor at messaging but simply suggesting that they use cynical marketing techniques just like Republicans do is probably a small solution. Wiser does hit on a key towards the end when he points to the conundrum Democrats have in appealing to voters while assuaging donors.\nNow, solve that problem and you've really done something useful."
2	"Do not buy this book for survival pointers.  The book is about an infection that kills 99.9% of the world's population in a very short time period.  There are some un plausible parts. Like walking cause there are no cars around or carrying a sword for protection......remember most of the people died in very short time frame so cars and guns should be plentiful."
2	'This should be titled "Romance among the Ruins."  I had to put it down after reading 38% of it.  Stinnis is a good writer but his writing is plagued by the desire for long emotional dialogs between the two characters.  For example Mr Stinnis used more than several pages discussing the need for trust and the emotional need for trust by the primary protagonist.  Mr Stinnis has a good grasp of weapons, tactics, and training.  If he would just focus more on that rather than the emotional needs of his protagonist.\n\n I look forward to trying My Stinnis\'s next book.'
3	'It is a very readable story with interesting characters. Field weaves a nice plot that, while somewhat predictable, is enjoyable nonetheless.  The character development plays second fiddle to the plot but the story line was strong enough to keep me reading.'
3	"Saba runs a magic shop but also uses her gift as a psychic which brings her to the attention of the local  P D. Saba has helped the P D before and now a young woman had been found murdered with her blood drained and  the P D. turns to Saba for answers. A co-worker recommended Saba to Dale.  Dale is a detective and reluctantly goes to Saba who he believes is a fake. Saba is an Albah which is a race long forgotten by humans but were still around. Sabas power is fueled by blood and silver. Saba can use blood for readings and silver for small things like healing and warding. Saba proves to Dale she is the real thing  by telling facts from just a small amount of the victims blood. Dale did break a small protective barrier Saba had by Dales belief and the killer knew who she was and would be after Saba. The vampire leader.  can use blood to create bonds with his followers. It creates a bond when Saba does the reading for Dale Saba couldn't tell Dale all she knew as she had secrets to protect and a lot he simply wouldnt believe. Saba was attracted to Saba and she to him even though he resisted it. Dale believes she was murdered by the leader of a cult of wannabe vampires. But the killer left no clues for the police to find.  As Saba and Dales relationship heated up Saba wonders if she can keep who and what she is from Dale. Albah uses silver for small things but once an Albah is turned to a vampire silver is deadly to them.\nI  had mixed feelings on this book. I felt it had a good plot. I liked the different scenario on vampires and witches. It did pretty much keep my interest. This was a short read. I didn't like how Dale was an ass a lot. Then one conversation was suppose to change Dales whole outlook on psychics just don't think so. I think the pace was too fast. I also had problems connecting with both Dale and Saba. After the way Dale was acting I think Saba was way to nice and accepting. I felt there was some unanswered questions after the book was done. I also felt the book ended to fast. So as I said I did have mixed feelings."
1	"I deleted the book from my Kindle unread. Why? Because I couldn't read it! The entire manuscript was one long sentence - there wasn't ONE indentation in the entire book! I really, really wonder about all these five star reviews. Did anyone REALLY read this....this...thing?"
2	'Yet another "book" that conveys the same information that others would wrap up in one or two chapters. Just as it starts getting interesting it\'s over. I guess we are expected to buy the next book to find out if they make it to their bug out location. Then possibly a third book on surviving. It has the typical problems that editing would have fixed. I\'m feeling frustrated by this type of book. A sequel is one thing...this is just a partial story.'
2	"I got this as a free Kindle book, and it was on my Kindle long enough to view it and then deleted.  I have a 3 year old and she was bored with this.  Basically it is a different veggie on each page with the name of the veggie.  No story, no nothing.  After two pages she was bored.  This may be good for very young children but I was disappointed and glad I didn't pay for it."
1	'When I purchased this book I expected to be reading a science fiction story.  I am angered to find that the book contained a lot of pornography fantasies of the author, including very perverse sadism.  I wish I could have the purchase price returned.  I will never buy a novel from this author again.  I am disappointed that Amazon does not have a warning system for this.  When I purchase a science fiction book that is what I expect.  I will be more careful the next time I purchase anything from Amazon.'
2	'As a general rule, I figure that a novel needs to have characters that the reader cares about. Even if you hate the character, that\'s enough, and this novel has characters that are pleasant enough to suit anyone.\n\nAnd as a general rule, the setting needs to be interesting. Livi is in a small town flower shop during the VietNam era, which is certainly adequate. A brother has died in the war, a farmer has died in his field, loading a round bale on a Sunday.\n\nThe author needs to have a full toolbox of vocabulary and grammar, so that the words have humor, grace and color, and this author certainly has that.\n\nIn fact, this novel has everything it needs except an arc. This is a slice of life like a piece of cake: it just lays there. A novel needs to be a video clip, not a snapshot. In a stand-alone novel, the arc is about how things happen to change the protagonist. In a series, the arc is about how thing happen to change the characters surrounding the protagonist. In&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Delivery/dp/B0057ZA0FI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Delivery</a>, however, nothing ever seems to happen.\n\nBecause it has all those other elements, though, this might be a great book to read if you can\'t sleep. It certainly isn\'t going to keep you awake, wondering what\'s going to happen next. By the time you get a third of the way through the book, you\'re pretty sure that what will happen next is just more of the same.\n\nObviously, a lot of hard work went into this book, by a promising and talented author. Given a plot, her next book could be a great piece of literature.'
1	'But this lacss prooer quality would have been amazing if it had been like the cover,art and maybe even a sotry. Nope Barney aas more story thsn this. I can easily copy what the auhhor can do, its jsst time consuming and the difference is that BlockBoy is willing to do it. I sort of respect that, but its still not so good.'
3	'This books started out ok but by about 75% of the way through it seemed so repetitive.  Over and over they tried to kill him only to have their plans thwarted each time.  I finished it because I was already invested, but I have no desire to pick up book 2.'
1	"The product arrived in perfect shape but the content of the book itself was boring if you've already read the 1st 50 shades book; it's a complete reenactment with nothing new to get excited about. I absolutely LOVED the first 3 books but this book did nothing for me, I completely gave up under 100 pages in even though I was already bored less than 50 pages in. Don't waste your money."
1	'Very poorly written, not edited, incomplete thoughts and paragraphs, hard to follow. For an avid reader this is worse than junk reading.'
1	'This garbage really deserves no stars. How can this be teen/young adult literature? No sex and no language, but the book is brimming with senseless violence, torture, and suffering. It is pathetic. I was sick to my stomach from the first word to the last. It is a total mystery to me that I stayed with it all the way to the end. Maybe I had some inkling of hope that things would get better, but they didn\'t. There really was no plot and no outcome. Absolutely the worst book I have read for a while. I don\'t know what kind of a twisted mind would create this or enjoy reading it. I find it ironic that "teen literature" keeps out sex and language, but it deems killing and/or torturing your friends totally acceptable. I don\'t understand the logic behind it.'
3	'Thanks'
3	'I loved the story and the characters...and I am not one to usually say anything bad about something I got for free...however, I did have a little trouble following the characters at certain points.  Left me just a bit confused...maybe better editing?\nI am not one to give up reading a book or watching a movie....I see it to the end...bad or good.\nI would like to read the next book and see if the editing was better...'
3	"I don't usually read paranormal romance, but picked up this series because I like the author's other books.  I've found, the further I get into the series, the better the books get.  BUT, there are typos (I lost track of the number of times you're was used in place of your), missing details, wrong names, editorial issues - it feels like the book is being rushed into publication.  While I like the characters and the storyline - I find these sorts of things to be at the top of my pet peeve list.  If you can see your way past these things, read the series - I'm going to buy the 4th book because I need to know how Ruin and Isadore cope with what's going on..."
2	"I prefer stories with plots that move along instead of getting stuck in the minutiae. these stories should be condensed into very short stories. I don't have much experience with the sci fi genre but I can recognize a slim story line when I read one. I gave up on each story half way through."
2	"After reading the first book Solomon vs. Lord I was very disappointed at the author's attempt at a second book.  The book ended very abruptly.  It was still a good book through."

3	"You can find lists of app suggestions like this one for free online.  The apps suggested here are pretty standard suggestions--Kindle, Google Maps, etc.  I didn't find any suggestions for apps I would want to add.  The other thing was the descriptions were not very complete.  Sometimes I wasn't quite sure what the app was all about.  On the other hand, if you are new to iPad you might find this list helpful, and it is only $2.99."
1	"I felt the writers were too busy writing something for the erotic category rather than actually developing a story. I was pleased I hadn't had to pay for them."
3	'This book is very HOT, I mean HOT. It is very short. It ends almost as quick as it starts. So the plot is rather unrealistic, moves very fast. But none the less if you are look for a steamy little read with a hunky cowboy this one to read'
3	"With many holes and one big one. Pardon the pun. The whole attempt at secrecy and deception is untenable. Besides the story assumes astronomers around the world are sleeping. Do innocent people really get bumped off by those in power whose job is to protect the very people they eliminate? Didn't get the first part that had nothing to do with the rest of the story other than mention the devastation caused by a meteor."
3	"but this was pretty good.  Alien invasion?  World War III?  Or something totally different?  Teenagers taken prisoner and forced to farm without any idea what's going on in the rest of the world."
1	'Let me read the damn book. This is crap. I bought this book to read not to answer your questions'
1	"I thought this book would have more practical tips, but this seems to be a more general guide for why you should make time for family fun. We are already making time for family fun because we know how important it is and do not need to be convinced. I was hoping this book would have some ideas for activities we could do together that my pre-teens wouldn't think were totally lame. There were a couple ideas for games in one of the chapters, but they seem more geared toward elementary aged children than older kids or a family that covers a wide range of ages. Overall, the book was disappointing so I'm glad I caught it on a BookBub deal that enabled me to try it out for free. At least for me, that's about what it was worth."
3	"I prefer full length books but this was a nice filler. I was kind of strange seeing the same scenes, complete with dialogue, from Rand's prospective."
2	'I gave it 2 stars because, as a newbie to honey and bees, I appreciated the basic information that was provided, but what I really wanted was what it promised in the title. The title says, "How To Use Honey To Cure, Beautify And Heal (Herbal Remedies, Cures, Antiviral, Antibacterial, Natural, Cures, Skin, Hair ...)".  That is what I expected.  While there are recipes in this book, they are cooking and baking recipes only.  There is not one single recipe related to health or beautification.  Not a honey lemon tea recipe.  Not a "sugaring to remove unwanted hair" recipe.  Not one recipe for honey hair wash, facial scrub, or anything!  Just a mention that pure honey on a burn or cut will help it heal faster and that honey is good for your hair.'

3	'The story is interesting, however the writing is not the best quality (I understand that pilots are not trained writers).  There are numerous distracting editing errors throughout the book that are disappointing (with technology what it is today you would think these errors would be easily caught).  If the book makes a second printing it would behoove the writer to address these two things for future readers.'
3	'He goes into explanation several times about his technique. He also gives the option to email him with an explanation why you want a refund and asks for a plan that you had used. He also gives you the email and "PROMISES" to answer some of your questions. He\'s never responded to me on Facebook nor has he ever responded to me on email that he promises to do in the book.  I\'ll let you decide after that if this book was worth it.'
2	'Depressing characters and story line. Not to be read if you are wanting hope, inspiration or quality in literature.'
3	'I love Pamela Burford\'s books but "Snatched" is out in left field from what I expected. From the book description I thought it was kind of a madcap whodunnit. The story does have some zany moments but, comedy it ain\'t. The main character is a sociopath hunting for the 2 million dollars he buried before he went to prison on an unrelated murder charge. There are other important characters and subplots, one of which involves "fantasy" abductions. While there were some laugh-out-loud parts, it also included some really intense action and so many characters I almost needed a program to keep track. I had a hard time putting together a houseful of mostly unrelated characters, several of whom could only be described as bizarre, and throwing in a cold-blooded psychopath capable of abducting a child and cutting off his finger, only to return 25 years later hunting for his buried treasure. Call me dull and unoriginal but fantasizing about being abducted is beyond the pale. And for those who find amusement in psychotic behavior, I dunno. I never did figure out what this story was supposed to be, thus my 3 star rating.'

3	"I like this book I really do. I was looking through a few of the recipes and found a problem. In the coffee cake recipe it lists the ingredients then how to make it. When combining the ingredients it say to add buttermilk. Hmmmmmm. Didn't see buttermilk listed in the ingredients. Hopefully they look through and see if there are any other descries. Otherwise this a great cookbook.\n\nhjs"
1	"First you have to look in the dictionary almost like a paper dictionary, meaning you can't look for a word by typing it.\nSecond of all, and much worse: it haves a very poor vocabulary.\nIll stick to wordreference online"
1	"Essentially the same story over and over.  Nothing really original here.  No character development and no plot.  Don't waste your time."
3	'I did learn about the man behind some things he created, but other than that I\nwas not so impressed.'
3	'This is a good item, I love it and easy to use on my kindle. I always try new recipes'
2	'I should have looked up the definition of "steampunk". Science fiction has never been a favorite genre of mine and this book falls into that category.\n\nI wasn\'t able to separate myself from the genre enough to enjoy this book. The characters seemed to be true and well-developed. But unforunately, this was like reading a foreign language.'
2	"Not too crazy about this book. I have read better. Story was dragged on and on. I couldn't connect with the characters. It just something was missing for me"
1	"This book was painful. It was one dramatic scene after another and not in a good way - in a high school, immature way. The characters weren't likable. I tried skimming because I'm not one to give up ...but ultimately even that was too painful.\nThere was little true to life happenings in regards to the industry or even drug trafficking. It felt like a teenagers interpretation of the struggles in making it big.\nI hope the author's other works have more to offer because I recommend avoiding this particular title."
3	"Umm I don't really know where to start. I thought the program is stupid with all of these rules. Brent is a jerk and doesn't bend at all. Gideon gave up to soon and with communication so messed up its hard. Jenna was a mix for me she was put through the ringer and at times I was passed for her. I liked that Gideon got off his high horse and acknowledged his feelings."
3	'I always finish a book I start, but thus was so slow! I loved Stella, and she has a huge heart! Nathan has been abused all his life and never has had love!! He was so shut off, Stella is his Angel! Cute story!! Would say, " must read" but it was ok!!'
3	'There is not enough character development for the three main characters.  The behavior of the antagonist is widely-narrated and shown so it seems like his personality is the only one that is fully-developed.  The story is likeable but very short.  Although it has an HEA, it is not enough.  [This is a voluntary honest review of a free copy.]'
1	'I work with our local comic book conventions and expected more out of this book than it gave me.  I found it to be boring.'
2	'Love all her books'
3	'Gives a short version of the actual crimes, in England, but most of the book is the statements made by the families of those murdered.  Was ok but not what I expected'
3	'Product and picture description is a bit different'
3	'Good but could put it down.'
1	"This book/story is a bit odd. I have no clue who these characters are. There is no real character development. They all (besides the 2 neighbors) sound exactly the same, like one character.\nIt is slightly entertaining for the short amount of time it took me to read it. But it left me annoyed with its abrupt and incomplete ending.\nI am glad it was free! I don't really recommend this to anyone."
3	"This story was all over the place. It skipped from one scene to the next without a lead in, leaving me confused about where I was in the story. It was just too disjointed, and it was poorly edited. Monica and Melba's characters were not  believable to me. This could have been a good story if it had flowed and was better edited."
1	'Thought, well it does have good reviews (overall).\nMaybe she has a lot of blog followers? I for one, lost my literacy skills on this simplistic "Praise the Lord" book.\nHad NOTHING of value to real humans.'
1	'I had considered purchasing this historic classic by Arthur S. Peake, until I looked inside. Horrible job by the publisher. I would not and cannot recommend anyone to purchase this horribly formatted work.'
2	'Lame and ugly projects'
1	"I'm disappointed. I believe literature is an art form which this definitely is not. I have to wonder how many 'titles' you've spanned out to compled one single story, a simple one, at that.  Shame on you. Plus, your plot is conflictive, the son is a jerk, your H doesn't appear to be honest but then, your h has a weak character, as well. . And ya know what?...I don't care how the story ends."
3	"Novellas don't seem to do it for me as they are too short and come off unbelievable.  Trust fund babies whose parents want to rule their lives.  What starts as a farce WAY too quickly becomes real for the characters, but not enough story."
3	"All About Us is one of those stories where I really like the story itself, but the main characters can be a bit annoying because of a behavior they share in common--jumping to conclusions (the wrong ones).\n\nThe storyline is a mix of some of my favorite tropes-second chance romance (well, sort of since the main characters were only kids the first time around) and friends-to-more.  The setup was a good one and it draws you in to the story, and the characters are believable and easy to relate to.\n\nThe misunderstandings that keep undermining their relationship?  That's where the jumping to conclusions part comes in, and since both of the main characters can be a little stubborn, each time it happens it gets a bit drawn out which is where I got a little irritated.\n\nOne of the plusses was seeing the changes in Emma as she learns to work through the issues caused by the losses she's suffered.  Another is the way Dane understands her issues and helps her through them with his unconditional love and pure devotion...even if he makes a few mistakes along the way.\n\nA good, quick read for romance fans...and I think anyone who has read this will agree that you'll definitely love Alex, Emma's best friend.  I'm intrigued to read his story next!  3.5 stars for All About Us."
3	'I liked the first book better.'
3	"*** Some Spoilers*****The book was good although I did skip some pages and scanned through to finish. The book was too long and I love to read. The author had to many stories going on. I felt that Brian and Annie's relationship issues took up too much time which could've been dedicated to the aftermath of Luke and Jesse's relationship and so forth. Annie was my least favorite character. Also, the secrets that Natalie kept, especially a secret that at 14 I gave birth to your child, will leave you wondering and questioning the relationship. Its unbelievable to keep a secret that big especially when the father of the child is your husband. After they found each other again would've been the perfect time. To use the excuse of possibly being like his abusive father was not enough for me. Overall, it wasn't a bad book. I would suggest to read if you like a lot of twists and turns. It will definitely leave you surprised in some areas."
1	"This book is complete trash and you really should think about\nremoving it. Even the language is foul to say nothing of the\nrape of Holmes and Watson's chararacters. Disgusting.\n\nBro David Owen"
1	'Poorly written or translated.  The characters don\'t act realistically. What mother would go to bed after her son was mIssing, presumably kidnapped by a psychopath and get up and as her boyfriend " do you want coffee"?\n\nThe characters were not believable. Would not recommend.'
2	"This book has a sequel, but I don't think I'll even bother.  It is just not that good.  The story is not very well written, in my opinion."
2	'A meh follow up to a fun first novel.'
1	"Couldn't get into it"
1	"I was so excited to see a new story come out, I didn't realize it was a novella.  It was a very short story and I strongly feel like it was not worth $2.99.  You get some background on Abe and his story. It took about an hour to read. Abe got fooled by the President's motives and realized his mistake.  Your welcome;-)"
2	'This was a little slow for me, not enough action.'
3	"35 Italian Recipes For Your Slow Cooker - Fabulous Italian Meals and Italian Cuisine (The Slow Cooker Meals And Crock Pot Recipes Collection)\nNo pictures and no nutritional information.  Some of the recipes to cook in your slow cooker are very intense and would take some time to prepare, a few are easy.\nI think I could substitute some ingredients to make the meal more healthy but Italians don't concern themselves with that. This might be the once a month meal for us."
3	"Not an easy read.  I'm a reader so if I start something I definitely try to complete.  My daughter and I were both reading it and she was having a difficult time staying very interested and following the pattern."
3	'It was an okay book.  Not exactly what I prefer in a paranormal romance book.  Had some great sections and a wonderful ending, but had trouble getting through the book.'
2	'It was a re hash of all facts that others had reported on in the past or may be it was just to slow of a  read =doesnt keep your attention....'
1	'A waste of time to read...  Nothing here of value.'
1	"If you really like the book Divergent DON'T READ THIS BOOK!!!!!"
1	'Characters not well developed. Unbelievable: who discusses things in the midst of a crisis? No resolution to the conflict. A very abrupt ending.'
1	"The storyline was good.  However, I'm sick to death of these sequels so the author can get more money from the readers.  The storyline is just never that good with these and it's very irritating."
2	"Couldn't finish it.... was like reading a romance novel... slow and boring!"
3	"This was an interesting read. I really grew to like Rich and Penny. They both go through so much, before they met and after. This story pulls you into their drama. Lots of mystery as\nTo why they're being chased. I gave it three out of five stars, because of the ending, which was a major cliff hanger. One good thing is, the next book should be coming out soon."
1	'Very short, poorly written and edited.'
3	'Whoever assembled the kindle version created a hot mess! About every third page is photocopied. When you go to the next page you are either missing paragraphs or having to re-read paragraphs. VERY FRUSTRATING.\nThe story line was good but hard to follow with the disastrous conversion from print to electronic format.'
3	'very quick read.  Cute'
2	'I was not impressed with this series. I only read a few pages of book one and I stopped. I love to read but there was nothing that captured my interest in the beginning to keep it. Maybe I watch too many crime shows and strange people creeping into houses is not appealing.'
1	'The reason I say that this is teerible is because there are parts of 3 different books mixed in together and I was really getting into crash dive when it started another book. P Offed with this one.'
1	'Too many suspects to keep track of, too many details'
3	'I liked the premis of this story, but the writing was predictable, which made it a bit boring. I kept feeling like I was missing something or waiting for something to happen. Then it ended. Not really interested in the next installment.'
2	"The book was pretty good to start with, but quickly became repetitive. It wasn't bad enough to quit reading it so I kind of skimmed the repetitive parts. Then the book ended right in the middle of the story. I went ahead and bought the 2nd book because the first book had been free. The second half was about the same as the first half. By about the three-quarters mark I was pretty fed up with the heroine's lack of self confidence and back-and-forth decisions. Since I had already invested the time to get to that point, I went ahead and finished the book.\n\nI gave it 2 stars because it had a couple of really hot sex scenes, but that was about all I could manage to find to recommend the book."
3	'I read the first 3 books in day this one took me almost a week. The book dragged a little there was too many details about Viceroy and Rodney Rudmann and the oil business.  Also there were too many storylines left open. I get that Noire wants us to read her next book but the way book 4 dragged it makes you think is it even worth reading the next book.'
1	'I started skimming at 47% and gave up completely at 90%. This book was sooooo boring and bland. It was like riding a rollercoaster with no drops, no turns and no speed. The dialogue had enough sugar to give me diabetes and the "conflict "didn\'t feel like conflict to me at all. It seemed nothing more than an excuse for the h and H to meet rather than a chance encounter. The writing wasn\'t bad, grammar was fine but I was very aware that I was reading a made up story because I was not buying the emotions of the characters or even the seriousness of the whole "beloved " mats being targeted. I was too busy rolling my eyes and cringing at the teeth gnashing blandness if this book. This may seem a bit harsh but I forked out money for this book so yeah, no holding back. Definitely won\'t be purchasing another from the author. I like to be immersed in the book due to the author\'s flow and creativity with words and plot twist. That\'s not what happened here. I was told a story. Anyone can tell a story, its an author\'s job to bring it to life.'
2	'This is a okay book I wanted to read more about Autumn and Blake getting together because they seem to be a good couple'
1	"this game was terrible i got the sample and it stunk i thought it would be a two player game never get this  game i rate it 0stars but it wouldnt let me  well bottom line= don't buy this  worst game ever d: hi"
3	'There are a LOT of ads and, for a magazine called "Amazing Wellness" I expected more holistic articles and ads.  Ads for Sensa and other quick weight losss products aren\'t about wellness.'
3	"Wasn't the best book I've read, but it was okay.  Was switching back and forth between the characters .  Sometimes hard getting into the book."
2	'I was not expecting a graphic novel. It is impossible toes clearly on my Kindle'
3	"Wow! I enjoyed part 2 but it was too short for comfort. I am happy I don't have to wait for part 3 to be released unless I will be really upset......"
3	"This is a cyberpunk caper chiefly viewed through the eyes of the protagonists cybernetic implants.\n\nIt is an inventive idea, which builds on the idea of Internet connected gadgets that will soon be upon us.\n\nThere was something about the narrative structure which did not grip me however. The plot hangs on a conspiracy the reason behind which is never explained.\n\nIf this is the author's first book it shows a promising start."
3	'Not the greatest thriller, but OK.'
1	'I have been unable to download the document so will defer my review until I can do so.\n\nAdditional information otherwise provided didn\'t work either as the "Fire" refuses to recognize my wi-fi connection although it is clearly displayed on the "Fire" but only says, "Saved".'
1	'Really disappointed in this book. Did not captivate my attention and was overall cheesy, even if if is written for a younger audience.'
1	'I do not like the fact that you are forced to purchase this cloud viewer with the book.. TOTALY STUPID'
1	'Not as good as I thought it was going to be.  I think you have to already be familiar with their storyline, or something.  I felt very left out and the entertainment value for me was zero.'
3	'I saw the full page ad on the Sunday Business section on July 14th and had to have it.  I had been wondering how to get the Times on my Kindle since I got it in mid-May.  I am not so tech savvy, so I had issues, which I attribute solely to me.  The other issue for me will be whether I will have to subscribe through Kindle or whether I can continue to use my home delivery subscription for the Kindle/Times app.  But so far I really enjoy having the paper at my fingertips.  Much easier to read on the subway to work.'
1	'I truly doubt that the photos were of actual items baked. Coconut flour is very dense and items do not raise much with it, so the puffy muffins shown in photos I would bet are not photos of actual recipes. Nice try, but not an honest representation.'
2	"A bit dull. Felt like a rushed romance rather than a short and sweet love story with a beginning, middle and end. To much character building for a short story and sexy scenes didn't feel very immersive and/or real."
2	'short and to the point. basically he describes his struggle with sitting still meditating and ends with a lesson on a moving meditation'
1	'almost unreadable. Pictures useless. Most disappointed.  Slightly better on my iPad mini,  But on my paper white , dreadful.'
3	'I\'ve read all the Lexi Graves books and I\'m not sure I\'ll read any more of them. I loved them and couldn\'t wait to read all of them. I have to say I probably won\'t pay to read the next one. Early on in the series there was intrigue, romance, sex appeal, plus humor. That all was non-existent in the #6 book " Laugh or Death." You can pass on that one. This one was better - better plot, lots of characters. However, no romance, no sex appeal, little fun. Lexi does her thing, and if all you want is a mystery to figure out, this one will be entertaining - not great, but entertaining. Don\'t know why it all went down hill with the romance, sex and humor, but, for me at least, it has. Sad to say it.'
3	"This was a good story but the back and forth texts were confusing and half the time I didn't know who was talking.  Maybe the formatting could have set these apart in a better way???  I read both books and the storyline is good but its very confusing to read.  Great idea, but the formatting of the book just doesn't lend itself to make this easily readable."
3	'Lots and lots of mistakes. Kinda takes away from the story.  Seems like the author is rushing threw. Hopefully the next one is better.'
3	'The storyline was easy to follow.  The length of the comic was well worth it.  The graphics were old school, but they were good.'
3	"I like Dimitri a lot but Derry not so much. The book is constant sex with very little romance or back story. I am a big fan of Jordan Silver's and almost always give a 5 star review. I will read the second book to follow this story to see how it ends. :)"
3	'I was, as usual, looing for an edge to improve my sprinting technique\nand my coaching skills.\n\nThere are a lot of options for the sprint start, and many experts, so to have\na comparison of two different styles in one book (at a reasonable price)was too good to resist.\n\nThere is a bit about different body types and strenght so you have to use your own experiences as to what\napplies to whom.  The final analysis is not totally clear but an experienced coach or\ncompetitor will work it out.\n\nIn reality it is hard to make a change but there are a number of differences that can be applied\nto improve on your current style.  I particularly made use of the acceleration pickup at 20m which earned me\na silver in a recent World Titles competition (giving away 8yrs and one metre to the winner).\n\nSo, use it, or at least try it.  Nothing to lose.'
3	'Good read. Analogies could be drawn to various aspects of business and competitive strategies if read with some thought process.'
3	'I ride a tadpole trike myself so I have some interest in the subject. I thought that the auther was kind of negative.'
2	'This book unfortunately was not a good read, some grammatical errors, elementary writing, no depth, missing pieces. It has all the components of a fairly good book but falls flat. The book needs development'
3	'Carly has hit upon very hard times, but upon her returning home she finds her parents have it much harder than she could have ever guessed. Darren has a goal but has it changed sincerely or is he trying to renegotiate the terms of the possible agreement. No certain plot as of yet but I thing it is being worked on.'
2	"This story was so poorly edited that I can't even tell you if it had a good premise.  It was so poorly edited, in fact, that it wasn't the least bit erotic.  In addition to that, it was *extremely* short, taking me maybe five minutes to read from beginning to end.  Punctuation was barely an afterthought, and spelling and grammar were atrocious.\n\nI noticed when looking it up to write the review that there are two more parts.  I'm not even remotely interested in reading them, even if they're free.  This author seriously needs a beta reader, at the very least."
2	'Maybe good for a younger person. I was looking for the next step. Maybe how to find better opportunities for the next chapter in life.'
3	'A free copy of this book was provided to me by the author for a fair and honest review.  This book is the first of a three book series: Shifters and Lovers.  It was a pleasant read, but the brevity of the story eliminated its depth.  There was much room for character and plot development.  Essentially you meet the MCs, they quickly solve the problem at hand then instant HEA.  I have already recommended this book to a friend who was looking for what he called a quick read.  The book has good bones though and it definitely showcases the authors talent.  If Ali Atwood were to rewrite this story with better plot development, I would buy and read it without reservation.'
1	"It won't let me download it:(please explain. I have been wanting to read it. It has been like this for several other books too. Help. That is the reason I am giving it one star."
1	'Is this about Jaime Frasier in purgatory and Claire? I have yet to read these books,however I must  say that I am very curious. Sounds like it maybe a different series of Outlander.'
1	"Impossible to read on a small kindle screen because it is mostly images. Even the writing, which isn't high quality, is a party of the images making it impossible to search and impossible to increase the size of the font. I was hopeful this book would work out well, and I would give it another try myself if they would format it as a real book and have an editor clean up the messy sentences. But for now, 1 star is all I can give it."
3	"I believe Piers is a wonderful human being, full of compassion for his fellow man.  His extensive 'author's notes' regarding dealings with fans have always impressed me as the mark of someone who cares deeply about others (as well as third party accounts of his kindness and charity).  I also believe Piers to be a past-master of the craft of writing.  He is well able to shorthand characteristics into as little as two or one sentences to flesh out a character.  However, I think these days he goes to an extreme on that front.\n\nI think he has an interesting idea, and develops his characterization to the exact minimum required to tell the story, resulting in characters that easily come off as one-dimensional and flat, filling in the blank of actor for the part needed to develop the plot he has in mind.  It is also rare in a Piers Anthony story for the character meant to be the central character to ultimately meet with a hard fate, thus predictability sets in. This is a set of 4 related novelettes, which, in Anthony's heyday, had they been developed into full-blown novels, would have been on a par with some his greater trilogies such as the Adept series.  In fact, I picked up and read this series because of how enamored I'd been in my youth with the concept and character of Sheen, the robot maiden from the Adept series, but in my opinion, the robot heroine of this series was a shadowy reflection of that character.\n\nWith regards to sex as depicted in the work, if you're reading for (ahem) stimulation, then I feel you'd be disappointed with this work as an example of erotica.  The characters do have sex, in several permutations in terms of positions and activities as well as combinations of partners (the heroine after all starts out as a sex toy), but the actual descriptions are as clinical and outlines as one might imagine, as though from written notes for the story to final draft, little was added.  The author leaves the reader to fill in the blanks, I suppose, and that's fine if you're reading for the sake of how the plot is going to work out.  It has always been as if Piers has wanted to write his characters as real sexual beings, with varied desires and interests, and gives them permission to do the deeds, but then the text looks out the window while they engage.  If you're a longtime fan of Piers, you'll be used to this by now.  New readers should be more interested in the plot than the sticky stuff, if you're searching for a new author.\n\nI certainly mean no disrespect to the author.  He has provided me with many happy hours of reading over my lifetime, and I would heartily recommend the vast majority of his works, especially the Adept series, the Incarnation of Immortality series, and the early volumes of Xanth (you'll know when it's time to stop).  I simply do not feel that the Metal Maiden Collection is in the same caliber as these efforts."
1	'I am grateful that I could get a sample of this book on my kindle before making the mistake of buying it. I\'m a sucker for any Byronic hero love story (aka Beauty and the Beast), but there is no way I could read through this book. It reads like a poor first draft of a novel, not as a publishable work. A previous reviewer suggests the author may not have access to a thesaurus, but I think the opposite is true. This "book" is an example of what happens when a writer makes an attempt to diversify or elevate their writing by playing thesaurus roulette. This is a mistake. Always. Add to that the lack of transition, the flawed point of view, and the inappropriate jumps in logic, timing, and setting and this book is more than just awkward; it is downright unreadable. Editors serve a purpose, and this author needs to either fire hers or hire one that is not imaginary. The idea behind this novel is a good one, but the execution is lacking. I will continue to search for a good reinvention of the beauty and the Beast story, this wasn\'t it.'
3	'The best thing I can say about this, is that it is short. I get that people were frantic about Twinkies going away and they wanted to share their story but the Twinkies are back.  I think it was a marketing ploy on the part of Hostess.  These are short stories and I have never been a fan of short stories.'
3	'Took a long time to wade thru this one. Too many characters and acronyms for my taste!'
1	"Formatting was awful and the story was so slow.  Didn't feel any real chemistry between the characters, if anything it felt forced. For me  Jessica was not likeable at all and just a terrible person to Eric. I found her extremely annoying and not a strong female character. Eric was a big push over and didn't like the whole pulling out move instead of using protection. The ending was rushed and after finishing the book I was left feeling very disappointed."
3	'I bought this book because I love friends-to-lovers and GFY themes. While I enjoyed some parts of the book, others I felt were incomplete. I just didn\'t "feel" the friendship between the two guys before they became lovers since the book started with them hooking up, not with showing the reader how and why they were friends. I felt that was a missed opportunity. Overall, a cute little read, but it won\'t go in my favorites file.'
3	'a very short book about international dumplings. I was hoping that the recipes would have paid more attention to the recipes for the dumpling skins instead of "a package of wonton skins". But it said it right in the title "Easy!!! Dumpling Recipes" and they are. They are also good recipes. I think that I was expecting too much'
1	'Couldn\'t get into it.  Anyone working in the candy industry for a long time that I have ever met doesn\'t eat much if any.  Also, the main character is all over the place - one minute she doesn\'t know how to respond to a feisty old lady, the next second she describes the old lady as "her kind of woman".  Then it turns out the old lady is the mother-in-law of her supposed best friend since grade school - yet she doesn\'t even know her name!  It was too choppy for me, with the main character rather unpleasant.  I mean, who would put maple bacon fudge on the backseat with her dog when she was planning to sell it?  I would recommend this author to read M. M. Kaye\'s Death in... series to get a feel for descriptive passages and letting the action tell the story.  In fact, I would recommend that series to anyone, as well as anything else she wrote!'
3	'I selected the book for to main reasons 1) Im a quilter and 2) I love genealogy. I was hoping that I had found a book that would have combined my passions. I found it difficult to follow the snippets of various peoples lives as the book traversed the ages. I nearly gave up on the book but was glad that I stuck it out to the end. The last 20% of the book was the best part.'
1	'Really unbelievable characters and poor plotting.'
3	"This pretty much was a PWP M/M smut short. A guy gets 'ASSisted' from a tow-truck driver and they carry on with being friends with benefits.\n\nNot a horrible short by any means but not the most stellar either."
3	"This book shows Lily's background and why and how she is doing what she is doing. Then the book continues where the first book finished. A lot of action again in this book some great sex. Yet again the twist at the end surprised me! I was not expecting that to happen! A really great second book! Now on to the third to see what else Le Carre has up her sleeve."
1	'I love fairytale spinoffs, but this was a wasted book that I could not even finish. It was trashy erotica. Even if you like porn, do not waste your time with this book.'
1	"Save your 99 cents!  This comes across as a poorly written High School term paper badly in need of a proof reader!  Just one example:  After referring to another author's opinion statement, the writer fails to tell you what that statement WAS!  A waste of time altogether."
2	'Poor ending to a hard to undersand novel.'
3	"The book was just fair it was very predictable  it is more of a chic flick book I wouldn't. recommend it"
3	"This story is back-to-front.  I thought it was finished and was about to relegate the story to my kindle archives when I flipped a page and discovered more.  And more.  And more.\n\nThe writer tries to do something different, plot-wise, earlier on - the transition is a bit clumsy.  But overall, the writing style and editing are good, the dialogue flows easily.  The characters' personalities were a little cold but this was, probably, in their natures."
2	'I have never been so sick of "I Love You" and "You are so beautiful" in my life! They said it in every damn sentence! The whining from the main character drove me insane right a long with the story. It had great potential to be a very good story but it failed about 30% in. Predictable and annoying!! Read at your own risk!'
1	'so many typos and so many jumbled paragraphs jumping from one character to another it is not worth time spent ticking pages.'
1	"Laurette, Laurie, Allen is a New Orleans Southern Bell, who in secret rides horses astride and in pants, has fencing lessons and is a spoiled Daddy's girl.

After roaming Texas, Cade comes home to his Grandfather's hacienda and tries to make his Grandfather proud.\n\nBoth Laurie and Cade are in Higuero now, and their worlds will collide into a passionate and toe curling kisses at the Don Benito fiesta. They are interrupted by his Grandfather and Laurie flees the party with Don Benito's help. Higuero has a evil and cruel alcade (mayor/tax collector), Don Luis, who takes all the citizens money for unfair taxes and puts it in his bank account. No one challenges him or his soldiers until a masked hero with a black cape rides his black horse into town and begins to steal from the evil Don Luis and gives it back to the poor via the church. Soon this Robin Hood hero has a name, El Vengador (The Avenger) and now Don Luis wants to capture, whip and hopefully kill this El Vengador. Laurie can rides astride and can fence with the best of them. Cade rides like the wind and fencing is in his blood. Who is the masked hero?\n\nThis story had great characters and a terrific plot, but got off track with different locals and random new people. Cade kidnaps and uses Laurie sexually in angry. Violence and sex don't mix and even thou Laurie gave in sometimes it still bothered me. I have to give this book and score of 1 fingers up and 3 toes.\n\nNetGalley ARC given for my honest review."

1	"Worst writing I've seen in a long time, and apparently neither edited nor proof-read. The author appears to have used a Thesaurus to find words that he does not know how to use.\nNot worth the $.99 cost."
2	'If there\'s one thing I really don\'t like when I\'m reading a book, it\'s reading in the present tense.  Not just the first person, but in the present tense "she sits in the car watching...." that\'s what I\'m talking about, and the whole book is written like that.  The story was okay, I\'ve read other books by this author that were better, but I read it to the end because it held my attention and I wanted to find out who the killer was.  I overcome this present tense writing by reading it in the past tense.  I\'ve gotten quite good at it.  The sentences were short and choppy - not sure if this was due to being written in the present tense, but the editing was poor -there were spelling errors as well as words missing, and incorrect use of identical words such as "to and too" - not that those were the words that were misused, but just to give you an idea of what I\'m talking about. Again, as I\'m finding in all the books she writes, I was surprised at the ending, didn\'t see it coming, and that\'s what I like most about her stories.  This one had something in the ending that upset me - not sure why she felt it was necessary to do what she did to one of the characters - now I feel compelled to read the rest of the books in this group to see if this particular innocent character has a surprise outcome.  It made me cry - and I don\'t always feel as sympathetic towards humans  as I do towards animals, so Ms Rose gets another plus for that.  Her stories are suspenseful and do keep me on the edge of my seat, and for me, the endings are always a surprise, so for now, I\'ll continue to read her books.'
3	'very quick read.'
3	'This was a good, clean read with a rather predictable storyline. It was an easy read and the characters were likeable. Like some of the other reviewers have mentioned, I thought the author spent a little too much time talking about wine. It seemed like she had a wine fixation. It got a little old after a while. This is part of a series, but it can be read as a stand-alone book.'
3	'The recipes look easy, but not completely healthy ingredients. Definitely try to substitute healthier ingredient options in to make them whole food recipes.'
1	'This book spent an enormous amount of words to say absolutely nothing. The writer spent alot of time reading previous books on the topic and spitting out quotes without any conclusions being made or any new information being given.\nAn absolute waste of time.'
1	"When trying to edit notes or diary entries on my Kindle Keyboard, there's no way to move the cursor within the text I've already entered. It ignores the five-way controller, so if I want to make a change to something ten words back, I have to delete backwards, removing all ten words, make the change, and then retype the ten words.\n\nAlso, the Sym button is ignored when editing notes or diary entries, so the only punctuation available is the period.\n\nIt's really unusable like this. I hope the developers can fix these things."
1	'Whenever I can\'t finish a book I automatically give it a one star rating. This book was a struggle to get to the 50% mark. I like to give a book until 50% before I really decide that I just can\'t finish it.\n\nLet\'s start with the obvious. The formatting is wrong. The kindle version is double spaced with skipped lines between paragraphs. Really. There are a million typographical errors. There are a million grammatical errors. There are tons of formatting errors. The word "atheist" should not be capitalized. I would suggest getting a good copy editor but this book needs much more than that.\n\nJust as fundamentally, the author does not seem to know what a novel is. A novel is not just an exposition of your ideas put into the mouths of nominal characters. There has to be a STORY. The story has to be compelling. There have to be character arcs. There has to be suspense. There have to be scenes and sequels. There needs to be action and tension. The story has to be shown and not told. And it has to be believable at some level. The reader has to connect to the characters enough so that he/she cares about them. None of this happens in this book.\n\nThere are many good novels out there about religion/atheism. I would suggest that the author read some of those to get an idea of how it is done within the context of a novel. Maybe start with Cat\'s Cradle by Kurt Vonnegut.'
3	'I agree with another reviewer that what happened to Duncan and how that went down was just not necessary. After reading that scene I came up with three alternatives to how that could have gone down while still keeping the other parts there if required. It was just so not required and there was no need to shove down our throat just how uncaring the demons are to others. Not impressed at all. I also feel that the ending was all over the place and a lot was just left and I understand that there will be a 3rd book but honestly it should matter as it really was just left and then something totally unrelated ended the book. I enjoyed the other series that led into this one a lot more than this one and the first which is a shame as there is such a rich field here to play with (witches, elves dwarfs, werewolves). Not happy'
1	'Learning zentangle?......not from this self aggrandizing fraudulent book..I want my money back!  No option for negative star.  This book sucks.'
1	'I waited months after the due to published date for this book only to be so confused about who, what, when, why ...  This is the time I have reviewed a kindle book Jon does not acknowledge his son and what was the scene with Sofia being hugged from behind ... like a husband might do and her saying something about telling this guy\'s wife about "them"? The last one third of the book was horrible.  I wish the author would rewrite ... again ... what was there was very, very disappointing.'
3	'This book has information of value to all pilots, real or virtual and, in my opinion, is worth reading. The author leverages his experience as a flight instructor to provide a lot of practical advice. It has a folksy, almost conversational style, like having the instructor in the cockpit with you.  However, I found that it was rough around the edges.  Basically, not a finished professional product.  It would benefit from the services of an editor and proof reader and properly reproduced charts.\n\nA few things could have been explained better.  One example is a chart showing the TUCSON TWO standard instrument departure.  The author spends little time explaining this very complicated chart (for a beginner, which I am not), saying the chart is self explanatory -- it was not.  I found the resolution of some of the charts and graphics low or even blurry -- almost unreadable in the case of that particular chart.  Yet other graphics, such as the pictures of flight instruments were excellent. The Wichita, Kansas, ILS Runway One Right Approach Plate chart, for example, was explained much more thoroughly than TUCSON TWO.\n\nAnother thing explained quite well was how the pitot tube and static vent work and how they are affect by altitude.\n\nIn a few cases, there was unnecessary repetition.\n\nI liked the sections where flying an actual approach was described, presumably so the reader (at least the virtual pilot) could try it out and experience first hand the point of the lesson, such as situational awareness or flying a back course approach.  The section on holding patterns seemed very thorough and complete.\n\nThe book ended suddenly, seemingly at a place where one would have expected more material. I was left wanting more.. Overall, I learned quite a bit from this book but felt it could have been put together better and could have contained more material.'
1	'This is the third book I have recently purchased for my Kindle that has the most irritating writing style I have ever encountered. It purports to take place in England (going on vocabulary). The leading character is very childish, the action never quite takes off, and the inclusion of all the strange characters (apparently just for the sake of oddity) just kills my interest in it.'
1	"Can't say if the book is good or bad because it's quadruple spaced and impossible to read!!!"
3	"I thought that this suffered from being just a bit short.  Things just seemed to happen and maybe some more book space in development might have been worth it.  For example, the 'mentor' figure seemed quite inappropriately cruel - surely there was a reason for this, or not, who knows?  However, without development of that character, it just seemed (to me) to make the story a little less believable, whereas if I had known the reason why the character was the way he was, it would have improved the story for me.\n\nWorth trying a sample."
2	"Well, I finished the book - as I do with every book I start, no matter if I enjoy it or not. Needless to say that this book gave me a really hard time to finish it. The plot lacked seriously and didn't create suspense or entertainment. The main characters were very sketchily described, with the background information referring to them limited to the absolute minimum. The dialogues between the hero/ine were ridiculous and irrational. Finally, having suffered through the book, I really expected to be rewarded with a nice and cheesy happy end. But no - the ending was rushed and without any atmosphere at all. Sorry, can't recommend this one."
3	'The Kindle subscription edition is good. Not great. The convenience is 5 star.\n\nSome complaints.\n* My recent Sunday edition did not include my beloved Arts & Entertainment section.\n* Too many missing articles compared to the paper/digital edition\n* Photos have only a remote relationship to the article. And, many times, the photo captions include editorial notes not intended for publication.\n* Why not publish the comics as individualized selections. For example, I love Family Circus, Peanuts and Dennis the Menace. There should be a way to select which comics to display.\n\nThe Kindle edition compared to the paper edition is lacking, but the convenience and price are excellent.'
2	"I haven't heard this version of the end for humans so I did enjoy the unique idea of it.  However it was much too short and I didn't feel any sort of investment in the character or storyline.  It had the possibilities of a great story and instead just left me feeling empty."
3	"Wasn't that impressed with the message it was putting forth. Pretty common sense approach to marketing. Hoped to garner more exciting innovative ideas."
2	'This is one of the most nihilistic books I\'ve read in a long, long time. I grew up in the area and era where this story takes place. Poverty abounded. Many people were "religious",  but people weren\'t cruel the way there were depicted in this book. I too went hungry, gleaned the fields, scoured the dumps, had a father who was a drunk, slept in church, walked everywhere because we didn\'t have a car (let alone a bus), but physical abuse and cruelty weren\'t common attributes among the members of our small, close-knit community. I found this story extremely disturbing and not at all a realistic depiction of life in the late 40s and early 50s in the Indiana where I grew up. Very little to recommend in this book.'
3	"It left me hanging , I guess i will need Mysterious Touch 2 now , i hate that , i didn't know it was a series !! DANG ! Not a bad story though !"
3	"I've read every novel in the Andy Hall/Jane Francis series and for me this installment was pedestrian - just a so-so read."
3	"Lennox is clumsy and funny.  Running from an abusive ex, she is struggling with emotional trauma.  Vic is handsome, dominating, and shows bipolar tendencies.  They seem so well suited for each other, appearing to balance one another, but Im not sure why I couldn't connect with them.\n\nI struggled to get into the story at the beginning but then it started to move faster toward the middle and then I found myself more engaged.\n\nThere were twists, turns, and moments where I laughed at the banter between Lennox and Vic and also between Lennox and her friends.  This made me enjoy the story.  The storyline was interesting, but more character development was needed.  I also needed to see more about their backstories.\n\nThis is the authors debut and I see so much potential for the next book."
3	'Starts off slow but right after I complained about its pace, things really took off. Then it slowed down again, and then sped up again. Uneven. But you care about the characters and want to know what happens to them.'
3	'Halloway, Trevor.  Ashes and Asphalt\nHalloways story of two brothers carrying out their mission to deliver their fathers ashes to the Sturgis rally in South Dacota has a certain tension, time being of the essence.  Many challenges need to be overcome en route before their task in complete, such as being pursued by a trio of armed robbers, not to mention the road police and machine breakdown.\n\nThis story of their 2,000 mile journey is told by an omniscient narrator, whose prose rattles along at the speed of their machines and is larded with the same tough vernacular as the speech of the brothers Kyle and Mike.  The verbs grabbed, jerked roared and exploded are used not only for bar brawls but for such mundane activities as looking in a mirror or opening a bottle of the amber liquid.\n\nBut the story doesnt lack pace and has about it a kind of Boys Own innocence.  The heroes we know from the start are good lads, loved their father and attempt to live up to his sterling principles, such as a punch on the jaw being an honest mans answer.  Good clean fun if you like this kind of thing.'
1	'Two or three pages and I ran into filthy language -- one thing I will not read are books with filthy language. The authors who write like that remind me of teenagers trying to impress their buddies. They should be ashamed of themselves for putting that type of language in public literature domain.'

3	'This book has great information but the website is no longer up. I wonder if the author is as suggested as she claims.  There are some websites that she list that are helpful. Even without the website still a good read'
2	"It's not anything exceptional.  The recipes are ones that you can find online for basic vegetarian eating."
1	'This is too general to be of interest. None of the suggestions are original. Not worth your money. Better buy Lonely Planet or similar.'
1	'It was ok for me but it was not even enough so I wish I was not quiet what I was looking for.'
3	'I\'ve just downloaded the book tonight, and haven\'t tried using any of the recipes, so I can\'t speak to their quality. But the first recipe is London Broil, an American recipe, not a British one, akin to starting a "French" cookbook with the recipe for American French Fries. You have to wonder what else is less that authentic. Or perhaps there needs to be better explanation of what is meant by English.'
3	'It was an okay read'
3	'Four Jokers and a Queen can be best described as a novelette, but it reads like a converted script/screenplay. The story focuses on two detectives Max and Molly as they uncover a series of murders involving stand-up comedians. The prose is choppy and sometimes switches tense, but it is more readable than a lot of indie eBooks out there.\n\nThere\'s enough police jargon to keep fans of the genre interested, but the entry is far from perfect. One-dimensional secondary characters, a lack of description within short-short chapters, and the occasional sprinkling of adult language makes "Four Jokers" feel as if it was an episode of a television cop show. (Or worse, an episode of a parody of a television cop show).\n\nRecommended if you are a crime/mystery junkie, but there\'s nothing groundbreaking here.\n\n*I received a free copy of this book for my review. *'
2	'I received this book as an ARC in exchange for an honest review. Since I did receive it for free, I feel bad not giving it all 5 stars and a glowing review. I\'ve absolutely LOVED all of Christina\'s work up to this point. However, I was disappointed in the final book of the the Uleash Me series.\n\nFirst, I didn\'t understand the need to add the plot twist that was the church cult. To be honest, I felt uncomfortable reading the part of the story where Lisa was with them. We were left waiting in suspense wondering "who done it" with Kevin and Marco (who had personal motivation to endanger Lisa) but we got stuck with crazy church people in the end. Second, I did not like Lisa in this book. Her internal dialogue was obnoxious at times and whinny at others. I know Christina worked very hard on this book and I am not belittling her efforts, I am just staying my opinions.\n\nI am looking forward to Anihilate Me Vol 2 and I love the cliffhanger in this book that let\'s us know where we will begin the next adventure.'
1	'It a good book but I want to read more about this book. I mean it was good until the end of the book.'
3	'The first book was good the secong and third book was boring . She left a lot of  details out of these last to book unless it was sex she was talking bout . Briana is very childish in the beginning  I started skipping pages'
2	'I have to wonder if the reviews I read before buying this book were friends and family of the author, because I have a hard time believing so many people would give this book such glowing reviews. I felt very mis-lead.\n\nThis is what I would have wanted to know before buying this book:\n1.) The formatting for the Kindle was pretty bad. That might not bother everyone, but after a while it irritated me.\n2.) The writing level is beginner. The author may have potential, and it was obvious she was really trying, but that was part of the problem: how obvious she was trying. Instead of "She said, \'....\' Elly and every other character chuckled, smiled, grinned, etc. Instead of getting in her car she "hopped and jumped," among others.\n3.) The plot is very thin (see #2). If you really want something with magic in it, or the paranormal, this book is not for you. It doesn\'t even rise to the level of "Bewitched."\n\nOn the positive side, I liked the idea of a "Mystic Cafe" and cooking magic into the patrons\' food. The concept has a lot of possibilities, including hazardous and comedic situations, that could provide more depth to both the plot and the characters. I hope the author continues to work with this, and with experience her writing will improve.'
3	'There are approx. thirty sex positions described and encourage to try. The book assumes hetero (M,F) couple. Includes which positions may be more pleasurable for M or F. Drawback no photos or drawings. Illustrations needed to convey mood and how to.'
3	"Like all pulp writers of his age and times there are things that grate. There is certainly a casual racism that is part of the background and is sometimes annoying. Also sometimes trying to use Shakespearean language does not help.\nStill the author writes a good story and will try to write it from a race that is not Anglo-Saxon. He also gives a voice to women that makes them not victims and props to be rescued. I liked the stories and I liked the settings on the whole. They reminded me of the many of the adventure writers of this time. So if you want to lose a couple of hours with some historical tales and romances then these are okay. Don't expect literary gems and just go with the flow."
2	"It won't let me read the book so I have nothing to put as a review for this hopefully after this I can read it"
2	'Not well written. Scattered memoirs - not a cohesive biography'
1	'Didnt like it at all. Glad it was free. This should be taken down for lack of depth in the characters. Very predictable. No stars.'
1	"Doesn't move forward.. Wasn't engaging or interesting.. Waste of time reading.. Do not recommend it....  Far fetched and ridiculous . Boring"
1	'I usually LOVE this series and I have been *waiting* for this book.  SO disappointed!  I don\'t understand all the positive reviews.  This would have been a great book if it were not for Maggie.  I found her utterly ANNOYING.  How can ANYONE be that insecure????  Her constant stuttering as she tried to "decide" who she should be with and the guilt she felt being with Kor??  Really??  Is anyone this pathetic????  Let\'s see, be with someone who loves and cares for me or be with someone who barely tolerates me and makes me feel bad about myself???  What a hard decision.  Ugh!  I loved Kor except he shoulda let Maggie GO because I think he deserves A LOT better.  I am returning this book and I am hoping the next one is better!!!'
3	'This is just the beginning of what appears to be a serialized story. It only aludes to an interesting premise of something that happens on a holodeck that is being beta tested. Which pretty much means the story can go anywhere.\n\nI want to compliment the author on writing something with better grammar and spelling than many other books that I\'ve seen listed here. It flows decenlty and appears to have been thought out and edited well, but not perfectly.\n\nThat being said...it starts out rather stiff and reads like a high school research paper. The company does this. The building looks like this. The character looks like this. And so on. I was not fond of the separation from one section to the next; The Company, The Task, The Room. They look like outline headings. And conversations were written too formally. Not very many people speak without using contractions. "It has not happened yet, but it is always there..." Hasn\'t and it\'s are more likely to be said. And the conversations are a bit stiff too. If you fleshed it out it would read more like two people talking and it would read easier.\n\nOverall, not a bad start. I recommend that you keep writing as this looks to be a decent beginning. Better than many I\'ve read, but I don\'t think you\'ll get very far selling a 5 page book for 99 cents.'
3	'VERY thin book.  Large print, wide margins.  Interesting information, but this should have been published as an article, or a pamphlet.  It\'s just too small to be a "real" book.'

3	"Very good series, as I have read all 9 books in this series. Just lacks the wow factor. They are very entertaining to read, good writing, very descriptive. The room, the houses, the clothes, who cares? I don't care where they live, the clothes they wear. Needs more mystery and substance."

3	'Some interesting, if stereotyped, characters laid out for a conflict with pseudo-religious overtones.  Sadly, not enough to  interest me in buying book 2, but if you like sorcery, and demons mixed with technology, if might do for you.'
1	'I hate leaving bad reviews, but just really needed to say something after reading this. First of all, the bad grammar throughout the story is cringeworthy. I would have stopped reading but I have never started a book without finishing it, so I forced my way thru.\nTo confuse matters, just when I had accepted the bad narrative - a new chapter comes along with a different narrative... And suddenly the writing is actually good? It\'s almost like someone else stepped in and wrote a chapter. Then it switches back to the original narrative, making me wonder if it was intentionally written badly?\nAnyways... The plot has potential, but falls short. None of the characters have any substance, and  putting up with stuff like this . . .\n"They couldn\'t have walked into a trap. Well didn\'t they? Malik quivered his lips loose, being curious by Jean-Pierre\'s strange statement."\n. . . all through the book only to find an ending that is lacking any satisfaction or closure and didn\'t make any sense.'
3	"This series is just OK. Rather predictable most of the time, and the second volume with the girls side of the story is just not interesting at all. By the time you get to the last volume of the story you really don't care anymore. I did read all 3 of the trilogy, so that is why I gave it 3 stars, it kept most of my interest to actually finish."
2	'I received this book in exchange for an honest review (LoP or Lovers of Paranormal)\n\nI was looking forward to reading this book. The story looked like it would be something I\'d really enjoy reading but I found it to be disappointing overall.\n\nI did like a few aspects of the book, the idea of human with special abilities that demons want and a woman who thinks she\'s going crazy because of the shadows that only she can see.\n\nI felt that the book was too shallow? Not sure how to explain it but it didn\'t delve deeper into the character or the story. It\'s a nice short story, I wouldn\'t call it a novel or even a novella. We aren\'t told what kind of special powers she has or what she can do with it. All we know is that she\'s rare, she\'s powerful and she can see with her soul. Draven calls her a seer but I nothing of a seer-like power from her. All we read is her seeing demons in their true forms. Can she see the future? past? Predict anything? What can she do!?\n\nSince the book was so short the story was very rushed, everything happened to her quickly, she dealt with her shadows very casually? I see that she gets scared but more of like the "jump scares" or "that\'s really creepy" type of scares rather than "I\'m going crazy and I think I need to put myself into a psych ward". If she is normal like she thinks she is (especially since she\'s from a well off family, probably very sheltered) she should be going through a mental breakdown.\n\nI couldn\'t believe in the characters and I wanted more out of the story.'

This was my first Tanya Anne Crosby and while I liked the story, I found the number of punctuation and other grammatical errors distracting. I wish it had been edited better. Also, the line spacing changed multiple times throughout the book, sometimes on the same page.\nI have some retention and focusing problems, therefore editing errors such as those described can make reading difficult for me and detract from the overall story."

3	"Yes, prices and the US currency are not what they used to be, but this guy doesn't even look for a bargain.  I see what he was trying to do, go to the exact same places from the original book, and that is the interesting pare, but he doesn't check any of the hotels out on the internet before time, he doesn't buy a rail pass and he doesn't seem to plan his meals or seek out ways to save money and still eat well.  He spent way more money than I've ever spent on a two week trip to Europe.  This would scare the first time traveler into thinking you need $10,000 to take a 2 week trip."
3	'While brevity can be a real virtue in writing, there is such thing as being too brief.  This story seemed to rush to get finished, and the result is that a story with a really interesting setup falls somehow flat in the end.'

2	'I was not really impressed with this book as others in the series I have read so far.  I felt Kimber was very immature. Not real likable. Also, Jerry, the soldier in the story has a sister Starlee, very unusual name, and one of the main characters in book 5, Surrender, is also named Starlee and she is not from Aspen.  Since it is such an unusual name I would not think in a town of 250 there would be two women with that name.  I also found it sort of unbelievable that Jerry could forgive Kinber that quickly and get back together with her so fast.  But then you will need to read the story and decide if you like it or not.'

But on the other side of the ad is a man who seems able to peer inside her head and heart at will. When Jennifer knocks on his door, she is drawn into a sensual and sexual world she never knew existed\nThis book is rated XXX and is intended for MATURE AUDIENCES ONLY.\n\nAs I awoke this morning, this book review was writing itself in my head and I am now constrained to write it.  This book was recommend to me by an acquaintance who said it was better written than and is hotter than Fifty Shades.  The author, a man, is also a friend of hers.\n\nWhile I hated Grey, I have read the three Fifty Shades books four times each and was really looking forward to a better written and hotter read than they.  This book is not it.\n\nHow do I know?  Almost right off the bat I discovered a sentence that read, Its just me and her. There are days when I despair that, according to all available evidence, I am the last person in the world who remembers that verbs of being are intransitive and take the predicative nominative on either side. Hence, this sentence should read Its just she and I.\n\nLater on, its clear that the author cant keep names straight. On page one, Amandas boyfriends name is Billy, then Brandon, then back to Billy.\n\nLack of attention to details bother me.  In her first outing, Master gives Jennifer some very specific  instructions: no purse but in her coat pocket she is to carry her credit car, cell phone, and drivers license.  But not her keys.  How is she supposed to get back into her apartment? If Prussing is going to the trouble to list what she can carry, please be responsible enough to let her get back into her home.\n\nI have to wonder if this book was professionally edited. Or, as is the case with so many independently published novels, did the author rely solely on the spell check? Aside from the detail of the boyfriends name, in their telephone conversation, Master says he has light brown hair and blue eyes but when Jennifer sees his hair, its black. So it its very clear to me, the writing is actually worse in Letting Go than it is in Fifty Shades because while E. L. James also got her predicative nominatives incorrect, at least she was consistent with characters names and basic details.\n\nAnd if an author is going to claim that his writing is better than E. L. James, his writing has to be more than merely grammatically correct.  His writing would have to engage me more into the story and Prussing failed to do that. The first sexual encounter is written so clinically that I have no sense of Jennifers emotion. I was more invested in the ad on Craigs List and their email and telephone calls than I was when they were finally together. There is too much telling and not enough showing.  I didn\'t feel anything except humiliation.  Crawling on the floor naked? That is supposed to be sexually exciting?  How?\n\nComparisons with Fifty Shades are inevitable. One of the criticisms I constantly read is that Christian does not instruct Anastasia about the BDSM experience before he initiates her into it.  And yet I remember a lengthy contract they negotiate with a great many details spelled out, with many health concerns and responsibilities for both of them spelled out.\n\nWhere is this discussion about health concerns and responsibilities in Letting Go?  Because the first time Master sticks it in, he doesnt use a condom and there has been no conversation about safety, health, or prevention of pregnancy.  In 2015 that is just plain irresponsible and Fifty Shades was so much better at that detail.\n\nThroughout Letting Go the author continually refers to the Fifty Shades books so much so that I have to ask if Prussing ever actually read them because I don\'t think he did.  As do so many people who never read them, he seems to think those books are heavily into BDSM, which they are not.  it makes a couple of appearances in the first book and never enters the last two.  The Fifty Shades books are not about a Dom/sub relationship despite the mistaken belief of so many.  Even Christian admits in the second volume that Ana is no sub and if people ever had actually read the books for themselves, they would know that.\n\nI have to question how much Prussing actually knows about BDSM himself. Ive read other BDSM, not many, but some, but what is a constant theme in them is the pleasure of the woman, not her humiliation. Its clear to me, despite what Prussing seems to think, that the person who is really in charge in a BDSM relationship is the sub, because it is really all about her, not him.\n\nPrussing seems to be more concerned with humiliating Jennifer than with her pleasure.  I previously mentioned the crawling naked while blindfolded.  Master penetrates her without benefit of condom or any discussion of prevention of pregnancy.  On another occasion they visit the sex shop.  He wants her to try on fetish gear and makes her do it in the middle of the store when she would prefer to do so in the changing room.\n\nThroughout the book, Prussing consistently says what happens.  He never makes me feel why Jennifer goes along with it. He hints that she has been sexually dissatisfied in the past.  I never feel what she feels.  As a result, when I wasn\'t bored, I left this book feeling dirty, besmirched.  I didn\'t feel sexually liberated.  I felt abused.'
1	"Firstly, calling this a book is like calling a Hot Wheels a car. Amazon has this book listed as having the equivalent of 15 pages. That's not a book. That's a kind of long short story.\n\nI assume all of the 5-star reviews on here are by friends of the author because this books offers nothing of substance. It could have been written as a single list of bullet points.\n\nI understand buying a car can be intimidating but this book won't make it any better.\n\nI could go on and on about every misstep or mistake in this book but I really and truly believe its length should be enough of an indicator.\n\nIf you pay anything for this book ( I read it for free through Kindle Unlimited) then you're in desperate need of a real book on car buying, because this book isn't worth a penny and I can only imagine how much you'll overpay on a car.\n\n-Mason"

3	"What an incredible man.\nI'm sure it is not easy to  write about such a great man who's life spans more than eighty years.\nThe content is very interesting. It's worth overlooking the writing style."
1	'So boring!  I enjoyed the first, the second was intriguing, the third was a bit heavy...but this one, I abandoned it, I jumped to the end.  Descriptions were long... War and peace alike, but not good.  In the middle of the action many "longueurs".  I didn\'t like it!\n\nI am sorry.  I lost too much time.'
2	'I accidentally bought this book, intending to by a book of the same name by another author.  It is more geared to a much younger audience (I am a senior citizen) and I did not find it relevant or enjoyable to read.  It is very short, and it may have some value for a younger audience, but it was not a book for me.'
2	'Well book one was a freebie and not too bad so I purchased book two.  My mistake I assure you.  These are not the same people in BOOK 1that shows up in BOOK two. TotAlly unbelievable, chaotic, choppy, and once again the rip off. BOOK three is apparently no better so I guess I will come up with my own HEA.'
2	"The answer is too simple and can only get you 6 point at best. In part 2 the answer can't even last one minute talking. Such a waste of money !"
1	'I was bored by the halfway point, but wanted to give this book a chance. I gave it many chances, but the ending was no more satisfying than any other part. Howzell can write poetically, but the plot dragged and the character interactions became repetitive.'
3	"I like the book but bad ending it grabs your attention at the beginning and come with a twist in the middle. Overall it's a nice book"
1	"I downloaded the book. But only got the cover and the 1st page. It must not of been formatted properly. I'm going to try again right now...I just did and it did not download all the way. 101 Mothers day gift basket ideas is a stretch anyway. I guess that is why it is free."

3	"It was OK.  Most of it was common sense so I really didn't learn anything new."
3	'I enjoyed the first two chapters of this book and found it promising. I liked Nick, the hero. Though he was made to offer marriage to Gabby due to a wager, at least he was honest and told her about it right off instead of beating around the bush and seducing her first. Gabby is very likeable as well. The birthmark on her  face may have been some kind of repellent, but she seemed genuinely intelligent and self-sufficient. The fact that Nick and Gabby used to be very good friends as children made it easy to believe that they could get along and that Nick could actually fall for her.\n\nI was a bit confused about how the author wanted to portray the heroine\'s brother and his relationship with his wife Edna. First she writes about the brother preferring the pleasures of his mistresses in town while his wife Edna is left at his estate. Then in Chapter 5 it says: "...her brother was a weak man and a woman like Edna had him wrapped around her little finger." That does not fit at all. If that was the case, then the brother would not be losing his fortune by gambling nor would he openly keep mistresses around.\n\nI also couldn\'t like the sexual content. It\'s not that it is overly vulgar, but i just found the author dealt more about it than other plots of the book which could have made this more interesting. I understand that the heroine is a virgin, but for the author to write all those silly questions (and answers) is rather off the road. It felt like reading something like Sex for Dummies. I find it made this novella unnecessarily longer without contributing any weight to the development of the story. The conflict between the hero, the heroine, her brother and sister-in-law was, on the other hand, very quickly resolved after only one confrontation and all became well. It would have been so much better had the author worked harder on that particular part of the story.\n\nThe author employed an editor, Em Petrova, but i find that this editor does not deliver a splendid job. There are still errors in this book that simple proofreading should be able to correct. Aside from a few spelling errors, my kindle copy contains two chapter 11. Of course, the last must be chapter 12 but i find an omission like that reflects poorly. I have read another book edited by this editor as well, Sinful Cravings by Samantha Holt, and the editing there was even worse. Overall a quick read that won\'t tax one\'s imagination.'
3	'The first half of the book is extremely boring.......but the second half is great!  So my advice is to speed read the first half!!'
2	'I loved the first few books of the Sword of Truth series. It was a bit raw, but it was action packed and the conflicts were intriguing. But, as the series moved on, Goodkind spent more and more time preaching about Randian philosophy. Although I am mostly sympathetic to that philosophy, it\'s not the reason I read the books. Yes, the underlying theme of personal responsibility and free will do help the stories and the character motivations, but that is no reason to drone on for page after page on the subject. When the characters sit around and play the "As you know, Jim" game as they reexplain their philosophy to each other, it gets very boring.\n\nThe story itself is slow to develop (mostly bogged down by the preaching), yet still missing essential conflicts. The subjects who are intent on knowing about prophesy are paper thin and unbelievable. Richard and Khalan\'s handling of those people is inept at best and causes problems with their own free will philosophy.  The ultimate bad guy doesn\'t show up until well into the book, and then disappears again for the most part while another henchman becomes the main focus.\n\nOverall, the story was sloppy, not well plotted, not well paced, and not well edited. And, it is very obvious that this was really the first half (one third?) of a story that was fleshed out (most, again, with boring preaching) to be a full length book. The ending was not satisfying at all.\n\nThis was very disappointing. I had hoped that Goodkind would have tried to go back to his roots and be the storyteller that he was in the past. Instead, he magnified all the bad things about the Sword of Truth series in this book, and did not work very hard at strengthening his good writing qualities. I doubt I\'ll buy the next book.'
2	"To much domination and sex.  Better if implied instead of graphic descriptions.  Haven't read the rest of them yet but the first one turned me of the series"
3	'This book was very engrossing and kept my interest.  It\'s reminiscent of books like "The Da Vinci Code".  Lots of plot twists and surprise revelations.  I\'m a big reader and love the sci fi genre and while this book was enjoyable there were things I wasn\'t a fan of... the characters can be confusing at times, some of the revelations were a little contrived and the reading level is pretty easy.  For a debut novel this author did a great job.  I\'m going to read the sequel and I would recommend this book it just isn\'t up in my favorites.  Overall a fun, interesting read.'
1	'It is messy and badly written. I personally found it hard to follow but maybe in the "author\'s" mind it all seems like a proper book. It is bad and  anti  women. he says "giving women power" was basically where everything began do go to hell ! Just another wannabe writer. I guess just anybody can post their "book" on Amazon now.'
3	"The first part of this book discusses the early theories of how the larger pyramids were built and some current theories.  I found the idea of each block being cast, rather than quarried, to be interesting and quite plausible.  The second part of this book takes a Biblical interpretation to the constellations, Egypts fall, its religion, and its relation to prophecy.  The author opines that the star Polaris means Satan in Greek, yet Im not so sure.  My knowledge of Latin and further research didn't reveal that.  In fact, Polaris is a compound word taken from polar and star, to create a New Latin word, Polaris.  There are so many quotes and interpretations from the Bible, some quotes which I am not familiar with (perhaps the author used a different Bible than I?), that I might later crosscheck them.  Overall, I liked the first section of this book for its thought-provoking postulations, but the second half seemed weak to me."
2	'Maggie Kean finds the body of her elderly neighbor, Elizabeth Boyer, blocking her septic tank at the beginning of this poorly-plotted book. Hunky detective Sam Villari shows up to investigate. He seems pretty incompetent and Maggie decides to look for the killer herself, which she proceeds to do in a completely haphazard and silly way. The two grandchildren of the deceased butt in as possible suspects. Maggie and Villari exchange some kisses, even though she thinks he suspects her as the killer -- and despite the fact that he smokes. The smooches with Mr Ashtray Mouth are pleasant for both parties and he invites her to meet his stereotypical Italian-American family. Mamma makes spaghetti and likes Maggie. Maggie likes spaghetti. Some more investigating happens and vague clues emerge. Threats are issued. More smooches. A climax of sorts happens. Someone or other is exposed as the killer and some kind of motive is offered. And then this entirely predictable and utterly absurd book ends and the scene is set for the next in the series. Hopefully the author will prosper and write another 60 books about the irrepressible Maggie. Her fans will rush to buy them for 99 cents apiece. Everyone will be happy. But for me, the series ends here with book one. Enjoy!'
3	"This book was simple and fast to read. I didn't find much plot. I wish it had developed into more, the ending was just that.....an ending. For me, this was just a simple story."
2	"You get what you pay for. This set was on special for $2.99, so I guess I did get my money's worth. However, if you are looking to purchase any of these stories separately or this set, be forewarned. The imagery is almost nonexistent, the character development is minimal, and the storylines are predictable and are repeated in multiple stories. Example: Amish person finds true love, spouse dies, the person misses the deceased terribly, person finds new spouse. Additionally, if you are looking for a true Amish historical fiction novel, you will not find it here. Simply replacing the word God with Gott does not place it in this category. If you want true Amish historical fiction, run, not walk, back to Beverly Lewis or even Wanda Brunstetter. That's what I am doing."
1	"Sure, I cook and bake often. But, I don't have much use for a cookbook that does not even suggest which size of baking pan to use. Surely, I could figure that out, but any cookbook should at least give you a suggested size - you can then choose to use that exact sized pan or choose another kind that will accommodate the same volume."
3	"Another cliffhanger, but still a pretty good book. Alyssa can't make up her mind which man she wants a relationship with. She starts getting so tired of being pulled back and forth, even though that doesn't stop her from bed hopping between them. It was a good paranormal story and fun to see what was going to happen next."
2	"Talk about wham ,bam ,thank you mam. Our started out good but was over to quickly. When it just started getting good......done!!!!! If it can draw you in that quickly there should've been more to read."
1	"A poor effort at journalism, badly written, the author (hard to call him that) clearly has an agenda. It is clear to me that that this article was released as a a kindle single because no magazine would publish it and/or pay to do so. It reads like a teenager's first effort at copying Hunter S Thompson.\n\nDo not waste your money on this!"
3	'but it was too short! has a lot of potential I think. I really loved how Dale desired her the whole time.'
1	"What a waste of money!! This didn't even make sense to me. Not only did it not follow the original movie, the plot was ridiculous."
3	'to much details'
3	"The book is interesting, but I have pretty much all the Lance Armstrong books, great stuff then later when the truth came out, bad, very bad stuff. Most of what is said in this book exists elsewhere in bits and pieces. If you don't have any other Lance post doping scandal books, then this pretty much covers it. Sadly I think Lance was only the biggest fish caught. It's how he destroyed his detractors that ultimately led to his downfall."
3	"Stephen Blake is an actor whose Mom is a well known actress and his dad a lawyer.  He decides to become an actor and has a younger boyfriend that none of his friends like.  Stephen's career has stalled and he has just hit 30.  He is bored by Blake and is cheating while Blake is starting to look for greener pastures as well.\n\nIt is hard to like either Stephen or Blake.  They are both self-centered and manipulative in their own way.  Blake has long left his young, sweet ways and has become a nag while letting Stephen pay most of the bills and do most of the house work.  Rick, an older well hung man, moves in next door and Blake starts seeing him and moves in with him while Stephen is filming a commercial.  Stephen decides to come home early and finds he has been dumped and manages to keep Blake from emptying the house.\n\nThe good things about the book deal with Stephen coming to terms with being 30 and being dumped.  Thirty is a hard birthday for everyone.  It is that milestone birthday where you are no longer young and it is the yardstick birthday where you measure what you have accomplished against everyone else.  Getting dumped for another older, better-hung man is a hard thing for Stephen to deal with on top of aging.  At first he becomes obsessive about getting Blake back, but he grows a spine and becomes a hero for anyone male or female who has been dumped.  Yeah on moving on Stephen."
3	"I did enjoy this book but I didn't enjoy it as much as the others. There are a lot of missing words throughout the book also"
3	'I would like to give my review a 2.5 stars since it wasn\'t bad enough for a 2 and not good enough for a 3 in my opinion. The overall storyline was OK and the characters were interesting. The opening chapter was confusing because it seemed like the main soldier characters were insects because of the references to their shells, eyestalks and how at one point they stood in front of huge \'shrooms". That didn\'t clear up until later.\n\nThe biggest and most annoying problems I had reading this book were all the typos, calling the characters by different names, using incorrect pronouns (he instead of she, etc.), not capitalizing characters\' names, using the wrong words ("Evon, luck for him, was up ...."). It took much longer to read this book than it should have.\n\nI would like to reread this book if someone proof-read it and cleaned up the problems.'
2	"Sadly I am giving this book two stars. Usually all of the books I read turn out to be good. It's not that it wasn't good it's just I want more of something that isn't there. The story was predictable to me. I mean she meets a guy who she is suppose to be scared of who turns out not to be that bad. And he's suppose to be scared of her but actually starts to like her. Then they have a child it was just to predictable like she wanted me to know the whole story. I just expected to feel something it was like everything was moving so fast that in the book or seemed like she had just like and married the guy because he was cute. My advise to Carey Corp is next time you might want to put a little more detail in your next book. Now I have been a little harsh so I bet you think I didn't like the book. But the truth is I kinda liked it to. Yeah I bet it's funny huh. But at the same time during the book I recognized the theme of the book. Well I don't know if I got  it right bit to me it came out as two different worlds with different views , with two different people . They learn that they aren't as scary to each other as they are said to  be and eventually  they learn to love each other and live happily ever after. to So I guess the book was alright but I guess I expected more  and just never got it I was disappointed I really expected more out of her work. I still think you should give this book a chance just because I didn't like doesn't mean another reader might not like it . So go on ahead and try it you never know you might want more of what you can't get or your thirst might be quenched."
3	'I have to admit Collin is a favourite of mine despite being the ultimate demon and bad boy, he loves Ivy and is desperately trying to save her from himself, the world at large and Kreterus the demon king. This book takes places just after giving up her sister Apryl by mistake thinking she was the prophesy one when in actuality it was Ivy all along. Trying to protect her, he keeps on hurting her as she has feelings for him but he pushes her away to keep her safe. This novella while short gives you an insight into Collin and how he felt about Ivy even in the beginning, something so pure and innocent yet she drives him crazy as he struggles to keep her safe. She is her own worst enemy and we love the bad boy in spite of all he represents because we hope that he is worth saving and Collin just might be. He truly loves her and will do anything even sacrifice himself to save her but will it be enough.'
2	'Very simple. Simple to the point that it does not cover the topics sufficiently.  Incomplete training instructions.  Background information on the breed is no better than Wikipedia.'
3	'A typical zombie story where a hopeless geek loser turns out to be the best survivor and eventually gets the girl.'
1	"Don't buy this book. It is absolutely not needed. It is poorly written with grammatically incorrect sentences. It claims to be broken up into five parts, but only lists three. This book has almost no valuable information regarding the Enterprise Management Training Program, and certainly no details that couldn't be found elsewhere. This book is 9 pages long and costs nearly 10 dollars. I just finished the first Enterprise interview, and NONE of the four possible interview questions mentioned in this book were asked. I don't think this book is worth the money."
1	"Well, the author writes that there is passion galore amongst the characters.  Well, if she says so, it certainly does not come through in the writing.  The supposed heroine dilly-dallys, is it this guy, that guy. Can't imagine why either guy cares. I would hate to be behind her in the buffet line."
1	"The book didn't grab my attention immediately, if ever.  Took a long time to read since I wasn't that interested in it.  Hard to keep track of all the characters.  I also didn't really like any of the characters."
2	'There were a lot of typos and grammar mistakes. It detracted from the story.'

2	"Fans of Catherine Coulter's the Bride series will enjoy the return of the Sherbrooke family. This was my first book by this author. So, I didn't discover this tidbit of information until after I read this book. I really don't like to read a book that's built on characters of previous books I haven't read, but didn't feel I was missing anything with WIZARD'S DAUGHTER.\n\nRosalind de la Fontaine isn't her real name. She doesn't know it nor does she remember her past. Ryder Sherbrooke finds her when she is around eight. No one is certain that was her age. She was severely beaten and it was a miracle she lived. Ryder and Sophia Sherbrooke took her in and raise her as a relative.\n\nHer first season in London, she meets and marries Nicholas Vail. What neither of them are aware of is both have within them very powerful magic. You see, both are descendants of wizards. The answer to their past unfolds like a mystery. Both have an important mission to carry out.\n\nSo much is wrong with this book, yet I stayed with it until the end. Even though the dialogue was off and the author didn't convince me the time period was 1835 London, I loved the characters and the mystery behind them. It was a painful page-turner, because some of those passages were painful to read. Yet, I couldn't stop if I wanted to.\n\nWill I pick up another book by this author? Sure! I'd like to read her FBI series before deciding on whether or not to continue on."
3	'I love the cover on this book! Marcia always has such original covers! I like that they aren\'t stock... (I hate seeing the same book covers on different authors\' books.)\nI just found that Marcia\'s books suddenly became available on Kindle Unlimited so I "borrowed" them all. I could never afford to buy them all at the full price so this allows me to read them for free and return them, which I am grateful for.\nI prefer her historic romances to these more modern tales. I\'m glad I didn\'t have to pay for this one. She has some excellent books. Unfortunately, this isn\'t one of them. It lacks maturity and depth of characters. It was okay but not my favourite by far. I loved The Crimson Knight and some of her other historical fiction books. My favourite of her more modern books was A kiss In the Dark. I\'m glad to have had the chance to read this for free and I\'m looking forward to reading the rest of her books.'
3	"E-readers, it seems to me, now fulfill  the function of those anthology magazines known as pulp fiction. A space where a writer can gain experience, sharpen their skill, hone their craft and the masters can come out to play...to share the stories, that have a voice...but not a whole tale to tell\n\nMercedes Lackey is a skilled crafter of tales who shares in thisvenue, stories that have something to say...because l'm not sure what, l'm quite unbalanced by the foolish grin that l have worn since reading this tale...thanks"
3	"It took me a while to figure out why I ended this book dissatisfied, but I did eventually realize it. There just wasn't enough. And I checked, thinking maybe it was shorter than the other books, but it was in the middle length-wise. I thought over it some more, and realized the problem was with the story.\n\nI enjoyed Shea's writing as always, and I do like where the story is headed, but...meh. Britt pretending to be a boy is the big secret of the story, something that ought to be one of the biggest climaxes of the whole story line. This is what, 7th century England? We've already seen that there are issues with men respecting women and women having rights (both of which should be there, for accuracy's sake). Given the fact that these knights have been following a woman, they handle it really well. Getting drunk and yelling in their hall (and not even at Britt) is like a toddler's temper tantrum to what it should have been. The whole drama is wrapped up within a week or so, and Britt essentially wins them all back over with a heartfelt speech.\n\nSo much more could have been done with it. I'm all right with the fact that the reveal doesn't happen in the last book, because I am looking forward to seeing how the knights react to Britt, not Arthur. But it isn't just that more could have happened, more should have happened. Britt should have been separated from them for a longer period of time. I actually would have liked to see her go to London, and perhaps even adopt living like a woman as she hides from her knights. I like that they were upset, but they needed to be angrier. It should've taken more for them to get over it. At the very least an outside crisis that forces them to realize that what Britt has underneath her clothes doesn't affect her ability to lead them. These men ought to have had their entire lifetimes to develop feelings of superiority over women (because it's ~7th century England) and it should take way more than a pretty speech for them to knock down the first of those prejudices. Ideally, I think the whole plot could have been extended and split into two books, this one ending with Britt realizing that her knights have discovered her true gender.\n\nOn an entirely different note, I'm not one for love triangles, but dear God let Bedivere become a romantic interest. I love that boy and I think he'd be good for Britt. And Merlin definitely needs someone to shake up his comfort zone."
2	"The idea of the group home worker trying to protect one go the boys sounded wonderful but was handled oddly. The relationship between H/H/h was just bizarre. I didn't believe their motivations or the character interaction. I doubt there are many firemen who would go from questioning someone they caught in an arsonist's playground, with a gas can and matches, and just take her on the hood of her car. Plus the alpha maleness of H/H doesn't seem like loving leadership, more like bossy jerks. The development of the relationship just doesn't ring true.  Better luck next time."
3	'Liz Coleman is a successful lesbian woman living in the big city, occasionally hanging with her two lesbian girlfriends, when she decides to take a chance with a company called "Global Love Solutions" and request a mail-order-bride.\n\nWhat she gets is striking blonde beauty Svetlana Shevchenko, fresh from the Ukraine, who\'s not a lesbian, but wants to live in America - along with her mother.  Both the blonde beauty and her mother are impressed with Liz\'s apartment and her big-screen television, and Svetlana\'s mother is fully prepared to accept Liz as her "American daughter-in-law!"\n\nUnfortunately, Liz never really gets around to having sex with the long-legged beauty now living with her & sharing her bed, despite the fact that the girl is clearly willing to give it a try.  "Well, you brought me here to be your... your girlfriend.  So we will kiss."  Unfortunately Liz isn\'t the sort of woman to take full advantage of such a potentially pleasurable situation, and so instead most of this book involves her commiserating with her lesbian friends, Ann & Elle, about how\'s she ever going to get out of this situation.\n\nA fun read, but I kept hoping that she\'d purchase some sexy, skimpy lingerie for Svetlana to wear and then take her beautiful new wife somewhere upstate for a highly erotic honeymoon celebration, which sadly never happens!'
1	"This book is appalling. Readers ought to be warned before they pick up a freebie and find their skin crawling like mine did. I'll admit I did not get very far into the e-book and I skimmed a bit to make sure there wasn't some turn-a-round. Not as far as I could see.\n\nYou should be warned away from this e-book if:\n1. You find sufficiently graphic and frequent instances of child molestation offensive.\n2. You find a story told from the point of view of a child molester offensive.\n3. You find the sexual exploits (including incest and child molestation) of a young teen-age boy offensive.\n\nI deleted it from my account and my Kindle."

3	'Certainly not among my top David Baldacci works, but it was fanciful all the same. Almost worth the one dollar, but not among the top one dollar works out there, like The Sweetest Madness,which I read again and again.'
1	'Unfortunately, The Sheik\'s Furious Prisoner was just not for me. I didn\'t like the main characters and the situation that brought them together really didn\'t seem plausible to me. The majority of the book they spent arguing, not in a cute way -- it was more of an "I will stab you in the eye with a fork" way.\n\nAnd then BAM! Cherry Poppin\' Sexy Times. (I should mention, the author also messed up and called Saja (the main character), Macee during these sexy times.\n\nI think the character interaction is what killed this for me. I really saw no major shift in Prince Al-Qadir\'s attitude towards women. Pretty sure, he was still wanting to "tame" Saja and there really was no emotion coming from him or her for that matter. He was being led around by a feeling in his groin, and I\'m not even sure what she was being led by.\n\nI wish I could say that somehow the story redeemed itself at the end, but it didn\'t. Maybe it\'s the trope. Maybe Sheiks just aren\'t my thing.'
3	'Otherwise a good read wish it moved a little faster bought the next in the series hope this next box gets to the end of the dangers and that the people pull together not further apart like in all other end of our world books Love reading!!!!!'
2	'Good story line, for the few chapters you get in each "Part".  That said... I\'ve read samples longer than any of these "parts".  I doubt I\'ll continue the series if she does decide to publish unless the whole thing is included.  Editing was abyssmal.  Even a basic spell check would have caught many of the errors in part 2 and 3.'
3	'The plot to this was quite unique. It shows how small the world can really be. The climax of the book came towards the end, so up until then things slowly escalated and after things felt rushed. Also, too many religious references for my liking, but I can deal with that.'
3	'She speaks about eliminating certain foods that causes inflammation in our skin. It was insightful. I do believe this book could be beneficial to people who are not aware of the effects of food on the body'
3	'Had potential, but quickly fell a bit flat. (BTW: I read "What Remains" which was excellent.) From the reviews, I expected a tongue in cheek account of widowhood from a put-upon wife of a dirt bag. It was funny that she was expected to be in this sad state, but in truth, she was married to a cheating, narcissistic waste of space. She has to toe the line of being the dutiful widow to wanting to move on. Her dating foibles could have been made more humorous rather than the tedious series it became, and her best friend was barely tolerable. I really wanted to like both narrator and the BFF. The romance at the end was quickly put together. As I read, I thought it would end with her realizing she didn\'t need to be in a romantic relationship to get along in life with a potential for a sequel where she does find true love. I dunno if the publisher demanded that she find \'love,\' but this was rushed with no development. Heck, I would have preferred her to wind up with Carter the funeral director. She seemed to have more connection and history with him than the guy she did wind up with. The actor she dates is a self-important airhead (perhaps she was trying to display Hollywood\'s shallowness?). At certain points, I was also ready to send this woman to AA. She blacks out and sleeps with some pot head actor? She\'s too wimpy to dump her useless therapist after she finds a better one? Ok, I\'ll give her a pass for going to the fortune tellers because she\'s grasping at straws trying to find out what the frack is going on. The griot seemed totally unnecessary. He didn\'t add to the story.\n\nI could have done with out some of the unnecessary F-bombs. Do they really make the narrator seem more intelligent or deep? No. As I said, all the potential was there, but there was no follow through. I\'ll probably give CR\'s next novel a chance, but not without reading many reviews first. This woman has all the tools (seriously, read "What Remains"), but she didn\'t find her fiction footing here. It was a struggle to finish it.'
2	"I didn't learned nothing new"
3	'Good mystery but I felt it was too easy for the characters to find the clues. After the first encounter they should have expected the villain to show up at the next sites. They should have been prepared.'
2	"Good story line, mostly enjoyable characters... but there were so many grammatical errors that I almost didn't finish the book.  In fact, I only read to the end because I wanted to see how everything turned out.  The constant switching between present and past tense nearly drove me crazy.  And those, among other errors such as punctuation and word usage and mis-spellings, had me re-reading parts because of the confusion they caused.  They took away from the story to the point that I started speed-reading about half-way through so that I would miss most of them, but still get to finish the story.\nA decent proof reader could have done wonders for this book.  And I would have given a higher rating, for sure."
3	'This book is full of characters with drama and issues in their lives. The story was good and the characters were better.  Yes you may find some emotional triggers because this book is not all HEA, but it is HEA after the struggle passed the issues.  Some of the baggage is hard to think about, becomes people are horrid and evil sometimes,, but Emma pushed her way out of the dark place and back into the life she hoped to live.'
2	"Didn't enjoy this at all, the story was very bizarre and the writing very repetitive.  I was getting annoyed reading it but I did keep reading to the end. It definitely would not encourage me to read more from this writer."
3	'2.5 - "I don\'t want any of that nonsense." Stars.\n\nI am a big fan of Lauren Layne, and I am also a huge fan of the Stiletto & Oxford series\'. What I am not a huge fan of is overblown familial drama, especially when the villain of the piece then pretty much walks away without getting their just desserts.\n\nMollie was likeable but a little unremarkable, I liked her interactions with Jackson and the Oxford guys, but I found her constant excuses for her sisters lies and abhorrent behavior really difficult to stomach the more the story progressed.\n\nJackson, I\'m really on the fence with if I\'m being honest, all the other guys that we have met through the two series have all had a little something special about them and I just didn\'t get that feeling with him.\n\nI think the main problem I have is that the one thing that stood out from this story wasn\'t the relationship building between Jackson and Mollie and the issues they were working through due to their past association as brother and sister in law, because it was overtaken by the words and behavior of Madison, the sister/ex wife.\n\nTake out that whole side of the story though and the rest of it was to the authors usual high standards, I just really struggle with this trope, especially as I feel it didn\'t really need to be as bigger part of the story as it was, considering how it all pans out at the end. Onwards to Lincoln\'s book, the guy is carrying around a whole trunk of secrets, and I cannot wait to see what story Lauren gives him.\n\nARC generously provided via Netgalley, in exchange for the above honest review.'
3	"It's actually not a bad read. Though it's short and not very explanatory in some parts, it's one of those books that leave you wanting just a little bit more each time you put it down."
3	'Ok book. Too much explict sex and language for me. After reading various other books by this author I was expecting more suspense.'
3	"The information for newborns in this book was not very extensive.  I found 'happiest baby on the block' much more useful in that respect but there was some helpful tips for diagnosing sleep problems"
3	"King Arthur conquers all of Britain including Guinevere's family castle, and requires Guinevere to marry him. When Lancelot comes on the scene and becomes her champion, they fall in love and carry on a long-term sexual affair that is eventually discovered and reported by King Arthur's knights. King Arthur reluctantly sends Guinevere to be burned at the stake to save his reputation, but she is saved just in time by Lancelot and is eventually returned to King Arthur to save the rest of the country from war.\n\nThe plot is good, but the story is drawn out way too long by detailed description of numerous sexual encounters.  I found these boring and started skipping over them. I nearly stopped reading the book several times."
2	'I fund this book extremely disturbing. I felt the author wanted to impose her religious beliefs on the reader. The message I got out of the book was, free thinking women with liberal views were damned. Their only salvation is to give up their liberal view points and get to church!!! I felt the author sprinkled a little sex and intrigue in order to keep the reader mildly interested; while preaching very loudly... It was so wonderful, that the liberal free thinking woman, was able to give up all her life long beliefs, and return to the church in a few short days.... No wonder the main character had issues... her character is weak...'
2	'good,but too short. more courtship could and should have been added, all in all not a bad read at all.'
3	'not the best or the imitations.'
2	"The writing isn't that great and there are many gaps in the story line. It has a great concept, just wish it was better written"
3	'These books were well written.  It is good to get three books together, especially when you enjoy them.  The author is good and I would enjoy further books written by her.'
2	"I bought this book along with 2 others to prepare for the oral board.  This book could have gone into more detail.  In reality this book could have been 3 pages long because I feel the 7 sins are mainly common sense but a few you wouldn't think to have realized unless you read this book.  I wouldn't buy this book alone to get ready for oral boards but would use it as a supplement to other material as well."
1	'Reading the sample, and so relieved I did not read the whole thing..This needs a really good rewrite and edit. And a couple of proof readers thrown in. Sadley!'
1	"This book picks up where Unbreak Me ends with a rekindling romance between William Bailey and his long lost girlfriend, Callie. Unfortunately, no matter how virile, handsome and affluent Ryan tries to paint Willy, he is about as alpha male as Kermit the Frog. He was a sympathetic character in Unbreak Me but when his affection wavers from his bride Krystal to her sister Maggie, who was described as the love of his life to yet another love of his life, Callie, it leaves me wondering if there is yet another love of his life out there somewhere. And women are often accused of being flippant. Pfft.  His affection flitters between women like a kid with ADHD off his meds.\nCallie might actually be a believable character, if you separate her from gramma's boy William. Someone with Callie's past-a drug addicted parent, neglected during childhood, and forced into prostitution, wouldn't fall for William. And what is this obsession with his grandma? There is very little dialogue between the two yet, we're supposed to believe that a grown-ass, well-educated man won't leave his hick home town because he just can't leave grandma?\nI take back my star. Should change this series name to No Hope."
3	"Just don't like how it ended. There should've been a little more sex with all the teasing and instant attraction going on from the moment they met."
1	"Martin Hanna (Editor) and Cindy Tutsch are totally in support of women's ordination in the Seventh-day Adventist Church. This book to lays out their arguments in favor of women's ordination. In July, 2015, the World Church voted against women's ordination. Martin Hanna, refusing to support majority rule in the World Church, now requests that his ordination credential be dissolved. Women's Ordination, Questions & Answers, was written in an effort to sway the July 2015 World Church vote, but failed to do so. This book is skewed towards the authors' opinions, and old news. For a balanced book, I would suggest Women's Ordination, Does It Matter, by Wahlen."

Sorry girls, anything to do with laziness??  I to raised a child and worked for most of her childhood and now at 55 am basically raising two boys. I think more than a schedule or a huge guideline........just "do it".  Take pride in yourself and your sourroundings. Again, I\'m sure this will not go over at all........if you have time to write a book - getting dressed should be a breeze!'
3	"Some of her earlier books are much better.  For example: The Champions of Terra/Terran times was a fun series. I'm wondering if she's being pressured to mass produce?"
2	"You can download this for free from the FAA web site, among others. I got this one because it seemed to have graphics, and indeed it does. Unfortunately, those graphics are low resolution scans, it seems, so they don't scale up enough to be readable.\n\nGo to the FAA and get it directly."
3	'The stories are fast past and are enjoyable if you are looking for a change.'
2	'This was a quick, wham bam. Not only were the stories short but descriptions and details were lacking. Not worth the $.99.'
2	"Just wasn't for me."
2	'this book way too long, should finish right in the middle'
1	"I read some reviews before I downloaded this book.  One of them said it was a clean read.  I disagree.  Getting drunk and waking up naked with your least favorite person isn't my idea of clean."
1	"I read reviews, thought this would at least be a steamy read.  I found it terrible and struggled to even finish.  There is absolutely no connection to the characters.  No development of the characters.  No understanding of any of their motivation.  I'm really disappointed.  Thankful I didn't purchase the whole series.  I'm all for suspending some reality when I read, but this was just kinda ridiculous and immature."
3	'A few good tips and remarks.'
3	'Why oh why must the woman character be so broke or have no post high school education be the billionaire choice. I know this is fantasy. However this type of story line is getting old.'
2	'A little hard to swallow, the premise being that a celebrity chef goes back to her hometown, still in love with her HS boyfriend, to find that, after some preliminary nonsense, he still loves her. This is after 17 or 18 years. Too much to swallow. Sorry'
3	"There wasn't enough substance to this story and it ended in an awkward place.  Maybe if I'd had more of the series to compare it to, I would have felt differently.  The main character didn't really inspire me to root for her, although some of the darker characters had my support."
1	'Early biblical worship consisted in piling stones to form an altar, later the Tabernacle and Solomon\'s Temple. Steeple\'s and towers began in Constantine\'s times where State and Religion inter mixed and pagan were "seduced" into accepting the State Religion by adopting pagan objects of reverence. Just because something is mentioned in the bible, doesn\'t make it biblical as when the children of Israel sinned in adopting pagan ways. (Read 2 Kings 17).'
3	"Note: I received this digital version for free in order to review it. This is my honest opinion.\n\nI cook a lot of Mediterranean food and although there are some nice recipes in side, this is not a classic Mediterranean cook book or a good depiction of what the diet would or should look like in my opinion. Arepas? That's Colombian. A turkey wrap is not a Mediterranean dinner. And pancakes are pretty staple for breakfast. There is way too much 'advice'. Large people, don't wear lose clothing?? Hey, how about try not to eat a lot. That's great advice. With that all said, the actual recipes are a good start for anyone trying to cut back and cook a simple meal."
2	'Easy read'
1	"I couldn't read all of it and it was only 6 pages long.  It was written so poorly and didn't really make sense.  I skimmed through most of it."
3	"Much more metaphysical and less explanatory and harder to grasp...but perhaps that is because I am a musician and not a botanist.  Very richly in the vein of some of the most classic of sci fi--well thought out, but somehow, more elusive to me than the previous novel.  Which is odd, because I love Tyra's family more than anybody else and love the richness of FINALLY some POC in sci fi.  Well worth it, and I think my Luke-warm feelings towards some of the plot points are merely my own personal bias."
3	'Not really:('
1	"To my way of thinking, fat jokes are just as bad as racist jokes or jokes about the handicapped. Mostly just not funny. My rating would be zero stars, but you have to pick at least one. I don't care how fat the author is, the jokes are just not funny."
3	'nice little book but very sort. Would recommend pursuing a group of short stories.'
3	'I read this book because the first few books by A.M. Arthur I really enjoyed and so I had great hope for this one.  This book was only OK,  I\'d recommend it if you love hurt comfort and don\'t get hung up on the details.  But I am becoming less & less enamored with this authors style of how every character has so many problems that we are drowning in them.  The whole book is just rehashing the characters insecurities over & over again.  I did finish the book  but never really understood why these two are so in love or why it was so special over other relationships the two of them had.  I was confused by about several of the auxiliary characters (Nate & James)  in the book since I didn\'t read the first in this series (for a number of reasons).  I wouldn\'t really recommend reading this one without having read the first because of this.  At least I knew about James (Tag) but never warmed to him.  The plot seemed to a recycled from several of her earlier books & another series by a favorite m/m author.  Honestly I got a bit confused here wondering why certain characters weren\'t mentioned and then realizing that I\'d gotten the two series confused in my mind.  Last this  author needs to learn a bit more about the law regarding house ownership,  inheritance, police procedures and other such details.  And the cost of last minute plane tickets.  I know it\'s a major plot point, but  Her books are riddled with this type of problem and they irk me to no end.  Feels like it comes from someone young enough to have never dealt with such issues herself.\n\nP.S. This book had at least one obvious typo "double parking the car".. Shouldn\'t that be "parallel parking the car"'
1	'The plot was predictable but could have been better with some grammar errors.  The writing style was amateurish at times.  It threw me off when the guy talks like a woman.  Example..."feeling faint".  This was weird for a guy to say.  It seems the author tried to make the guy be manly and hot but not much of an alpha for sure.  Just flipped through the pages after every page became redundant and predictable and boring.  This is a type of book that after reading it that you forgot about it.  If you don\'t mind the man as being wimpy and the writing with grammar errors don\'t bother you, this book is for you.  Otherwise, don\'t waste your time.'
2	'I stumbled on A Chance at Destiny via friends on Goodreads and, I decided to give it a chance based on the price point. I\'m always excited to read work by new indie authors, however, this story left me unfulfilled. Ms. London, the premise is phenomenal. It could be a potent five-star story, but it didn\'t work for me for two reasons: 1) The writing was elementary at times. In some instances, simple is great but the phrasing of sentences read along the lines of, "See spot run" dialogue. In my opinion, with the assistance of a great editor to help structure sentences and cut out a lot of unnecessary filler, this story could be amazing. 2) The excessive grammatical errors. It was clear to me that little to no proofreading happened before this book was published. Had there been additional sets of eyes, a lot of the egregious errors would\'ve likely been caught. Ms. London, I commend you for having the courage to write your story as you envisioned it. I think with some adjustments, you have a true gem on your hands. Tyler and Destiny were likable characters, but I was missing the overall cohesiveness that helps a story flow flawlessly. I wish you the best in your future writing endeavors.'
3	'*****SPIOLER ALERT***\n\nEditing was poor in this one as well.\n\nYes I\'m sure your wondering why I bought it. I had to see what would happen next.\n\nIt\'s a decent story but very rushed.\n\nThe "Doc" takes someone dear to Gwen. She still doesn\'t realize he is right under her nose.\n\nI feel the cliff hanger is poor. The writer is basically telling us this has been a matter of days between the two books. I just don\'t see her finding out she is pregnant just 3-4 days after sex. It\'s way to early.'
1	'Did not enjoy this book.  I found it very confusing at times.  The heroine had no idea of which man she loved and jumped from one to the next.  I do not like not finishing a book but had a hard time finishing it.  It was certainly nothing like Downton Abbey as was advertised. Deleted it from my kindle.'
3	"The first three books are great. The last book is a bit of a let down. I'd definitely rate the first three 4 starts but the last was a 2 in my opinion. The last book was just very rushed and left a few unanswered questions."
1	'The book boasts of different games with the exception of one , they are all the same old games.  Sadly disappointed:('
2	"I have suffered from stress and anxiety for quite some time. Almost everything in here is common sense and/or things I have already tried and failed. I gave it 2 stars because maybe something will work for someone who hasn't tried some of this stuff, but for me personally I was not impressed.\n\nI received this for free or a discounted price for my unbiased review."
2	"This was no where near as good as the first two! To be honest I didn't like it!  And it's sad because I loved the first one and really liked the second!"
1	'This should not have been a paid book - I have read sample books that were longer - it was misrepresented as longer.'
3	'Very informative, without being wacky. A good guide on what to do during an Ebola outbreak, and the chances of it happening in your area.'
2	'Downloaded this book to my kindle to read to my grandaughter and frankly it was boring.  I wound up making up addition to the story.'
3	'I was looking for a good read on improving leadership soft skills. This read has a few light chapters on soft skills but contains a great deal of detail on running a small business. Good resource for small business owner at the end. Not what I was looking for but not a bad read.'
2	"Read a short story by Justin Stanchfield and enjoyed it so I figured I'd try his novel.  I finished it, so I guess it wasn't awful, but it's also not terribly well written.  Kind of an interesting backdrop - an alien archeological dig on a distant planet, but the characters end up being one dimensional and bit hard to believe, and the dialog is peppered with cliches.  Feels like an early effort on his part."
1	"I always finish a book that I start, but I just couldn't do it. It was so unrealistic and the fact that the main character's best friend encouraged her to give the guy who physically tried to hurt and humiliate her a second chance was unbelievable! What real friend would do that?"
1	'Although a good broad overview is given there is nothing new here. Save your money and time, and instead go and re-read Lean Thinking.'
3	"After reading, and loving Elsborg's Power of Love I had to see what else she had out there. I found Lucy in the Sky and the blurb seemed right up my ally. Unfortunately, I was a bit let down. There wasn't enough background information about the alien culture that Lucy was introduced to, and Three's character seemed underdeveloped. The ramblings of Lucy were hilarious and the sex scenes were pretty darn hot, but I was expecting more. If you're looking for a book to make you giggle and get you hot without a whole lot of plot this is for you. I have days when I'm looking for books like this, but I guess yesterday just wasn't one of them.\n\nDisclaimer: There are M/M scenes."
2	'Charming tale with no depth or substance. Reminded me of the old Rod Sterling (sic?) TV series The Twilight Zone.'
3	"Love's Greatest Gift is a novella about a woman named Meghan, desperately trying to find a bone marrow match for her 15-year-old daughter. When she goes back to her hometown to ask for help from her family, she ends up meeting her estranged husband who she hasn't seen in eight years.\n\nIt's a quick and easy read, and the story flowed nicely. It gave a pretty good glimpse of the characters, and I found myself rooting for Liam. He's an admirable person and just the type of man any woman would want to be with. Meghan, I admit, annoyed me a bit. I couldn't believe she would believe someone else over the man she has loved for years and years. She could have at least confronted Liam, but she chose to run away with their daughter. In the end, she did redeem herself in my eyes though.\n\nIf you're in the mood for a short story about love and forgiveness set during the Christmas season, check out Love's Greatest Gift."
3	"Under a Graveyard Sky was my introduction to the author, John Ringo.  It is not great literature, but it is an entertaining action-adventure novel.  The hero is an improbable (to me) 13-year old with the skills of a well trained, heavily experienced Special Forces operative.  Ringo has a definite POV, and it's not progressive.  Nevertheless, the action and plot are fun, and the story is an interesting take on a deadly virus that seems to turn its victims into zombies.  As you would expect, there's a lot of violence and gore."
3	"The grammar wasn't perfect, but the premise was a good one. I enjoyed being inspired to replace old habits with the healthy new ones suggested. This book has changed me some.\nThank you to the author."
1	"Book on Kindle was difficult to use.  Answers weren't easily available.  You have to read through the 20 questions for a section before you come to the link for the answers.  I had hoped to use the book at a party, but would have wanted to see the answers for the question, right after the question. Scraped the idea of using the book, so it was a waste of my money."

1	'Huh?  I think i will have to read it again , I must have missed somthing..... All of a sudden ......The End.'
3	"Good informational book, but quite brief. I would have loved to see a timeline included, so as the many dates were referenced the reader could follow along from a good reference point. It would be a good supplement to a lesson, but I my opinion not clear and thorough enough for a lesson on just what is contained here.\nI received this product at a discount or free to try and provide an honest review - if it was helpful, please click 'yes' below!"
3	"Left me feeling just a little disappointed. It felt too rushed and needed a little more information. I wanted to like it much more than I did, don't get me wrong it was a great quick read, but it just felt rushed."
3	'A mother s LOVE for her son leads to deception and joy but also tears and trying times.  You will enjoy.'
1	'A poorly written article that was no more than an outline of VELMA Garfield life.  A middle school student could have written a more in depth story than the author did.  SEVERAL PAGES were trying to encourage the reader to purchase other books by this author.  This book is a total waste of valuable reading time.'
3	"all about pasta and the many kinds of pasta. what to coo with what and such as that. if you don't know much about pasta you will after this book"
1	'Horrible'
3	"To me this book was not as good as hers usually are. The characters were good but it was a bit slow for me and too many things that didn't ring true. Such as Reece hearing gunshots, finding Emily running from a killer and he just takes her back to her apt and goes to his office??? And she doesn't show him the pictures she took? Etc etc."
3	'First time reading something from this Author and ,I thought it was a good read. Only wished I could have known more about Cassie and Jack afterwards did they get married etc.'

1	'not the report'
3	"It's not bad but I just don't really like the characters enough to really get into the story."
1	"I give this 1 star since zero isn't an option.  Whoever scanned this to make a e-Book out of it needs to find a new job.  The text instead of top to bottom, reads left to right and splits pages in half after the first page."
3	"The Fifth Wheel (published 1915) picks up where Bobbie, General Manager ends, but with Ruth as the main character, instead of her sister Bobbie.  Ruth has been trained to be a mindless debutante, but decides to try a different path and find a job in New York City.\n\nWhile Ruth's story was mostly enjoyable, I found some of her adventures--and her happy ending--to be improbable.  In addition,  I was disconcerted by the details of events not matching between the two novels.  I also grew tired of the discussions about suffrage and woman's-place, feeling that Prouty used this novel more as a platform to air opinions than to tell a story.\n\nDespite my complaints, it was, as I said, mostly enjoyable; a quick, light read that gives an idea of what life was like during the American Gilded Age."
3	'The author clearly adores food, and it shows in her detailed and delectable-sounding descriptions. But her relationship with food veered through binging, emotional eating, and severe restriction. My favorite parts were related to the journey of healing her food addiction. However, this is only about 30% of the book. The rest is a coming-of-age story in a family with addictive behaviors. I would have been happy with less excruciating detail in that part of the book.'
3	'I was not overly fond of the voices used to portray the different characters, though they could have been much worse. Most irksome though was the slight changes in text. It is one thing in a dramatized version to leave off the "he said" portions of a line, but it is quite another when you leave off whole sentences and still call it "unabridged." Or when you change things like "he" to "she" when a pronoun is used to refer to an inanimate object. I followed along in the book for one chapter (Eeyore Loses His Tail), and though the changes were small and relatively infrequent, I was still disappointed.'
3	"I keep trying to like Ms. March's books more but they seem so over the top sweet that I can't relate to the characters.  I don't know if it's my environment or what, but the people I relate to aren't always so stinking perfect."
1	'As the old adage goes, never judge a book by its cover. However, to demonstrate how poorly edited this memoir is, the figure on the book cover is clearly facing due North, yet the sun is rising (or setting?) in that direction. Never mind the eponymous direction.\n\nJudging from the glowing reviews on the book, it is obvious that many of the author\'s friends "up-voted" their reviews.'

1	"Don't let my headline mislead you. Pig vomit was being kind. I read the samples and immediately the thought of cleaning up what my dogs leave in the yard.\nBut otherwise it is not so bad."
1	'Well written, graphic descriptions.  L'
3	"This book is a short story with casual prose. Given the storyline and informal style, it should have been written for perhaps the high school age group. I think the author should have left out the rape reference and bitch usage to keep it at the appropriate age-group since it's too simplistic for adult. The plot has an entertaining and fun feel and given how short it is, it's a nice little escape piece. It's a good idea for a larger, more complex plot."
3	'I enjoyed this series even though there are many faults with it.\nThe writing is average, the world is generic, so is the plot, and so are the majority of the characters both heroes and villains.\nSo why did I enjoy it? I think despite the faults of the author he knows how to pace his story and make it entertaining.\nIn some ways, I think this is more difficult to do, especially with generic materials he starts out with.\nSo kudos to you Mr. Ploof, and keep working at it. While there are many authors that are better at the craft than you at the moment, I think you have potential.\nP.S. I\'ve seen marked improvements in "The Windwalker Archive" series so clearly you\'re getting better.'
2	'I was very disappointed with this book. I felt like there was such possibly to delve into the character of Christian Grey, but E.L James really missed the mark, for me, on this one, instead showing Christian as one dimensional and slightly narcissistic with no character development whatsoever. Not to mention all the regurgitated material from the Fifty Shades, it was really just a huge disappointment.'
2	"This one is quite forgettable.\nAudrey seems rather dumb to me. Why go after a criminal in the middle of a snowstorm with no one knowing where you are, and you have no weapons for protection. Really?? You want to capture the criminal but you don't know what crimes he has committed, what kind of person he is.\n\nHe didn't trap her, she trapped herself."

1	'I loved the concept of two friends falling in love. But I couldn\'t get past the friendship. It wasn\'t realistic. To me, their friendship was saturated with physical affection characteristic of romantic relationships, not friendships. At least if a guy was staring into my eyes, brushing hair away from my face, with his arm lying across my chair, I wouldn\'t be thinking "this is a normal platonic friendship." I couldn\'t finish it because it was unrealistic.'

3	"Line of fire is a brother best friend love story. For me was a little bit hard reading because of the whey Jason and Molly communicated. In the beginning they didn't finish their thoughts or sentence. It was a lot of their reflections and thoughts and not a lot of happening.\nMolly and Jason have known each other for years. So long is also Mollys love for Jacob. And when Molly disappears for month only then Jason realizes how deep and strong his emotions are for Molly and is ready to fight for them. Molly was many time betrayed and hurt because of Jason. When new version of Jason tries for the first time to have relationship with her she because of fear serve him with his own medicine now relationship just sex and nobody has to know. But there is a lot of undiscussed things in the past that can ruin everything. Story also follows Jasons brother Marcus and his relationship.\nI wish that it wasn't so many repetitions of same thoughts. But story shows what is one of the most important things in relationship- communication.\n*ARC provided by Netgalley in exchange for an honest review"
1	"I must have been reading a different book from other reviewers because this was the most painful read I have ever had to force myself through. Yes, force myself.\n\nI knew within the first two chapters that I would rather walk away from this, but others praised the book so I pressed on. Ultimately, I reached a point where I wanted to write this review but knew I would have to finish the book if my review was to be legitimate. This has also been an eye opener regarding the content of the Kindle lending library and other reader's reviews. This is not F. Scott Fitzgerald.\n\nThe plot, such as it is, strains credulity, character development is thin, and the book's grammar is seriously lacking in spots. Most bothersome, the dialog was often out of place with the setting in the book. Colloquialisms typical in today's conversational dialog find their way into character's mouths when they are portrayed as non-native English speakers and set in another country in another time.\n\nThere are better ways to spend your time. Nonetheless, the author has found an audience for his work, so kudos for that. Unfortunately, it will no longer include me."

3	"Im ashamed to have to say this, but Ive finally found a Sherlock Holmes thats somewhat of a dud. At least, as duddish as any Sherlock Holmes can be. If you're a devoted fan that loves Holmes and his methods, its still probably worth your time. However, The Sign of the Four is far and away my least favorite Holmes book to date (and Ive read almost all of them).\n\nIt starts with poor Sherlock Holmes having nothing to do. Hes so bored that hes resorted to giving himself cocaine injections. Dr. Watson begs him to stop, but he replies that the only cure for it is a problem to solve. And what happens upon them next but a mystery? Miss Mary Morstan, pretty, young, and available, asks for assistance in the recovery of her disappeared father and discovering the source of the treasure that keeps appearing at her doorstep. Watson and Holmes are on the case, but Watson is even less help than usual, being more than a little distracted with Miss Morstan.\n\nSo what was wrong with it for me? After a while, I simply didn't care. The mystery lacked the compelling backstory of A Study in Scarlet and the wonderfully creepy suspense of The Hound of the Baskervilles. When we do get a backstory, its convoluted and yawn-inducing, and the suspense is mostly centered around whether the now-wealthy Miss Morstan will so much as look at Watson  which is to say theres little suspense at all. Miss Morstan herself is a sweet enough creation but with no more than the ordinary amount of gumption, and Watson makes himself silly over her. Sherlock does his best, but Im not really one for the missing-treasure storyline; murders are a good deal more interesting.\n\nBut like I said, if you're a fan, check this out. If nothing else, youll finally understand how and why Watson got the wife he mentions throughout the rest of the series, if not why she mysteriously disappears a few books afterwards. Not the best Holmes, but still Holmes."
3	'At first I was disappointed that this was just the table of contents but after looking through it, it does give an interesting outline of his works.\n\nI thought I was getting the complete works but it turns out that it was not the case. I suppose that is why it was free.'

3	"Remember when I reviewed Play Me (You know two weeks ago LOL) by Diane Alberts? I was on the fence because I wasn't thrilled with the heroine.. she rather drove me nuts? Well, Take Me is book four in that series and in my most humble opinion, Ms Alberts redeems herself. In Take Me, we get the story of brother Mike (no not a priest.. sheesh). The sibling of the two women in books Love Me (Brianna - sorry no review) and Play Me (Kiersten - reviewed). and you know it's always fun when the I am gonna stay single forever, love 'em and leave 'em type falls.. they always get so gobsmacked!!\n\nMike Worth wrote the book on how to NOT have a relationship. He even has a stop light theory. Seriously, it's hysterical. Sure he's a serious guy. Loves his sisters and is a great teacher.. A great coach, a great friend. But he saw how commitment destroyed his mother.. Ok her commitment and so not his father's.. He saw how Brianna was devastated when her first husband died and how Kiersten almost lost it when she caught her fiance (before Garret) boinking his secretary. So he has grounds to be a bit leary but this man seriously takes it to an extreme.. Until, one night in a Vegas bar, his world is totally rocked.\n\nMorgan Collins has a plan.. and it doesn't include a man. As a professional dancer she knows her career life is short. And honestly, her dreams include dancing at this point in her life. Not husband, babies and carpools. Her mother had been a prima ballerina and gave it all up for love.. Morgan knew it was the right choice for mom, but Morgan wants to live the dream before giving it up. So when she is alone in a Vegas bar and overhears this gorgeous man's stoplight theory she is on board with it. Only one night a drunken debauchery is more than a one night stand.. Seriously, this is Vegas..\n\nWaking up after a night of drunken fun and serious debauchery, when both are consenting adults should be no problem. Waking up with wedding rings.. yeah not so much.. I found this book interesting because while Mike was totally afraid of commitment, he got that there was something special about Morgan. That they had listened to an inner need, while drunk, an maybe they should give it a chance. Now talking Morgan into it is a totally different story. Morgan wasn't bitter, wasn't angry and wasn't unreasonably gun shy, she just had her own plans.. and so far no man really got that. So how could a hottie she met one night in a bar understand?\n\nI enjoyed this book.. it was a sweet, short read but it played on the magic of Vegas and the great what if? It gave a nod to the fact that there is someone out there for everyone, you just have to be open to them when they show up. AND it showed that the right person believes in your dreams and doesn't hamper them. Of course the shock and amazement that went through Morgan when she found out her hottie was a 7th grade history teacher was pretty funny.\n\nIt was also fun to see Mike interact with his friends.. and each explain to their only, non teacher friend, why his subject was the best. I liked that the men were teachers.. it just made it more fun somehow.. horn dog by night, dependable 7th grade teacher by day.. you know human..\n\nWhile, I haven't read the entire series I do think this one wrapped it all up nicely... I suggest you take some time to enjoy it all.\n\nShauni\n\nThis review is based on the ARC of Take Me, provided by netgalley"

3	'I\'m an old man and my expectations in love stories were formed a long time ago, in a shyer and less explicit age. Still, I bought a copy of "All the Things I\'ve Lost" to expand my reading scope a little. This book is the moving and affecting love story of Lee, a young man who is doubly an outsider: he\'s not only gay, he loves humans but isn\'t one of them. When he finally meets an alien man from his planet, he is distraught to find himself turning into a jerk in the relationship he wanted desperately to find. He eventually works through his problems in a believable and non-dramatic way, and learns to live with the love he can\'t change anyway. As a gay romance, this book (if you can share the author\'s enthusiasm for explicit sex) is first-rate, well-written and engaging. I\'ve given it three stars, however, because the science-fiction part of it is very weak soup, indeed. This book suffers from the "cowboys on Mars" problem -- that is, a science-fiction plot ought to be such that it couldn\'t be written any other way. Lee and his lover Dion are aliens, but nothing important would change in this book if they, like the Coneheads, were from France. Their alien culture is very lightly sketched in, and when they finally travel back to their home planet (which is not even named), it feels pretty much like visiting your lover\'s parents out in the suburbs. Overall, this is a likable, well-written love story between two men, but there\'s not much science fiction here.'

1	'After reading this short novella, I\'m not sure what exactly the plot was. I\'m a fan of Ms. Knight-Catania, and have enjoyed all her other works, but this one...it just didn\'t make sense.\nI\'ll acknowledge that when you only have a few pages to put together a romance, you can\'t weave a whole lot of depth that would normally be needed for a plot, so then a writer would use a plot that could be told quickly. This plot needed about 200 more pages, I\'m afraid.\n\nWARNING: There may be a spoiler or two, but I\'ll try to not to give too much away...\nHere are the problems: The H&h fall in love the second day they meet. She tells her best friend, who mentions she would never enter the Hero\'s house since everyone knows it haunted. Yet, the next day she disappears there??!  And by disappears, I mean like POOF. Then the story turns a corner into the paranormal. IT\'s so abrupt and odd, and they way they all the sudden had a witch that knew what to do bring her back was even stranger. Along the way, the H proposes to the h and there is a strange ceremony to make the "house" give the girl back.\n\nWhat I\'m saying here, is if you\'re a fan of J K-C, pass on this one. You\'ll only end up frustrated and disappointed. If you\'ve never read on of her books? Search her name and read one of her early books. You\'ll become a fan too.'
2	"My Opinion:\n\nThere isn't a lot of nice things I can say about this book. First I want to tell you the good things, though. I very much enjoy books that are spin offs of other famous works. Now, this spin off is pretty disappointing, but I'll get into that a bit later.\n\nMs. Denise wrote a very descriptive novel. I could clearly see the characters, setting, ect.\n\nI did not enjoy this novel. I found that it progression of evens far to slow. Everything moved at a snail's pace and the character's talked bunches of topics to death. I do not mind a long discussion on important issues in a novel, but if every topic is an hour long, sorry, but I start to yawn.\n\nThe scene where each story teller told a story took too much time. Ms. Danse should have told one or two, then faded out. I know Rolph and Tara's stories are the most important, use those.\n\nThere was something missing from this story. I'm not sure what. It was descriptive, creative (mostly), charming...And what else should it have been? No idea. Something was off. I personally liked the original Beauty and the Beast way better.  All I know is I was frustrated at the end, but kinda glad it was over.\n\nRecommendations??\n\nHmm..fairy tale lovers, Beauty in the Beast fans, steampunk fanatics, THIS IS YOUR BOOK! Give it a try, you might think differently."
3	"The House by the Lake is an okay story. Seemed all rather elementary; the character's personalities were not developed in depth. It's been over a year since I've read a novel. This book has reminded me to look for stories of at least 350 pages. Some details repeated. One incredible run-on sentence. Did the editor miss that somehow?  You will have to insert pauses where commas should be, as you read. In particular, I do not care for the style of story telling which jumps back and forth between story lines, as this book does. I skipped several chapters of the older story line. I think both parts could have been turned into separate books. Love book series.  I won't be looking for other books by this author, Ella Carey."
3	'I was reading along in this fourth book of the series and it just stopped.  No tying  up loose ends, nothing.  It was like it just stopped in the middle.  No satisfaction as it feels unfinished.'
2	"For me personally it lagged there was info I personally didn't care about. I prefer shorter more to the point books and this just felt long. I did read it entirely because I wanted to see the end but I skimmed a large chunk instead of reading. Then when it ended and I realized there was more books I screamed (verbally out loud) I won't start any more in this line"
2	'The story had little value.  TKL'
1	"I don't agree with the author that the books offered on Kindle Unlimited are all written by self publishing authors.  Most of the books I read are published by reputable  publishers and written by popular authors.  These books I have obtained through Kindle Unlimited.  I also am able to get the audio book through this same service at a much reduced rate.  I do read a great many books in a month, so that may be a consideration.  I would recommend this service."
3	'I purchased this dictionary intending to use it to replace the Oxford American my Kindle uses by default to define terms within a book or other text. The primary impetus for getting a new dictionary was the failure of the Oxford American to define some terms. I was drawn to this dictionary because the Fourth edition of the AHD had been my previous favorite, and  this was as close as I could get to the AHD, fifth ed. on my Kindle. Helping clinch my decision was the fact that the Merriam-Webster offering had fewer pages, from which I inferred that it had fewer and/or less-complete definitions.\n\nThis dictionary does define terms the Oxford American leaves out. It defined Bois de Boulogne, for example, as a park in Western Paris, which is helpful to a reader of Proust who didn\'t know that.\n\nFor two reasons, however, I ended up switching back to the Oxford American for the default Kindle dictionary. (Now, when the Oxford American either lacks a, or provides an unsatisfying, definition, I check the AHD by leaving the current book or other text, opening the AHD, and searching it.)\n\nReason One. This edition of the AHD provides no prnunciation guidance. I don\'t mean merely that it lacks a link that demonstrates pronunciation audibly--the Oxford American doesn\'t provide that either, though the CD included with the fourth edition of the AHD did, and the Kindle should be capable of providing that feature. I mean that there\'s no textual indication of how to speak a term aloud. I understand that the primary purpose for a Kindle dictionary is to define terms used in texts, but I am certain I\'m not the only reader who likes to know how to properly sound a term in his mind while reading silently. The absence of this information presumably means the dictionary provides more definitions in the same space other dictionaries use for fewer. Still, I do not find in it every term not defined in the Oxford American.\n\nReason Two. It doesn\'t provide etymology. I often look up a word I already "know" to learn where it came from and, especially if I\'m reading an older work, whether the meaning has changed. The Oxford American is pretty good with this kind of information.\n\nThe final problem affects all Kindle dictonaries, but not on Kindle devices, so it was not a cause of my switching back to the default default dictionary. It does, however, raise questions about the wisdom of buying a Kindle dictonary at all. The functionality that makes it possible to look up a word does not exist when you use the dictionary a computer via the Cloud Reader or Windos app, so the dictionary is useless as a standard reference on a computer.'
3	"I read the entire boxed set and overall it's good. It drags on after awhile and the sex scenes become redundant and boring. The author needs to spice up the lives of her characters badly and change up the vernacular of how a man comes. These books need to be edited with a fine tooth comb as well. The mistakes happened often enough to be a distraction and usually had to do with sentence structure.\n\nGetting to know the O'Connell family plus their significant others and friends Mel, John, Sarah & Chris is what these books are all about. Alastair and Jeni's ex-boyfriend are the absolute worst! The story of Jeni's ex wasn't necessary and interrupted the flow if the story. It would have been better to read a little background about his behaviors and how it affected Jeni in the present. There were too many distractions in the story like that. The same with Tim who worked at the auto shop, Chris's siblings and Jeni working at the beauty shop. None of these scenarios contributed to the book but seemed to be added to lengthen the books or added as too many thoughts the author had. Sort-of like all the crazy thoughts Sarah has planning parties, the author added all her stories into one series of books.\n\nI enjoyed the last book the most. It read like an extended Epilogue and brilliantly tied up loose ends. This series is good but could be better with help of a good editor. Someone who can focus on the family and not the unnecessary back stories for every single character. Condensing the stories into the very best parts and using a thesaurus to enhance the romance and time between the sheets. Once done, the series will be outstanding and gain rave reviews."
3	"Not quite finished with this book yet.  Seems like the family had several chances to get away - don't like books that are not smart."
2	'This is not the full version. It is a summarized kids version of the classic tale. If you want the whole story, get something else.'
3	"don't you just love fantasy. if it all were as simple and nice. I think this may have gotten a five from me if I hadn't speed read thru it. sorry but it really was just that type of book for me. the (HEA) was there but I think the whole series should of been just one book. I really can't say much without ruining it so just read it and enjoy. plus it's not fair to the writer to spoil it and say what happens.we all gotta eat and make a living."
3	'What a ride!  Had a little trouble getting into, but then, could not get away from it.\nTurns and twists galore along with wonderful clever dialog.\nJust went back and bought the whole set.'
2	"The story could have been good... However, when MOST of the characters change names, and Wyoming becomes Wisconsin then back to Wyoming, it's enough to drive you crazy!! I would have rated it a 3.5 or a 4, but the editing killed it for me. I'm a fan of the author, and have read several of her books. Unfortunately, this just wasn't on par with what I expect from her."
3	'The story here had more potential, and judging by some of the other reviewers, it did something for them.  I thought the beginning was really good, and a bit toward the end was acceptable, but the middle just kind of muddled along.\n\nI neither recommend nor not recommend this book to others.'
2	'Although I normally enjoy her books, this one at first appeared like it would be interesting but it never took off and the ending was anticlimactic.'
3	'This is not my kind of reading, but chose out of curiosity. It did not keep me as interested as I would like. Was interesting enough to make me want to finish it.'
2	"Logan is a pediatrician, but he doesn't practice medicine.  Instead, he runs a brewery (which, of course, is medically equipped to handle any emergency).  Jessie blames herself for her husband's death and has been celibate for 5 years.  They enter into a business partnership, but instead of signing a contract they have spontaneous unprotected sex on an office desk.  Jessie feels bad and slutty, but not bad or slutty enough to keep from inviting Logan to her home where she greets him wearing a silky robe.  More unprotected sex.  Jessie has a wonderful son with whom non-praticing pediatrician Logan (who loves kids, btw) immediately bonds. I did not like either Logan or Jessie, so I guess its a forgone conclusion that I didn't like this book.  The author's writing style was fine and I didn't notice any major typos or grammatical errors.  To me, this book fell flat and I probably won't be reading more from this author, free or not."
3	'Good story but you already know where it is going by the title.  Nice easy read and well written.  I do like the authors style.'

2	'I do love the Red Team and have loved every other book but this storyline was totally off the reservation.  Fanciful, dark and totally unbelievable I\'m afraid.\n\nThe responses from the Red Team at times seemed far too "touchy feely" for the type of characters they were meant to be which really annoyed me as well.\n\nI have loved the series but won\'t be back for more.'
1	'Boring as hell was not even able to get thru 50% his books are usually great.this is a looser'
2	"Im already over halfway through the second book in the series...And I couldn't NOT review it given the controversy.\n\nLet me first say, that yeah. Ive read the entire Witches of the Midwest series, and I loved them. I was intrigued at a similar plot in this, which is why I picked up the Audible boxed set. What I did NOT anticipate was a series that goes, in my opinion, FAR beyond mere similarities. Warning, potential spoilers from book 1AND 2 ahead:\n\n1. Three cousins. Three sisters. One mischievous but beloved great aunt. Three boyfriends. A friendly and fatherly sheriff who protects the family. The characters align so neatly to their counterparts as to be very blatant. Harlow is a journalist with unpredictable powers, a ghost at work, and a penchant for trouble. Aunt Cass has an illegal fireworks business (like Aunt Tillies pot field) and a fervently devotee young kid as an intern. The three mothers? All kitchen witches and known for their cooking. Three missing fathers (so far) too. Every main character is accounted for.\n\n2. The settings are incredibly alike. House on the hill that becomes a bed and breakfast. Lighthouse where major plot point happens. Cousins own a store. Even down to the frequent wacky town festivities.\n\n3. It goes deeper than framework. Aunt Cass casts the same be nice spell on one of the cousins as Tillie does to the others. And the clothes don't fit spell. So very much of the relationships and interchanges are mirrored in this series.\n\nHonestly, theres just so much. As Im listening, I keep being distracted with each new thing that feels as if it was lifted from Amanda Lees series. This goes beyond inspiration and fandom. It feels uncomfortable. If there are things I like, its because it IS from the plot of the Witches of the Midwest. These characters haven't made themselves lovable on their own merit yet, sadly."
3	"This book had action, a tough female Heroine, Dragons and Goblins.  As the first book in a series, it gives a background of the world and the life of the main character.\n\nIt was well written, and the main characters were kept to a minimum.  It was refreshing not to be overwhelmed with a barrage of characters.  The fight scenes were good.\n\nI think that a little longer book would have gone further to increase my interest.  I was just beginning to enjoy the story--and then it ended.  The Heroine seemed just a little too skilled,  and a little too lucky. The book kept  jumping back and forth between past, present, and a short paragraph that apparently was supposed to be the future.  Although that method was reasonably well done, it just didn't work so well for me, unfortunately.\n\nOverall a decent read, and I would not mind reading more of the series."
3	"cute needed a quick read & this fit the bill. I will not be reading anyone of this author's titles. There was something missing, some heat besides the sex?"
2	'Slow throughout the book.  Had great potential but just never got there.  Okay read if stranded in a cabin during a storm I guess.'
3	"well gave it three stars because it was free-by the way I'm Donald's wife Alberta he doesn't do computing much, but this book was just not much in the way of great recipes, glad I did not pay for it, short, sweet, nothing I'd cook"
3	'Decent read. Nothing special about the plot.\nKept my interest while on a plane'
3	'It was okay.  It wasn\'t bad, it just wasn\'t special.  There was nothing original in this story, and the use of non-american slang threw me out of the story a couple of times.\nI\'ve never understood the taboo about step-siblings whose parents get married when the "kids" are adults, and it really didn\'t come across as an issue here.  The main problem was the dad and the hero being afraid that the girl wasn\'t strong enough to survive it if something happened to him overseas.\nIt\'s not a disappointing read, but not one to get your hopes up for.  If you like a little military, a little angst, a little controversial/secret relationship, give it a shot.'
2	"I like to see reviews before I buy a book.  Lots of good reviews = a good book.  Well, I really wish I hadn't bought this book, luckily it was ninety nine cents.  Great premise but the heroine is a nightmare.  Non stop complaining. She complains about the way the hero saved her from being rapped and sold into human trafficking and she complains about how he runs his country when she's never been there or has not met the people.  Not every country is a democracy like America and the heroine is going to let you know how wrong that is. I couldn't finish the book honestly.  I didn't want to have to read one more complaint because apparently everything the hero does is wrong."
1	'I couldn\'t finish this book. Author seems a little cocky. "His way" is the answer (according to him) and he bashes all other fitness remedies. Several times he discusses a topic and says "more about that later." You\'re expecting to hear more in THIS book about the topic but you don\'t. This book is just an advertisement to get you to buy another book.'
2	'Very predictable.'
3	'Not as good as the others but still fun'
2	'Not really scary or freaky at all'
3	"Two  main characters with heavy baggages tried to make their relationship work. I liked the plot but I felt  distracted with so many things going on - Kara's obsession with signs and her never-ending litany of how unworthy she is as a mom, and Reid's conversation with his dead brother. I gave it 3 stars because a scene made my eyes water and really felt sad for Reid."
3	"It's an enjoyable ready but it's fairly short. The details in the book are fairly short as well wish there was a bit more."
3	"Good storyline , however had a lot of misspelled words! Talked a lot about forgiveness, healing and God's grace despite mistakes"
3	'First of all I would recommend this book to basically anyone who likes adventure. I give this book a 3 out of 5 because it is a good book and it does realistically describe what would really happen if you were lost at an airport, but -2 stars because I did not like 2 things. First I do not understand what happens at the end, if he dies or something else. And 12 days in an airport is a bit unrealistic. But apart from these things it is a fabulous book to see such a brave guy surviving an abandoned airport.'

1	'I really did  not like this book. I have read many of maya banks book and this one  in my opinion was not that interesting.'
3	'The motivation is there in this book--"God can turn people deemed TRASH into TREASURE." But just because you are a preacher doesn\'t mean you shouldn\'t learn good grammar and writing. Or at least get a friend to edit it and give some criticism.\n\nA good portion of the book is used up by quoting long Bible sections, and in italics too! And then often repeating portions of those scriptures in the exposition.\n\nThis book may be flawed, as we all are. Yet it can do a good work. The author, Pastor Joey Bauer, fits into that category and is a blessing because of that. His "Come Back Kids" is a worthy ministry. We can do a good work for others too no matter our background or character flaws.\n\nBut here\'s what makes the book a worthwhile read, lessons such as: "God is so amazing to be able to use imperfect people to do his perfect will."\n\nAnd this one: "If you remember that God uses imperfect people because he has paid the price for us on the cross, then you will begin to see God do miracles in your life. Your dreams can come true, even if you mess up from time to time."'
1	'I bought this because I (mostly) enjoyed the Bill books. This so-called book is a collection of hopefully fictional awfully written and pointless "musings". I read the entire thing hoping it would improve somewhere. Sadly, it did not.'
2	'The book is good about developing the cast of characters, and the various stresses of WW I.  However, the tale of the tank is not developed to any degree.'
1	'The book is filled with useless information.  Needs more  interesting reference material. Read the book in less than a half hour.'
3	'Interesting but rather sluggish in places.  Then it ends so you have to buy Vol 2 to read more as to her choices, if she is given any.'
2	"I didn't care for the writing style. Sorry."
1	"What a horribly written mess! The story may have been good, but darned if I know; because I couldn't get past the poorly constructed sentences and lack of editing. How disrespectful of this author to assume people would overlook such incompetence! SLA Lacey - Return to school! Do not pass 'go' and do not collect $200. Readers - Don't bother with this."
3	'i love Wizard of Oz and this is a collection and best of all this is paperless. It was cheap too!'
2	'I had read something in the NYTimes about the book and it sounded intriguing (sex and all) but the story is sort of a more erudite Gone Girl without the snarky fun. The last fifth of the novel deals entirely in plot, with wild machinations (regaining eyesight, coming out of comas, getting everything right psychologically, that sort of thing) that are simply words on the paper constructed by the author. Nobody earned these denouements! Really surprising that an editor let him get away with it.'
3	'Kind the same as the others I have read from this author. Short and ok but I would like something more in the plot.'
3	"These first Inspector Morse mysteries may not be as engaging as the later ones, but they certainly anticipate Morse's continual struggle between alcohol inspired intuition and the fact gathering his able assistant Lewis proves so able at. These stories also ably capture the tentative nature of police investigations as suspects and false hypotheses continually get discarded one after another until something like truth emerges."
2	'Finished reading but would not recommend.'
3	"It was good and as usual I enjoyed reading it, but it's not a Tuesday's w/Morie.  It's something that we all wish we could experience, however."
3	'Quite typical e-book fare.  The characters are under-developed, the action is overstated and the romantic situations are aimed at teenagers.  But it is fun and light reading and provides filler reading between consuming real novels.'
1	'The series is great but the fact that I pay $2.99 for 50-75 pages to see that there is yet another book after it has become old.'
3	"This shifter story was ok. I felt myself getting board with it and skimming parts of it through out the book. I did love the story and the characters but the idea of sacrificing a virgin....really people? so if you want a read alone book where there's no sex really no passion and a virgin sacrifice. This is the book for you. Enjoy."
3	"Super human powers, beautiful women, gorgeous hunky men, danger, romance, intrigue  enough to keep anyone on the edge of their SEAT reading non stop until the final page. This book has it all. I can't wait to\n read book 2  in the series."
1	'Was this even an interracial story. I read the sample and it was all over the place. Will not waste time with purchasing the book.'
3	"A very light read, and not quite up to par with the other John Ceepak mysteries.  A very kooky family wreaking their own special kind of havoc at a motel for a wedding.  I wasn't  pleased nor displeased with it.  It was a read, but not a thrill."
1	'This book was a slow read and lacked detail. The storyline dragged, the execution was poor & the overall outcome was not enticing enough to purchase the sequel!'
2	'Poorly written.  I agree with the reviewer  who said there was WAY too much blathering on about eating.'
3	'Cute, light, quick read, a bit predictable - I thought it ended at a quicker pace then the rest of the book.\nI would read others by this author'
3	'I really was hoping this book would have more practical examples of using dataflow blocks.  While I found the book somewhat helpful, the examples were not much better that what I could find online.  I was really looking for real-world examples and applications of dataflow technology.'
3	"This was hard to put down.  You want to continue reading to see what happens next.  Sometimes I thought there was way too much conflict in their lives but it kept me reading to find out more.  The ending is hard to take!  I can't wait to read the next  book in the series."
3	'Forge of war was a good book the characters were believable and came to life the author told a good tale'
1	"Don't buy the Kindle version of this book. Most of the chess symbols, such as 'White is better' or 'Black is better' are missing, making the evaluations of the lines worthless."
3	'For the number of pages it was hard to find the cause of the misery that held this house. Great plot but too short to elaborate.'
1	'The author sent out an email that said the book would be free if I liked it here. It charged me for it. Then, I got an email that said, "Oops! Not free today but free tomorrow." Not impressed. Get your act together! Glad it only cost me a dollar to learn this lesson. Won\'t make that mistake again.'
3	"I enjoyed the book but feel it ended too abruptly, glossing over John Chen's reign without a real lesson to be had.  If this book was finished in 2013 and had a long stay in editing, it sure didn't show (tons of spelling and grammatical errors).\n\nOn the actual story of RIM, the nonsensical dual-CEO model went on way too long.  With a single leader coupled with a proper CTO, RIM could have held off the touchscreen vendors a lot longer.  That hypothesis and story could have been told here, but wasn't.  It was just chapter after chapter of dysfunction and varying/contradictory versions of the same episode(s).\n\nBut what is most irksome is that the story on the future of RIM/BlackBerry as an EMM vendor is completely missing.  Citrix, EMC, and Good have eaten BB's lunch with secure mobile.  That part of the software + services strategy is possible - but where is it in the book?\n\nAnd how about Ford and others embracing QNX for automotive systems?  It seems like a hope and a dream in the book - not something which is already very much under way.  Microsoft failed with SYNC, and QNX has the chance to displace many others (including the abysmal Alpine systems in Acura vehicles).\n\nThe keyboard could very well make a comeback.  Apple is beginning to alienate users.  Android is predominantly down-market - lifetime value is very weak as owners spend little to none compared to Apple.  BB has a chance to re-emerge - this book just didn't give it any hope."
3	"It's good, but you will not learn a lot of new things."
1	'This was good but very disappointed as to the ending. Where and how did she live after. Did he get punished. To many question not told. Need a follow up book.'
2	'I love time travel books and historical fiction. That said, I had lots of issues with this series.  Most any American could tell you that Jamestown was a barely viable colony for many years after its founding in 1607.  The author describes a scenario in colonial Virginia that would be more accurate for the mid- to-late 1600s. I realize this is a fantasy, but the timeline not being right was very distracting.  I also found it a bit hard to believe how everyone was jumping into bed, regardless of the consequences.  Usually people at least pause first!  I had a hard time especially believing that teenage girls would be so anxious to toss away their "virtue".  Then, in book 4, it describes a homosexual situation, and that\'s where I quit reading. I really don\'t want to know any more about this family. I\'m disappointed. There were some good elements to the story, a good amount of action, and character development, and found the sisters likeable. This is definitely an adult series, so if you\'re not into the graphic stuff, this is a good series to skip.'
3	'I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. So here is my review.\n\nI have given this book 3.25 stars. I cannot give it anymore then that. This book took me almost a full month and a half to read 300 pages of this book. It starts off sooo slow. It kinda drove me nuts a little bit. I almost just closed this book and never picked it up again. If you do read this push through it for a bit. It took me until I hit around chapter 7 before I actually wanted to continue reading it, before it was just kinda garbled.\n\nThe plot with this book isn\'t that bad. There\'s a love triangle and a damsel in distress, there\'s the "evil doer" who really isn\'t that evil, he\'s just dealt with a shitty hand at life and is just trying to make the most out of it. The damsel in distress, well she\'s kinda cute in that useless sort of way, and then you get to the hero of the story (only in the beginning though) and he\'s made out to be this under emotional character that just has a bit of depth in him to keep everyone interested, especially the damsel.\n\nThe more you get into the story the more it sort of makes sense, the first few chapters like I said are really garbled and confusing, and SLOW!! Oh wow was it so slow to actually get into this story for me. I stuck through it though and I just finished it, and I\'m honestly hoping that there is another one, another part to this series. I would love to see the adventures that she could come up with.\n\nI want to thank the author Melanie Crouse, and Rachel Marks for giving me the opportunity to read and review this book. As always all opinions are of my own and do not reflect the author or the publisher in any way.\n\nSUPPORT YOUR LOCAL INDIE AUTHORS!'
2	"I wasn't into this much."
1	"In case you don't want spoilers, please don't read on ahead.\n\nNow that I've gotten that out of the way, let me begin.\n\nFirst off this novel, novella left me with a disease ridden mouth in need of some holy water to cleanse it. The thing with this book, the menage didn't work for me. It just didn't. I've read menage and the ones that made me love the world was that in the menage relationship there was exclusivity between the menage. The orgy thing definitely not my cup of tea. Out of all this, I felt sorry for Jerry. Jerry could've been subjugated to a potential sex riddled disease. Ellie should've just broke it off with him before they did the horizontal. I hope Jerry didn't get any STD's. I felt as if all of them could've been potential STD carriers. At the end of the book, I felt as if Ellie and Shakira were just sexual doormats for the guys/guy.\n\nI won't be continuing on with this series at all. No thank you."
3	"Reviewed by Robin\nReview copy provided by publisher\n\nBeing intrigued by werewolves I thought that Chasing Cassie would be right up my alley. Yes, there were werewolves. Yes there was also plenty of hot sex.\n\nWe first meet Cassie Calington lusting for the Jay Chance an enforcer for the Shadow peak pack. Cassie finally finds a man who makes quiver, her heartbeat race and her body sizzle and he is a werewolf. Better yet he doesn't even know that she exists.\n\nJay has his eyes set for Dusty another enforcer in their pack. Cassie tries to help Jay get Dusty to notice him but Dusty wants nothing to do with him.\n\nWerewolf and human can they co-exist? Cassie would like to think so. Cassie thinks Jay is still wanting Dusty but Jay saw Cassie upset at a BBQ at Laney's and goes after her realizing he wants Cassie.\n\nThe heat is so explosive that clothes are torn off and wild passionate sex...Let's just say HOT...HOT...HOT!\n\nThe bookstore that Cassie is opening with Jay's sister Laney is bombed. Sending Cassie on the run to get away from Jay who she thinks is still after Dusty.\n\nShe settles into the town where Laney once lived making new friends and running into a strange man who later claims to be her brother. Throughout this who ordeal she settles into her new life only to have Jay follow her there.\n\nHot...Sex...Delicious.\n\nAnd still more Hot Sex.\n\nI would have loved more of a storyline for Cassie and Jay. The characters were developed and the basics given but then they are mostly in bed. That isn't a bad thing but I would have liked to see more of the werewolf changing and more on what Jay actually does. Cassie goes from being half owner of the bookstore to waitressing.\n\nThere were so many other characters introduced that I found it difficult to follow at times.\n\nThe sex was hot. A quick read. Not something that I would read again."

1	'Why do I keep wasting my money on these cheap ebooks ? A few silly pages about the types of water to drink or not drink, a few links to websites and that, as they say, is that. I can not believe anyone would bother publishing such garbage, I am horrified that so called ebooks like this let the whole genre down. Wish I could rate it in the minus !'
2	"this is nothing  compared to any seiries I have read from rick\n riodan. In this series,percy jackson is not as mature as in heroes of Olympus and they met the kane family from kane\nchronicles wich I hate. But what I hate the most is that percy met new friends and the friends in the previous series are all forgoten. I wish percy has the same main friends for every series\n\n(I don't know how to spell series)"
3	"It wasn't a bad read. It isn't my cup of tea, which is fine. I kept getting confused by characters and some of the scenes felt off for me. I don't read a lot of M/M, not that's there's anything wrong with it it just doesn't catch my attention. Over all, definitely worth giving it a try."
1	"The book started out like a poorly written first person then went into sounding like I was reading someone's itinerary then moved into a fair improvement from the initial first few chapters. While it was nice to get the whole story in one book, it really didn't flow well."
3	'The book is kind of short but has potential.  There were moments in the book where I was intrigued with what would happen next and then I would find myself saying, "really?".  Parts of the book become quite predictable and other parts are annoying.  I did read it from start to finish in 1 day and was glad of the ending but would question reading another book similar to it.'
1	'Teaser... Very short intro to something maybe..'
3	'This book was a little hard for me to stay interested in. But once I kept going it was interesting.'
1	'I feel I was lenient with the first book of this series.  As it was her first book I had hoped she would learn from all those mistakes.  This book was worse even than the first one.  Shawn somehow grew an inch between the time this book was written and the first one was.  In the first book she was 6 feet tall.  This book has her at 6\'1".  Marti in the former book became Marty, then was switched back to Marti.  Typos are quite abundant and words are totally dropped so often that reading is beyond frustrating.  The story line is blurred and not well thought out.  Worst of all, this is not a stand-alone book.  If you want to read this book it will be mandatory to first read the previous book in this series and to finish this story you will have to read the last book.  All three are a total waste of time.  Unless you are a friend of this author, forget reading these books.  Its written down to a grade school level which makes it even worse.  This author definitely made it onto my list of authors to avoid!'
2	'I got tricked by the cover again... Thought it was a game.. obviously not. Is there a rule that disallows these people to copy the artwork of a game cover and make it theirs...'
3	'interesting read'

3	'This was spellbinding but then you were left hanging. I was quite disappointed. Hopefully the new book will not leave you suspended in mid air'
3	'Review can also be found in chillandreadblog.wordpress.com/2016/09/13/son-of-a-duke-by-jessie-clever\n\nSocietys most capable housekeeper, the infallible Miss Eleanora Quinton, has a problem. Not only does a dead body fall right into the middle of her mistresss ball and her son gets kidnapped, the only person who can help her also forces her to face her most crippling fears.\n\nThe heroin is a woman that has suffered a lot, away from her family, serving her aunts family and now a house in London for more than 10 years now. She is known to the house and her maids as strict and infallible and she is treated with respect. Turns out she is known to her mistresss peers.\n\nThe story starts with a murder during a ball. A mystery kind of book that evolves to a historical romance. The beginning is very promising and the reader expects to find a really good plot and a couple of twists just around the corner. As a matter of fact, the story line is a good one, even though one would not expect that housekeepers get noticed by the peerage, but yet again, this is fiction we are talking about. It could continue really good and turn to a very interesting book, if it wasn\'t written in a hurry At least this is what sums up.\n\nIt is an easy read. The hero, Nathan, is a real hero in the book and is described as that. He is displayed to be thoughtful and caring, apart from being a spy and a brave man. His actions are up to the formed character. The heroine, Nora, is a woman that rarely smiles. She is running her staff on a firm hand. Somehow, these two fell in love quickly enough to get married in-spite of the common logic.\n\nThe story evolves surprisingly fast. All obstacles come clear miraculously. There should be some more development on the action/spy scenes. They would provide that special touch to make the book something more than a purely love story. There is room for improving and addressing a wider audience. Yet again, this is up to the author to take into account.\n\nThe book was provided as a prize of the "Big Summer Reading Giveaway" hosted by the author.'

3	"This book was a YA and I really enjoyed it. It was just maddening at times because we all knew how it was going to end. EVERYBODY knew who he was....we all knew he was the drummer to Willow Creek. I get that works for the title, Last to Know but really? It was a little predictable. I guess  I wished for a little more surprise. To me it was all a waiting game for when she found out. I kept holding my breath. Don't get me wrong...I liked the story, I did. I just wanted it to be....more. I'm still planning on reading more in the series. I mean I loved the other guys. I'm just keeping my fingers crossed that with these NA books they will be a little less predictable."
1	'I never order this book !'
3	"There were times when author wasn't clear in transitioning chapters into past or current. It was very confusing to figure out what was actually happening in the story. Also, there was a lot of typos. However, the story was filled with drama and suspense which kept me interested."
3	'I decided to read this book based on all the great reviews it got.  I would say I liked the story but didn\'t actually love it so it was disappointing.  The writing was done really well and the storyline was great but I didn\'t feel any connection to either Olivia or Paul.  In fact, they both kind of annoyed me with how juvenile they were.  Olivia\'s "secret" wasn\'t a big deal at all so the idea of her having to do penance was ridiculous.  I liked Paul\'s character a little better, just out of sympathy for what he had gone through, but that didn\'t excuse how awful he was.  I will still read another book by this author with the hope that I am more engaged in the story.'
2	"The beginning was SO promising. It has everything that I dreamt of in a fiction novel; a dependent and smart main female character, being stuck together for a period of time, and a male character that we could actually see developing. I found myself living the book more and more. This was definitely a page turned that I found myself reading until the early hours of morning. It was so so promising... until it just came crashing down. I could literally see the storyline just spiraling down and then crashing and burning. Once I got to the middle, the story got so predictable and the main character just shifts to a whole other person! She used to be smart had lots of common sense and towards the ending, she just became dense and an idiot. I had to take multiple breaks from the book and eventually just gave up on it. I cannot see how people are able to finish this book, nonetheless giving it good ratings. If it weren't for the amazing beginning, I've would've easily just gave this book a one star."
2	"Received an arc for review\n\nLet's see...sex, more sex, page of other stuff, sex, sex, watching people have sex, couple more pages of her, sex, sex, stuff about him, sex, end. I really got nothing else to say."
3	'good reading'
3	"Compared to the other books in this series, which I own and love, this was a huge disappointment! The story between Paul and Charity was the typical clichd plot I've read in countless historical romance books...I'll stress again, so unlike the other stories. Charity got on my last nerve and I felt no sympathy for her at all!  The story boiled down to her expectations of the hero where she placed him on a pedestal, and then made him responsible for fixing her insecurities and her feelings for him by holding his past as her bosom buddy. I felt like Ms. Calloway didn't even believe in their relationship because she included all the characters from the series to help move this insipid romance along.  I loved them in their respective books, but they took up too much space in this one and irritated me with their banal behavior (again, so popular in historical romances) where the women, satisfied and smug in their happy matches, sided with the wallflower in bemoaning how she was the best thing for Paul, and the neutered husbands naturally admonished Paul on his conduct.\n\nAdmittedly, there were some touching moments especially towards the end where it wrapped up predictably sweet and neat, however, the actual love story was unbelievable for me.\n\nI am still a fan of Ms. Calloway's writing and I would recommend her books, even this one, despite my disappointment."
3	"I read the book in an evening. Mostly because I skipped over all of the MANY reasons given for avoiding wheat. And that's mainly what the book offers- reasons not to consume wheat. It all made great sense to me, I tried it and saw an immediate improvement in mental clarity, and my bloated belly disappeared. I even lost a few pounds without changing anything else.\n\nI would recommend it for sure. But only three stars because it was a tad bit dry for reading."

3	'In the interest of full disclosure, I must first reveal that I was a personal friend of Lyle May\'s victims, Valerie and Mark (referred to as "Veronica" and "Mikey" in this book). When I learned that Lyle had written a book about his life both before and after death row, I was immediately torn between feeling disgust that he had the gonads to utilize his infamy to generate publicity for himself and feeling a desperate need to understand how this man could have ruthlessly slaughtered a young mother and 5 year old son in the most sickening way imaginable in 1997. Against my better judgment, I purchased the $2.99 Kindle edition longing for some kind of understanding of something so senseless (and perhaps some closure?) and hoping to learn that Lyle was at the bare minimum remorseful for his actions. In the end, the results, for me, were a mixed bag.\n\nLyle is clearly a good writer, assuming that he wrote the book himself, and you can imagine that he could have been a successful person in life had he made better choices. The book flows very well from the time he is a young boy all the way through the last few years locked up. I felt detached from the story initially as his early years take place in Maine, far away from the Blue Ridge Mountains in North Carolina, the backdrop of the eventual murders. Indeed, had I not known where his story was headed, I think I actually could have enjoyed his writing.  However, I, unfortunately, knew exactly where the story was headed and as a result, I felt a sense of foreboding and impatience, wanting to get to the part where he crosses paths with Valerie and Mark.\n\nThe author writes in an introspective way and it appeared that he was quite revealing of his past indiscretions and delinquency of his youth. You really feel empathy for his parents and family while reading this account for they seemingly tried everything (and then some) any reasonable parent would try with a boy who was resistant to any sort of intervention. They are victims in this, also. When Lyle finally gets to the point where he meets his victims, Valerie and Mark, I was disappointed by his characterization of them. He makes it clear that Valerie was disposable, just someone he met while at a psychiatric hospital and someone that he would have preferred not to be around (I\'m paraphrasing). However, he and his sidekick, Darrell Godfrey, certainly found uses for Valerie including using her as a personal (unpaid) taxi, getting money, and partying with her. Thus, his descriptions of the people he murdered were not kind and seemed unnecessary. Indeed, he extends no more than a cursory nod toward the destruction he caused family and friends of the victims, some who will read this book.\n\nLyle seems to have an excellent memory for numerous details of his childhood and teenage years, both while sober and either self-medicated or medicated by shrinks. Unsurprisingly, the one exception to this is the couple of days around the time of the murders. Lyle writes that he experienced both "black outs" and "grey outs" on the day of and apparently, the day after the murders as a result of too much booze, psychotropic medications, and weed. How convenient. Thus, he reportedly has no memory of the apparent conflict before the murders, the actual murders, the dumping the bodies along the Blue Ridge parkway, being arrested by the police, or even his confessions to the police afterward. According to this document (http://caselaw.findlaw.com/nc-supreme-court/1216341.html), Lyle not only confessed verbally but also in writing in his own handwriting. Darrell Godfrey also confessed that Lyle killed both Valerie and Mark and that Darrell helped dispose of the bodies. Interestingly enough, Lyle seems to throw Darrell under the bus by inferring that Darrell might have killed the victims (because remember, Lyle can\'t remember anything). Thus, this is another disappointing point in this book; Lyle simply does not take responsibility for the murders in any way. In his mind, because he does not remember murdering Valerie and Mark, perhaps he is not guilty (regardless of his confessions, all the forensics, and Darrell Godfrey\'s testimony). He also seems to suggest that even if he did commit the murders when he was high on drugs and alcohol and doesn\'t remember the events, perhaps his sentence is too severe. Lyle also shows clear resentment that Darrell was released from prison in 2010.\n\nHe subsequently writes a lot about how the media had biased the judicial process resulting in his conviction, the dehumanizing aspect of death row, that he feels he is "more" than those acts of murder (and infers he should be judged by others as more than that), and that he strongly believes capital punishment should be abolished. I believe Lyle\'s purpose in publishing this book is mostly self-serving and two-fold; to cast some doubt on his conviction (the Darrell Godfrey theory) and then to rally against capital punishment. The ironic part for me, a friend of Valerie and Mark who were brutally murdered by Lyle, is that I mostly agree with his stance against capital punishment. I would be perfectly content seeing Lyle living out the rest of his days apart from society, for 2 instances of the worst crime you can impose on humanity. However, it is my hope that Lyle will some day truly understand the pain and hurt, and all the lives that he destroyed with his unfortunate choices. Beyond denying Valerie and Mark a future, Lyle never mentions anything about their family or friends. Perhaps he didn\'t know any of them in the brief time he knew Valerie and Mark.  I wonder if he has ever even attempted to reach out to them? Valerie\'s mother, Virginia, and her husband were absolutely shattered at the death of their only daughter and grandson. So while Lyle spends a lot of time in the book advocating and generating sympathy for his plight, he should have included a chapter about the effects that his actions had on other people in the world. Maybe he can add it to his new online blog? Somehow, I doubt we\'ll ever see that in his writing. In the meantime, if Lyle ever has any doubt about "How the hell did I end up on death row?" I would like to refer him to this link:http://image1.findagrave.com/photos/2010/138/52595691_127431119350.jpg'

3	"3.5 stars\nCopy courtesy of Netgalley\nThis is the second in the series. A standalone with a HEA. I really enjoyed the first book in the series and was looking forward to reading this one. I was really looking to see the same formula. The first book had more lighter and made me laugh. This one was different. It was a lot sexier. It was still a pretty clean romance. I liked both characters. Alice was a little naive but I liked that she stuck to her guns when she found out about Tomas. She was nice without be a doormat. Tomas was the typical young hot star athlete. He enjoyed the benefits and didn't make excuses. He was a gentleman to Alice. A plus to this book is that we get to visit with Mia and Lucas again. You get to see Mia's influence on Lucas.\nshort read  with very little angst."
3	"This story is written in a very quaint but intriguing style and I'm not really sure how to describe it. I suspect the author was trying to be authentic to the time period, which I appreciate. The book was clean, which I also appreciate. At times I found it a little 'twee' and a little too cute. I had some issues with the storyline which cost the book a star.\n\n***Spoilers***\nThe H inherits a fortune and a castle in Scotland from a distant relative. He goes to Scotland to claim the lairdship and meets the h along the way. The h is the daughter of a nobleman who is trying to sell off his daughter to pay his gambling debts. The proposed husband is a lecher and the h wants nothing to do with him so she attempts to find work as a chef. The H meets her at an inn where she is working and rescues her from the awful wife of the owner. Along the way he discovers her heritage and pretty shortly afterwards he marries her. It's not a terribly romantic tale but it is sweet. The part I had a problem with is that 2 con artists arrive to try and cheat their way into taking the castle and the fortune. I didn't find it at all credible. What saved it from disaster is that the author made the H very cunning in his dealings with the villains."
1	'I chose this book because I was intrigued by the interesting premise of an alien hiding out on earth. By the end of the first chapter I knew this book was in trouble. In fact, for a short time I thought I might actually be reading a parody of a bad sci-fi novel. Giving the author the benefit of a doubt, I gamely stuck with it until mid way through chapter 11 when the incredible galactic busboy was thinking of heading off to Florida to join the PGA to help raise money to fund the building of his starship.\n\nNot a literary genius myself, I find it hard to put into words how bad this book actually is.'
3	"This is a very short book.  It assumes that the parent knows nothing which I find insulting.\nI also completely disagree with the suggestions about tantrums. This is something that every\nparent needs to extinquish as soon as possible.  I don't believe in ignoring the problem in\nthe store or out in the public.  This is highly annoying to other people.\n\nI have a much better solution and it worked on all 3 of my kids.  When a kid uses a temper\ntantrum it is them trying to force the parent to give them what they want through negative\nreinforcement of the parent by screaming and also embarrassing the parent.  It is really\nvery simple to extinquish this behavior at home so that you don't need to  do it in\npublic.  When the kid cries, you keep a glass of cold water in the fridge.  At the\nfirst start of a temper tantrum you quietly go the fridge, remove the glass of cold\nwater and throw it in the child's face.  It activates their startle response and the cold\nwater is a negative reinforcer stronger than the crying.  It only takes a few times\nof this and the kid will get the message that temper tantrums are going to be\nvery uncomfortable  for them.  When you establish this early on, it is like\ntraining a puppy.  The puppy and the kid will figure out that you are the\nalpha person not them and they will stop the negative behavior.\n\nThe other problem with this book is that it is very short, not a book\nat all but a chapter.  The book did nothing to really cover the trials\nand tribulations of adolescence including talking to your kids about\nsex and drugs and drinking.\n\nIn all I was very disappointed in this booklet as I am in the field\nand I don't agree with much of this book.\n\nThe reviewer is the author of the new Kindle book entitled:\nSex Education for Adults Secrets To Amazing Sex\nAnd Happily Ever After  Too"
3	'As with any book of short stories, the amount that I liked the individual stories varied.  I liked some of them and did not like others.  I do think that this book is worth purchasing as it is very inexpensive and therefore even if one only likes some of the stories it is still good value for money.'
1	"It has been awhile since I read a good book where the characters became friends I wanted to be with.\nThis is one of those books.\nI'll read more by this author."
3	'It was ok.  The illustrations were helpful for most part.  But, it seemed to be wrote for older children.  At times, was hard to figure out.\n\nI did receive a discount in exchange for honest review.'
3	'it was ok but not enough new information.'
2	"Overall, I didn't really like this book. Whilst there were in fact a couple of moments that I quite enjoyed while reading this book and there were also a couple of quotes I found sorta cool. But that is where my attraction stops. I can see where everyone came from when they tweeted/made people aware of the problems in this book. I could see the racism and the fact that people who suffer from chronic pain were offended. Unfortunately, I wasn't as greatly affected by these factors than those who found the book offensive. I am grateful that I was made aware of these things because if I am being honest, I probably would have ignored these problems and found this book somewhat good. I am grateful for people who voice their opinions because sometimes, it makes people like me more aware. Now knowing these things about this book, I hope that I can become more critical when I read. With that being said, I would like to thank Jonathan Ball Publishers for sending me this book. I am grateful that I didn't have to spend money on a book that was problematic and I am grateful that they sent me this book. I think this review was more rant-like than anything else but this really was a special book, and there are no positive connotations to the word special in this case."
3	"The title says it all. It was very dark. I chose it because it was a free book of the month so I went ahead and read it. I am still thinking about some of the more disturbing aspects of the story. It is about child abuse, plain and simple. No matter what you have done, you do not deserve what his sister went through. I was really disappointed with the protagonist's reaction to all that had happened. I still read it to the bitter end because it was written well enough even though the circumstance seemed highly implausible."
2	"I gave this book 2 stars because I don't like; however, I don't hate it. This is more storytelling in the third person instead of an actual novel. Like the previous review I think the writer should develop their writing style more. I didn't get past the first few pages. This book is missing a storyline and has lack of character development. The main character Loretta I thought was a weak willed woman; however, there are many of these types of woman in real life so I get it. I won't count this author out yet."
3	'I wanted to read the book based on the 2012 movie...this is NOT IT. However, I am enjoying this story. I hope it ends well.'
3	'A classic.  I had never read it and although it is essentially a book for children, I did enjoy it. Happy ever after just like the best fairy tales.'
3	'Overall, I found this to be an entertaining Sci-Fi yarn. It had some very intriguing ideas on advanced species, alien/earth tie-ins and psionic powers.'
3	"This book has hints of being written between 1900 and the 1920s by a woman of the upper middle to lower upper class, but one definitely from the Leisure Class.  Helene Barker attacks the Washington D.C. laws regulating industrial cleaning employees, but ignoring domestic cleaning employees who were 'abused' by lack of regulations that led to unfair pay, extraordinarily long work days, and sometimes harsh demands by the employer.  Barker in turn begins her book with the argument to leisure housewife, who have servants, that if they run their home more like a business then there will be increased economic and financial benefit, and lays out her theories along with examples from her life or those of her friends.\n\nI gave the book three stars because I appreciate that the problems of scheduling, the efficiency of work to be done, living arrangements, foreign domestic employees, and maintaining the dignity of the employee are still current, at least according to the acquaintances I have who employ domestic help.  There are laws now that protect these employees' rights.  That aspect has changed.  The book sale gives an interesting insight into the lives of women at the turn of the last century both of the working class, but alas of the elusive class in some of the anecdotes."
3	'I liked the story but to me it held no twist or unexpected  turns it was entertaining but to me it was just a  common plot and a common ending, I enjoyed anyway.'
3	'Nothing new as far as information about diet, exercise, medication and diabetes goes. All four areas need to be covered and this book was pretty limited to foods and a wee bit about the rest.'
1	'Would have liked a little more info about her abilities . I believe they could have made it all into one book. This seems like just a chapter of her info about herself that led nowhere. Kind of dissapointed . Should have bought a different book with more detail into her life.'
3	'Gads, Sean and Scarlett drove me nuts. Good example of needing to really KNOW a person vs going for sex first. Oh sure, Scarlet knew Sean for a long time but did she truly really KNOW him? They argued , Scarlett ran away vs growing up and was very spoiled. I found much of the sex talk very repetitive, though in some parts it was a part of their "jokes".Interesting and funny relationship with her brother and at end of third book, that came in a boxed set, finally a story evolves ....and, OF COURSE,  leaves ya hanging! Hate that! I think the author should state there is a cliff hanger...readers deserve to know\nBut I just get ticked off and go read another author.'
3	'A chronicle of the families and the various leaders that have ruled Venice with almost no economical, demographic or geographical data. Interesting to read. But definitely an incomplete picture.'
3	'I enjoyed the book. But, it drags out.'
3	'A lot of typos and missing info but still a good read. Nice short story. Def a short story to be categorized as young paranormal romance.'
3	'Not very good. OK for a quick read, but not up to Evanovich standards'
1	"Bad Bad Bad don't bother to read this book! There is no real connection between the characters..... Matter of fact the characters don't draw you in at all! The story has potential but the writer doesn't know how to  put it all together so it flows smoothly! I was so disappointed in this book I didn't even finish reading it!!!!"
3	"***I was given a copy by the author for my honest opinion - goodchoicereading dot com***\n\nGeorgia Cates is an author that I will forever read her books. Shallow is the third book I've read by her, and I enjoyed it a lot. Maybe not as much as the first in the series, Going Under, but it was entertaining enough for me to finish in one sitting.\n\nPayton, to me, is a well written character. I loved her and was able to relate to her in a lot of ways. She is a great example of what female characters should be like. There were so many scenes where I would think to myself I would do this or I would say this, and sure enough Payton did. She wasn't this weak little girl who let others control her or walk all over her. If she were real, we would be best friends. I'd make sure of that.\n\nHer relationship with Nick was a great tease, but a good one. Things would happen at the right moment, and every time he thought he was pulling a fast one on Payton, she called him on his crap and took him by surprise. I loved it! They were perfect for each other. Nick wasn't overbearing or way too cocky for his own good. He was a little pinch of everything. That is the best way I can describe him. Of course he was super yummy as well. I was practically blushing with every chapter.\n\nOf course I do have some complaints, but it's not anything that I feel would ruin the book for readers.\n\nGeorgia Cates introduces some serious family issues in Shallow and I felt that each time she did, I was tricked. I thought the story would get intense and severe, but each issue that was presented was sort of ignored within the next couple of paragraphs. I kept waiting for the topic to be touched again, but it really wasn't, so that bothered me a bit. Other than this, though, the story was great. I laughed a lot and found myself not wanting to put the book down.\n\n3.5 out of 5 stars!"
3	"Loved the beginning of the story and couldn't put it down. I could have done without the lesbian theme and the supernatural way they had to conceive children."
2	'This is the third book in the series and of the three is the most juvenile. The heroine is supposed to be this open minded free-spirited doctor. But somehow comes across as extremely crass.  I liked Rusche  but his speech was very elementary and he seemed extremely young.  . Overall, it took me a while to read this book because it became annoying every few pages\n. Not to mention that the way Brandt was portrayed made me really not like him.'
3	"First and foremost, Write For Me was a funny read :) The main character, Bently, hasn't has the best luck when it comes to romance. At first it seemed like she was going to be bitter about it but instead she was freaking hilarious. After swearing off guys Bently meets Josh at a party. At first she hates him  that was more due to bitterness  but pretty soon they have a friendship that worked well. Theres a lot of underlying tension because both Josh and Bently know they want more than friendship but the banter they have together made me laugh so much! It was good ;)\n\nIve mentioned that Bently is funny as hell but she was also realistic. Having said that, not very far into Write For Me Bently faces tragedy in her life and sadly I didn't think her emotions were that believable. Sometimes Bently seemed to forget about what had happened and was completely obsessed with Josh. I just wanted Bently to calm down sometimes! It seemed like she was going at full throttle for the whole book and completely overreacted to situations when it wasn't necessary. Also, at the end of the book Bently does something which I though was unacceptable. Josh thinks so too but then it is all forgiven  personally, I think she got off the hook way too easily.\n\nAs for Josh, he was super sweet ;) Sometimes his dialogue was too flowery and poetic but to be honest I didn't mind too much. While Josh was could banter like anything with Bently he is also protective and cares a lot about her.\n\nAnyway, Write For Me was a fun read and is so worth it just for the laughs! But as well as the funny moments there are also serious aspects that make this book more than a light summer read.\n\nNew Adult\n3.5 stars\n\n**Thank you, Michelle Holt, for providing me with a review copy! All views and opinions are my own and I was not compensated in any way.**"
3	"I'm usually not into mermaid like tales. However, I thought this had quite a realistic feel to it (as far as mermaids and realism go).  They were truly half fish/half human. None of that Splash nonsense where all you have to do is dry off the fins and they grow legs. Nope, the fish portion stayed fish, and they even reproduced like fish. Weird? Yeah... but totally believable.\n\nThe style of Awakening was presented a bit differently than Ms. Thomas' other works. In fact, I thought I was reading a prologue of sort when I started, as the front was loaded with background information. It didn't take long to realize I was in the actual story, and Nerina was narrating. Another interesting note about the style: this work had a feel to it as if Nerina was reminiscing about past events. That is, her story was already said and done, but she wanted to tell her experience so she wouldn't be forgotten. Different. I don't know if that was the author's intent or not, but it made me think of reading someone's diary.\n\nLike the Auction, Awakenings was quite a bit milder as far as the BSDM goes. In fact, the BDSM was implied it would happen in the future rather than occurring onscreen. Instead, Awakening focused on coaxing Nerina into becoming a sexual being rather than dominating her. No spoilers here, so you'll have to read Awakening for yourself to see how that works out.\n\nThough this was a short work, which was fine, I had hoped for more. Without giving anything away, the ending didn't quite give me the closure I'd hope for. All the issues were addressed, but one item seemed to be left in limbo.\n\nI received this work from the publisher in exchange for a review."
1	'While this review requires 20 words or more, such a rule does not apply where fewer words will suffice elsewhere.'
1	'Too many plot lines. Some are ok. Others just seem like something from a comic book.'
2	'The premise to these short stories is kinda unique. The F.B.I. is hunting down not just serial killers but people who are no longer people but an infection that mimics humanity but kills humanity.'
3	"I was a little disappointed that there wasn't more content but it was free so Great background to The Path."
1	"This book is good as hell which is why I'm so mad. Why are we still waiting for part 2 tho? This chick always on IG posting dumb stuff. This the LONGEST I ever waited for a part 2 if u couldn't commit in doing it in a timely manner why not just do a stand alone smh"
2	'The author has a solid story line base to work start. However, the editing on all these books (I\'ve read 1-9 in hopes of improvement) is absolutely horrendous! I am so disappointed in manor these are written. There are repeated words (same subject written 3-4 different ways in the same sentence), words that are extra (repeated or misplaced) and words that are down right wrong (sentence calls for "reins" of a horse but author uses "reigns" instead, sentence calls for "thrown" but author uses."throne"). Give these a very good edit with some rearrangement of paragraphs and you will have a great story. As of now, it\'s just a mediocre one.'
2	'I wished I had more details in cleaning a home such as contracts,  what if they have pets (how to set the price).  I wish there was more knowledge.'
3	'Very hard to read.  Got to be boring but finished the book anyway'
1	"Book one...good. Book two...a chore just to get halfway. The bickering back and forth on and on...BORING. And I don't read about a pathetically weak heroine"
1	'I am not a reviewer as a general rule, but I knew I had to change my ways  with this book when, in the first paragraph the h describes herself as "gluten for punishment".  Somewhat ironic when you consider she is a baker!!!  Unfortunately, she does not change during the book and she is a whiny at the end, as she was in the beginning.  The H is obnoxious and creepy, and even though he reforms at the end there is not much redeeming about him.  Whoever edited this needs a kick in the shins.'
2	'Not detailed enough but good for quick study.'
2	'Not as good as the first one.'
3	'I felt like the book drew me into the story, but then it left me with too many unanswered questions. Maybe I missed something.'
3	"I have been looking for a way to make extra income. I wasn't sure if selling online was for me. I think it is."
3	"The constant references to food made me want to put this book down on more than one occasion.  I stuck with it only to see how the murder was solved.*  If Amy wasn't eating, drinking, or baking something, she was thinking about eating, drinking or baking something.  And, my goodness, the over use of analogies to food was annoying.  Examples from just the first two chapters:\n The hot sunshine made her feel like a salmon roasting on a cedar plank.\n It felt like her body had been sprinkled with spicy, tingly, Szechuan pepper.\n Carla would pounce on the admission like a feral cat on a roasted chicken.\n more unpleasant than a dozen deviled eggs left on a hot car all day.\n like batter covered chore devils perched on her shoulder.\nOn and on they went throughout the entire book.  I cannot recommend it to anyone except those who love culinary analogies with a little mystery thrown in.\n*Three stars because the ending was refreshing  the heroine actually left it up to the police to catch the murderer instead of putting herself in peril as with so many other cozy endings"
3	"I loved the character depth, it's impossible to be bored with so many characters to love. Like abracadabra, I especially loved Jude's persistence for Autumn, this was a great love story."
1	"Just a bad story all around. Don't waste your time. There are better pieces of fiction for free on archive of our own."
2	'not free and I understand the sunday times crossword puzzle is not included. It may be a good ap but I did not want to purchase.'
1	"O no!  Not only was it awful, but the editor allowed hundreds of distracting foolish syntax errors, grammar faults and other stupidities (presents for presence, to for too, your for you're).  And I finally plowed through to the end & it was as if the writer (could not be the adult Charles Todd) was trying to end on deadline.  I couldn't really understand the ending!"
3	'I like the story but it could have been great with more depth. However it was still a nice read.'
3	'Not the type of book I would normally pick. I was looking for something different.'
1	"Nothing you can't find on the internet"
3	'Not much of a story, but it sets up Rogue One:  A Star Wars Story pretty effectively.'
1	"I only read the first 5 pages it was so bad. It is written by a man from POV of a woman. After I'd had to read the first couple of pages twice, and I was only on page 5, to figure out what might be going on, I had had enough!"
3	"Hmmm. The blurb does give everything away but I don't mind that because it keeps the story low angst.\n\nThis is a decent read and the most interesting thing about it is the idea why we are cruel when we are young.\n\nThe romance is lack luster because the book kind of ends when the real relationship would begin.\n\nStill a great setting and cast."
1	'Very little useful information given by the author...'
1	"Terrible quality. Looks like it was printed on a crappy inkjet from the early 2000's."

3	'There is some imagination in several of the recipes. You might have to improvise to suit your taste, but I would recommend it.'
1	'I hate that I paid money for this book. The two main characters don\'t talk to each other for most of the book yet somehow they fall in love in the end. How?  They know nothing about each other, he\'s never around her, she is crushing on another guy... I don\'t get it. I usually love "you have to marry me books because..."  but this one was horribly written. Don\'t read this, it\'s a waste of time and money.'
3	'Short Story for sure without the normal action and play that I have come to expect from this author. Read it in a couple hours due to interuptions'
3	"This series takes a different route to the post-dystopian future. Our hero and his crew must deal with an ice age that settles in practically overnight. The premise is somewhat thought provoking, but the speed of the weather change and our hero's ability to cope tend to be somewhat implausible."
1	"so, it's not a bad story, but it is obviously free just to try to get you hooked into buying more of the sequels. I didn't enjoy the book enough to succumb, however."
2	'The worst out of all 3 and not in a good way..hated the ending had so many was it could of went that would have been a lot better then this ending'
1	"Trash...don't buy."
3	"This story was HOT! A quick read, Patrick aka Master, was very alluring. As for first time anal sex, he was firm yet gentle. My only issue is that it is so short. While I was able to enjoy the first installment, roughly 30-40 pages, for free, the next two installments, 46 and 36 pages respectively, are $2.99 EACH! That's $6 for 82 pages of literature.... It was a good an intriguing story, but not worth the money they are asking. Which is a shame because I was really feeling Patrick.."
2	"This is a short story not a novel. I hadn't picked up on that when I started the story. I was shocked by how fast it moved.  The storyline has potential but is really underdeveloped and moves too quickly to be believable.  I do believe you can fall in love that quickly. In fact my family had the same reaction to my now husband when I brought him home the first time, and he claims he knew right away.  But in this story Pastor Dan came across pushy and almost desperate. It would have been much more believable to allow the characters to get to know each other and had more of a story line."
2	'Is this interesting.\nNah its common knowledge, you know allready. Or can be searched on the www. So its not worth to read it imho'
1	"I'm a big fan of Zane and although this was not poorly written it was more of a backstory. Just when I started getting into it it was finished. Everyone besides Mom is angry when she comes home but suddenly she talks to Dad and now even the sister who was pissed off is forgiving. It was a good effort but sort of far fetched and not really complete. I'm glad it was free because I'd be highly upset otherwise."
3	"This book is okay; not the best sci-fi I've read, but also not the worst. There are many holes - like humans going from terrestrial to having a lunar base, three space-faring battleships, and crews fully trained in the intricacies of space warfare in just 8 years - that I could overlook (somewhat) to move the narrative forward. The action sequences were interesting and made the book hard to put down, but the story dragged through way too much sex & relationship drama for my tastes... especially for a sci-fi novel!"
2	"Karin Slaughter is my favorite author. I know this was a short story.. but I found it very dry and lacking a climactic moment. I don't think it ties into any of her books like peviously."
2	'Just a very shallow erotic grouping.  Not to good'

1	'Part 1&2 is a consensual heavy bdsm love story. In part 1 Jenny and steve meet and go on vacation and in part 2 Jenny moves in with Steve and becomes his 24/7 slave.

The caracters are not the same as in part 1&2.\nI really liked part 1&2 (4 stars), some of the bdsm elements were not to my taste (to much pain) but since Jenny truely seemed to enjoy them, I didn\'t mind them being a part of the story.\nAs long as the "kink" is consensual I\'m happy but that was not the case in part 3 - hence only one star.\nI wish this story would have been sold without part 3, because that ruined the happy horny feeling part 1&2 gave me.'
2	'Sure it\'s only a few dollars, but damn I hate it when I feel like I just threw the money away.\nOr, as the author would have written it, " I hate it when feeling through money away."\nThe vision of some guy sitting at home laughing at us losers as he counts his money pisses me off.\nSo if grammar is a concept you feel should be part of the writing process, avoid this book at all costs.\n\nNow, on to the review:\nIn the first two hours of the power outage, our gun-toting heroes manage to shoot no less than 3 people.\nWhy?\nFor the evil act of eyeballing our crime-fighters, although I suspect the fact that they were "other than Caucasian" might have had something to do with it.\nThey weren\'t raping an innocent child, or stealing a car.\nThey were just mean looking.\nHey, I\'m all for protecting my family and my supplies, but I think we may be a little too eager to start with the street justice here.\n\nThe story screams of tinfoil-helmet black helicopter conspiracies, and I\'m not even past the second chapter.\n\nI like being a moderate prepper, and I like guns.\nBut this seems to be a teenage fantasy about how cool it would be to be able to walk around with a Glock under your belt and shoot all the kids that picked on you in high school.\n\nThe three folks the story centers on each have a personal arsenal that would run in excess of $15,000, maybe more with all the ammo.

2	'I kept waiting for the stories of anyone in the book to resolve and they never did. It seemed kind of random and pointless with no real, satisfying ending.'

1	'Liked some others got bored to death'
2	'Weak characters and storyline .'
3	'I actually gave this a 3.5-4 stars. It was a fun, fast read. The characters are very quirky and a little over the top. The mystery portion of the story was well done. There were enough red herrings to keep the suspense throughout. I find this a fun series and will read additional books in the Silver Sisters Series.'
2	"I didn't read the description close enough and didn't realize that it was ONLY the study guide.  I guess that is the 11th stupid thing that women do...not taking a really good look at what they are getting."
1	'What can I say?  Governess who seems to have no concept she is an employee (we\'re supposed to feel sorry for her when she can\'t just make a date in the park, while working!).  She talks back to her employer with such "you are abominably RUDE!" which pretty much makes her incredibly un ladylike and frankly, she has the employer whipped.  I can\'t see WHY he might like her, other than she\'s "good looking".  As for why she likes anyone that lets her get away with telling him off over and over (usually slamming a door behind her, that\'s lady like), pinching her charge, telling her boss his cousin is a "scheming hussy"... she behaves at about the same age level as her charge.  When she purposely breaks his rules, with the child in his care, as a parent I was particularly annoyed.  Pretty much the leading lady does whatever she wants, with momentary "oh I wonder if I\'ll be fired" moments.  She\'s so annoying, I keep hoping she DOES get fired and the poor man hires someone with some social graces and that is grateful for the job.  One also gets the feeling she\'s a horrible governess (her transformation of her charge is almost silly).  Annoyance is keeping me from finishing the book,  when you feel sorry for the poor leading man...and only wish the governess would get canned and have to really work for a living and show some humility and thanks for her paycheck... it\'s time to stop reading.  Wasted 99 cents.'

3	"Horrible formatting problems aside, this story was confusing and lacked the draw that usually pulls me into Karen Russell's books.  Trish wasn't enough of a character nor the background rooted enough to allow me to put side reality and enjoy this glimpse into what-could-be.  I love the author's other books and stories and thus the three stars.  If anyone else had written this book, I wouldn't have finished it.\n\nNote: I'll admit that this novella could have been a better read if the book wasn't plagued with formatting issues."
1	'The book was so poorly edited and so poorly proofread that it distracted from the story.  It is extremely irritating to see so many errors on nearly every page of the book. His description of frozen time was so vague as to leave me confused about the process. Needs to hire an editor.'
1	'I did not order it.\n I did not read it.\nI never heard of it!\nHow could I review it?'
3	'I bought this because I saw the author interviewed on tv.  I expected to read more about the quirky folk who live in that building but instead it was almost entirely based on the difficulties in building and selling the building.'
1	'Personally I like a book that is less sexually explicit. Other than that I really liked how the story line was headed and would have looked forward to reading about the future of these people.'
3	"The book isn't long and it's a thriller by definition. However, it starts off slow and doesn't get interesting until the end. By then I was just ready for the book to be over because I'd already figured out the ending. I liked how all the pieces eventually fell together by that's it. There's no real character development, it's repetitive and the ending felt rushed."
1	'Not what I was hoping to read.'
2	'Charles Marohn is a distinguished researcher in the area of urban planning, and writes an excellent blog on the subject. Unfortunately his knowledge and expertise do not shine through on this short publication, which is wordy and offers a train of arguments that is difficult to follow. I hope the author sees fit to compile his extensive experience on the subject matter on a better organized and well edited book.'
3	'Cute. This was was cute. The read was short and sweet.t he book is one of love and full care. Kindness'
2	"I just don't like the side character treated as main character, jumping around so much you lose the immersive experience. This book was Cleve free until the very end, so I went to book 4 and I can tell you it wasn't confusing and I didn't seem to miss any important information."
1	'If I could give it zero stars I would have.  This was pure trash.'
3	'Well written, a unique storyline, with a little romance and sex thrown in.'
3	'UGH, this could of been so much better.  The 1st story was cool the 2nd & 3rd blah blah blah'
3	"After a slow start, the story grabbed my attention.  I can use a computer but that is the extent of my technical ability; so I can't opine on whether the plot is realistic, but it held my interest.  Unfortunately, poor grammar and homonym errors interrupted my reading on nearly every page.  It appears that there was no proofreading or editing of the manuscript.  Quite irritating.  I would recommend this to friends, but with reservations."
3	'Book is based out of UK.  Definitions and basics still can be applied in US....can be good for someone brand new to the industry.'
3	'This was a sweet romance with lots of surprises; however, I did not enjoy this book as much as I could have because of the gross language used by the male characters.'
2	"I was hoping this book will have some specifics on becoming a good small talker. This book has a lot of generalizations and history of why some people are more socially awkward than others.  Most of the suggestions can be summarized as feel more confident, don't underestimate yourself, thinks positive thoughts,  practice on your own. In chapter 5, the author covers how to be a better conversationalist.  It is generic, but had some specific techniques that I thought were useful.  Finally, in the last chapter we get to some specific suggestions on how to start the conversations with strangers.  It is the shortest chapter in the book and I hoped the whole book would be covering the topic in this chapter with more details and more specifics.\n\nIf you feel shy about talking to strangers you are not alone. However, I don't think this book is going to make much difference in getting better at it.\n\nAli Julia review"
3	"Another series targeted to teen girls.  I wish that were plain in the book description.  That said, the premise was one I haven't run across before."
1	"I wasn't able to finish reading this.  It has a decent plotline but the language is contrived and forced and some of what could be interesting twists just turn absurd.  This could be much better with some heavy editing."
3	'Very tasty deserts.  A marvelously smart idea of sweets  for the kid inside of us all..  Wickedly good for the tastebuds.'
3	'The paper would be more useful if it were organized in a more easy-to-follow format.  I find that the news from the day is often from several days ago.  I know I must be screwing up somehow to make this happen, but I am clueless as to how to fix it.'
3	"The first story didn't really appeal to me.  It was just so twisted and forced that I almost missed when or how things took a romantic turn.  The second story was a quick read, literally finished it in 10 minutes but it was extremely well written, thorough and had a great storyline and amAzing love scenes."
3	"The read was good but so short. That's why I gave it only three stars.  If you're looking for something quick to read this is for you."
2	'Good start up book.'
3	'Not as good as I would have hoped. Fast to read and is a scratch on the subject. Okay to start with.'
3	'Easy to read, actually has some surprising and interesting twists and turns. Was a free book so the grammatical errors and errors in names (calling a character by the wrong name) are I guess to be expected.'
2	'First, I kind of liked the story - the plot - a not too likely romance but that\'s ok.  The sex scenes weren\'t bad.\n\nBUT there\'s that old adage: write about what you know.  I\'m not a scholar, by any means, but I do find it very distracting to read all the anachronisms and inaccuracies.  And I understand that most of these books don\'t have an editor, but it would be so nice to have words or phrases used accurately.  I can understand using archaic words to "set the stage" in a historical novel, but then be consistent.  Don\'t throw in a "thou" or two and then revert back to "you"  without even passing by thee or thy.  If the hero is a knight, fine, but don\'t expect a Knight Templar to be getting married to anyone, reputed murderess or not - the Templars were a monastic order, i.e. like nuns or priests - no weddings for them, whatever they might do in their spare sinful time.  I could go on with examples...'
3	'A good quick read..... Marred by poor grammar. Plot was good. Fast paced. A bit of care with grammar and correct word usage would enhance it.'
2	'Entertaining enough but too formulaic for me.'
3	'this would be a good beach read. typical romance book with the same ending as other books. I knew how it was going to end'
3	'This is the third book in the series.  The writing is so so and there are lots of errors.  I kept purchasing the books because I like the story.'
3	"Not my favorite. The beginning was okay, so I thought it might get better. But then, they met each other 3 times in one day and BAM love at first sight. She can't stop thinking about him and vice versa. They were both pining after each other within only a few moments of meeting each other which was really annoying. Also, the characters were who I thought to be underdeveloped throughout the story. Overall, this book just was not for me."
3	'Very interesting and unusual life story of a great Saint.'
1	"To Fast. To soon. There wasn't much to the story for me to even consider it. I know some ladies who loved it but it just wasn't for me. It was a very short porno if I'm being honest."
1	'Never received product'
3	'I enjoyed the older character action greatly.  The ending was too abrupt and I felt let down.  It was hard for me to grasp the final purpose for the plot line.'
2	"Reading the description and reviews, I had great hopes for this book, but it didn't deliver. The characters were boring: Samuel is just a big goon without much to say and Sylvie does nothing but cry through the whole book. Instead of building to a climax, the book just....ends. The girls decide to go to the police, there is a big bloody scene, the police arrive and it ends. And come on, since when does the witness protection program buy you a business to run in your new life? And Samuel just goes home to wait till the mob finds him and mourn for his wife and unborn child who died who knows how long ago? My apologies to the author and I would try another from her--the writing was clear and direct--but this one was a disappointment."
3	"It's OK, but somewhat superficial."
3	"My daughter had it downloaded on her tablet and we are on vacation and I wanted something to read on the beach.  Didn't finish it so downloaded it on my kindle to finish.  It was O.K. but I can see why she enjoyed it.  She is in her twenties, I am not! BUT I did want to know what happened in the end."
3	'Nice enough read, but nowhere near realistic, There are very few bumps for the "heroine", though not 100% smooth sailing. This is a sort of a "wishful thinking dream story" for those who are transgender, the next best thing to being born the other gender. Taking that in to consideration It is a good story for what it is.'
3	'When I first read through this digital book, I thought it had not downloaded correctly on my iPhone, so I looked at it on my computer and it displayed the same way. I believe it displayed as it was meant to and that the pages were not out of order. There are brightly colored pages with cute dinosaurs. For the number 1, there is one dinosaur. For the number 2, there is only one dinosaur on the following page - not two dinosaurs. For the number 3, again one dinosaur not 3 dinosaurs were pictured on the next page.  Numbers 4, 5, 6, and 7 all had one dinosaur,  also; thus there were a total of 7 dinosaurs in the entire book . There is nothing to count on the dinosaur to count up to the number it represented. What gets confusing, is when reading out loud, with the number 4, the written description on the next page with the 4th single dinosaur is "three horned dinosaur." Number 6 has the description of the one pictured dinosaur as "sharp toothed dinosaur," which when read together I would have expected the 6th dinosaur to have 6 sharp teeth -- and the dinosaur only had three. Because the author had the description as this being a picture book for babies, I am giving it 3 stars, but I would not use this book to teach counting.'
3	'Actual Rating: 3.5 stars\n\nThis was a pretty good sports romance. I love when the author throws in some actual on field action instead of just having the character be an athlete, but we never actually see them playing their sport. I really liked Holly and Kepler. Separately they were really interesting and together they were even better. And I liked that Kepler was from South Africa, that added a nice touch to the story. His background was really interesting and I wanted to know more about him.\n\nI really liked that Holly underestimated Kepler. She expected him to be a certain way and he kept blowing those perceptions out of the water. Of course, she continued to let them cloud her judgment. And of course communication would have been the key, but neither spoke their mind like they should have until it was almost too late. I was wrapped up in this story and wish there was just a little bit more to give me a glimpse of the future, but overall it was an enjoyable book. I will definitely keep my eye out for more by Rebecca Crowley.\n\nArc provided by the publisher via Netgalley for an honest review'
2	"I didn't like the way it played on my old Kindle.  I think that it would have been better on a Kindle fire."
3	'Entertaining read. Really needs to be polished.  Many spelling errors.  His knowledge of the aircraft is appreciated.  The B 58 has always been one of my favorite warplanes..'
2	'I read "Barefoot Season" by Susan Mallery and enjoyed it so I thought I\'d read another of her books. Sadly, I chose "The Bakery Sisters". First, I didn\'t realize it was 3 separate stories. Guess I didn\'t read the summary of the book well enough. Anyway, the first story started out ok then went down the Hunk and the damsel road where they are so attracted to each other they can\'t stand it but everything gets in the way of their romance until finally they have a sexual encounter which is perfect and they finally wind up together forever. Then I started the second story about the second sister and it was the same thing all over again. I gave up about a third of the way through and didn\'t even start the last story. I\'m sure it\'s more of the same. I dislike these kind of books and needless to say, disliked this one as well. I don\'t think I\'ll be reading any more of Susan Mallery\'s books.'
2	"To say this book was suppose to drop oct. 15 and to just now drop it should've been way better especially with author going on about she couldn't just give us anything I'm highly disappointed she usually brings her a game but everybody can't be a honor roll student I hope the next book is better"
3	"This book was ok..it started out pretty good, but then it went downhill..I don't like reading books when the girls are so stupid with low self esteem..I felt like the ending was kinda rushed..I will try this author again though."
1	"Grammatical errors, poor writing style and skills -  not even worthy of your time even when it's free"
3	'This is book three in the "A Year Without a Duke" series. This is a different kind of series of books. Yes, it is a historical romance but the underling story to me (I have only read this book, book four \'An Affair in Autumn\' and book five \' A Duke by December\') seems to be what is going on in the people lives on this property while waiting for the Duke to be found. Which isn\'t a bad thing.. just different. I did enjoy this book and the other books...just wanted to make the underlining story clear. Also, with that said this book (and the other I have read) were all stand alone books. You don\'t have to have read the other books to enjoy this one. They are also quick enjoyable reads!\nThis story is about the governess, Adele Vere and the stable master, Edward Coyne. Adele had been orders as the governess to learn to ride and of course Edward would be the one to teach her. Each time she goes for her lesson she is drawn into feeling for Edward that are hard to fight. He does nothing to her in words but when he touches her and his tone she finds herself taken with him. Edward does seem to be slowing trying to seduce her and she finds it is working'
2	"I chose two stars because it had to many stories going at one! She dropped out of school to support her nephew. Doesn't have a doctor degree but gets picked to be a doctor to team! The author h or never describes what her duties are. As a reader I would like some definition with the doctor/nurse, the nephew, his daddy, the school. Story line just never came together for me. Near the end everything was wrapped up real quick. To much angst!"
3	'May have to re-download it, nothing came in but the table of contents.  I rated it 3 to be fair, until I actually get to read it.'
1	"It was like book 1 and 2 were written by different people. There's a huge gap between the books. The main character was ruined."
3	'I really enjoyed the story and most of the art but the way all the women overly-sexualized detracted from the overall comic for me. Still enjoyed the story though, and the way it all came together. I look forward to seeing how the rest goes.'
1	'Seriously, who wrote it? I now have no inclination to really read this book; I skimmed it just to see if they really did give away the ending, and with the exception of details, yep.....'
3	"This was a easy read with a happy ending. The plot felt like it needed more explanation but I don't want to give too much away so, I'll leave it at that. On a positive note I enjoyed the caring side to these hot alpha males."
1	'Will not buy more magazines trough Amazon. I just received a single issue and yesterday they send me a renewal. Of course, I will not renew.'
3	'Will not buy a third one.'
3	'Hard to compare the impact of a book at eight years to sixty plus. On re-reading I thought the first third was still very imaginative but the last half was dominated by troop movements of various kinds, and not so involving. It was a spectacle rather than an envolvment for the characters at that point, Language on the whole a little dated now but still an imaginative yarn.'
3	'Pretty good. Kind of predictable. Easy and enjoyable for someone just reading for leisure. Needs a sequel. Leaves you wondering.'
3	'An interesting take on the subject, but a little hard for the layman to understand formulas. If you are already into this, not bad.'
3	'It was a good book - kept your attention'
2	'This book is somewhat eye opening. and a good book when you need to unwind and build your self up.'
3	'Saw that Ron McGiness was doing the cover.  I love his photos...This book True Father Part two was short... Not sure how to\nrate it..I know when I saw it was a follow up of True Father I did want to read it... Could have been longer?  Enjoyed it though. Steven Law has a great sense of getting into a character and bringing out their passion on paper!'
3	'This story feels like someone took a non-fiction survivalist book and tried to turn it into a fiction book. The frequent forays into "I did this because it is important and my father taught it to me blah blah" feels stiff and was very grating after awhile. If you are super into survivalist information then this book is going to rock your world. If you are looking for a good work of fiction, it sadly will do the opposite.'
3	"This was very much a book of two halves for me. The first half read like another bad PR between a normal human woman and the gorgeous fae jerk because Magical Reasons! Even worse, I didn't even like Alina. Theres just nothing to her. Shes a nineteen-year-old reporter who comes across a fae superstar slumped in a tube station. She helps him and becomes obsessed with getting his story. But she has no family, no friends, no interests outside of getting the story of Sovereign/Reign and bumbles from one bad decision to another.\n\nThere is nothing likable about her. At one point another character describes her as sweet  no evidence of that  and funny  she does have a sarcastic tone which is sometimes humorous  and she has at least two men developing warmer feelings for her. But I don't know why. She is tenacious and determined, definitely, and does show bravery at times, but mostly she acts without thinking and does really stupid things.\n\nHowever, there is actually a reason for all of the above. The only trouble is that by the time it was fully revealed, I simply didn't care and there was nothing the book could do to make me. Same with Sovereign. Hes rude, entitled, arrogant and plain awful from the start. Yes, he shows other sides, and towards the end I maybe felt a little sorry for him, but really, to be honest, I mostly didn't care. Hes a jerk. Hes one at the beginning where he grabs hold of Alina and steals her essence, and he remains one at the end where he throws his concert regardless of lives at risk. Im glad the romance had a doom-ladened quality to it because, hahaha, they deserve it.\n\nSo, safe to say the first half and the romance didn't much work for me. The second half, however, is much more Urban Fantasy in tone and much more interesting to read. Things very much aren't as the first appeared, the fae reveal themselves to be a thoroughly nasty bunch and theres a whole lot of danger arising with plenty of bloodshed and evil behavior. Though I think it was far better than the first half, it still wasn't great. Mostly because I didn't care for any of the characters and I found the lack of reference to centuries' worth of fairy tales and writings of faerie and the like to be a little unbelievable.\n\nWhich pretty much sums up my experience of this novel. I found the characters hard to care about and their decisions and choices frequently flawed. Its a readable enough book, but the romance is flimsy on all sides. I could believe something between Reign and Pretty Fragile Fae girl, but anything between anyone else just lacked any substance. Overall its okay, but it didn't leave me wanting to read any further if this does become a series.\n\n(I received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.)"
3	"I loved the characters.\nBut I read it in an hour.\nBeware, this is not a book, it's a short story.\nI'm glad I paid zilch. Any more and I'd be pissed.\n\nMaybe he'll put out a real book."
3	'Is ok,  Cant do much better for the price, Can be a slow read at some times in the book.'
3	'Best friends who fall in love for the first time.  It was short so only 3 stars...light romance...quick, short read.'
1	'The chapters seem to end and begin randomly. The H and h are not what you would expect. The h is a weak, stupid female who acts like a child! The H acts like a stubborn toddler, who had been told no more cookies. 80% of the story is useless drama that the h causes upon herself. The only good thing is that she tells off her drunk gambler of a father.'
3	'The book is primarily exactly what it says and is the text of the war patrol reports of the Dance along with some supplemental information.  Interesting material and shows the progression from very conservative to more aggressive.  Not a story in the typical sense and not for you if that is what you are looking for.'
2	"Bad science and predictable plot.  I didn't make it past the half-way mark."
1	"Ridiculous and boring. Bad porn plot, male can't tell the difference between two twin sisters and sleeps with both then they're ok sharing. Ridiculous. Shifters with mates who can't tell siblings apart by smell or taste!,"
2	'This installment of the bad boys romance is not nearly as good as the first two i read. Not sure what sort of problem the author has with the ultra hot alpha men in these fantasies going "bareback" , which is what would happen in  real life. Is there such a thing as clean sex?YEHAWAt about 49% of the way through this book, Javier, the hot latin alpha tattooed male  that has been in prison and escapes with just a pair of shorts, suddenly comes up with a "foil packet" out of his pocket when he and Chelsea , sexy beautiful CIA agent suddenly have impromptu sex on the beach.. This whole book is a silly crazy fantastic fantasy that couldn\'t, wouldn\'t happen in real life.  At least the other two books had witty conversation between the two main characters. This book is utterly lacking in that category. Its like the author was just phoning this one in. I think this series has run its course with this stinker'
1	'Unrealistically dirty.  A blow job in a high class restaurant......give me a break.'
1	"I couldn't even finish the book.  I thought I had a high tolerance for bad romance novels but this one unfortunately wins the prize of worst one I've ever read.  Sorry."
2	'If you never read any other books on the topic, this book might help you. If you are a self-help book enthusiast like me, do yourself a favor by saving your time on something less philosophical and Americanized like this one.'
3	'This perspective of this book is interesting, not more that I can really say other than that. I am a reviewer of this product and received free to read.'
2	'Nothing special'
3	"not worth what you have to spend to read it but good book but i\ndon't recomend it till it's free"
1	"This book is about 10 pages long, and has the some content found on a free website. I'd really like to see a comprehensive, problem-oriented guide on labaradoodle maintenance. This is not it."
3	"It's a short story and interesting. I sure did like his novels better."
3	"I had high expectations for this books... I just thought it was going to be so much better:  I felt like it jumped all over the place and quick... What happened to projects murder trial, Haleigh getting a divorce as soon as she cheated but the husband had and outside child and side chick.  I just didn't really like it"
1	'I love EJD. I did not however love this book.  I felt like I was taken on a roller coaster and left suspended in mid air. I guess I just expected more.'
1	'Very\ndisturbing.  I could not finish the book. Why did Amazon offer this book for free?  This book is trash . If I could give 0 stars I would.'
3	"I was afraid of this. After killing off 2 of the 3 main caracters, a little bit of the magic has been lost, as book 11 proofs.\nDon't get me wrong: it's still a great story, expertly told by mr. Brown. It's just that we are arriving at the climax of the story, and a large part of that climax has already past. Kevin's murder was an emotional high-point in the series, so I honestly believe it was a mistake to kill off Kevin in part 10, it was just too soon. As it stands, Brown could not fill the empty space left by Kevin's death, and this latest book in the series feel a lot like an anti-climax...\nDead Part 11 is also the first book in the series  where I was not at the edge of my seat all the time. Thalia's group is now back to being the main story-line (maybe Brown thought that Kevin's story was becoming too important?). It's a little weird, but I just couldn't care that much anymore...\nI really don't know what TW Brown has in mind for the end, but I really hope that for the last episode, TW Browne can once more pull a rabbit out of his hat. But I have to be honest, it will have to be a very large rabbit!"
3	"Very good book. Short and to the point. Recommend to fire fighter wives. That's all I have to say. Good book."
1	'Too painful to read with all the grammar mistakes and poorly structured writing. Felt much like a fifth grade essay.'
2	'I felt like the chanracters were repeating themselves all through the book. I skipped just to see if it would get better. Nope. I love some of her other books but this was missing something.'
3	"First Impression: This being my first E-Book review I was a bit sceptical about the Kindle as I really enjoy an actual book, but I ended up happy on both accounts as I enjoyed reading on the Kindle and this was the perfect book to introduce me to the style of reading.\n\nSummary Of The Book:\n\nThis is a detective novel, the detective in question is Jack Creed. A seasoned cop who heads up the Murder Squad in New South Wales, Australia. Creed has his hands full with an investigation into a possible serial murder case, there are a few similarities to each case but the most recent murder sends the team on a wider search for the killer.\n\nEnter Boston-Wright, she is trying to make a name for herself and avoid letting down her father's awesome reputation. Boston-Wright doesn't know much about murder, but a few days with Creed and she is an expert. This duo along with the help of their team set out on the trail of a killer who has evaded all police efforts so far, but with bodies piling up the picture becomes clearer.\n\nCome and enjoy this dedicated crime thriller, there are twists and turns, gore and mainly a well written plot that takes you around parts of Australia and builds enough suspense and interest to take you all the way to its conclusion.\n\nMy Review:\n\nBreaking Point was new ground for me. An E-Book is not traditionally my preferred format but I ventured into new territory alongside this mini-novel. Breaking Point isn't a game changer, it is a solid but very familiar effort. The plot was well devised, much like an episode of criminal minds or something of that calibre. The characters were stereotypical but I found that along the storyline they followed and their interactions together kept it interesting enough for me to get invested in their presence here.\n\nCreed is a typical hard cop who is fed up of the pain and suffering of the innocent whilst the guilty run free. Creed is split nicely between giving a crap about his team and giving his team plenty of crap. Boston-Wright's role hasn't been done a thousand times like Creed's but it is still familiar, but I feel the time spent with her was one of the more positive aspects of this book. The time we spend inside her head looking at the team and the crime from a fresh perspective adds plenty to the book. Though I really didn't want to know what she was having for breakfast, lunch and dinner, I thought this was rather random and that the author may have wanted to write a cook-book on the side. It did make me hungry quite a bit...\n\nOverall there isn't much new here, I enjoyed the setting of Australia, the team has decent chemistry and the plot was solid enough with a standard but satisfying ending. I will be checking out other Creed material when I get a chance.\n\n6/10\n\nIf you enjoyed this review then please come find more at [...]. Enjoy this book, Enjoy more reviews and Enjoy your day!!!"
3	'Was expecting more from this book. The advice I got were mostly pretty basic. The assessment tools were useful though'
3	'The couple was pushed together by a fairy ghost.  They were sexually attracted to each other but that is all they had in common they did not spend time getting to know each other.  Then the end of the book came and they were madly in love, getting there happily ever after in the end.  I asked myself why, I guess because that is the way the author wrote it.'
2	"This book about the history of Ancient Greece takes about half an hour to read. It covers subjects like: the 'invention' of democracy, famous philosophers and scientists (like Socrates and Archimedes), Sparta and Athens, different kinds of government, Persian and Peloponnesian Wars, the rise and fall of Ancient Greece, and more. This book gives you a overview of the history of Ancient Greece, but it does not give a lot of details. Mayby good to refresh your memory or you could use it as a starting point for further reading about this subject, but this little book is basic and lacks in depth. On top of that: there are mistakes in this book.\n\nAs reviewer W.Dean correctly points out: Socrates was on trial for 'corrupting the youth' and 'impiety', not corruption as we understand it today, as this book seems to suggest by saying: 'Socrates was on trial for 'various offenses, including corruption'.\n\n(Note: this book has the same editor as 'Ancient Greece 101: The TextVook' and may have an identical text.)"
2	"Wow.\n I just reread this after a long time, and I've now realized what a horrible book it is. Please don't buy this book."
2	"It didn't answer any of the questions I had.  This might be good for someone that has never touched a tablet before but if you have any knowledge of them this isn't the book for you."
3	'This series is ok but would have been better as one full length book. A lot of MC action with a bit of a love story between enemy clubs.'
3	'I wish the series were just one book... too short! Otherwise story is good & keeps you reading straight through :)'
3	'The book has a good start...I will read book two but I am sick of the main character using her heart transplant has a handicap preventing her from living life.  I am also sick her her not being able to think on her own without calling her best friend.'
3	"Well written, emotionally moving, suspensful, and heartwarming.  It's interesting to read about Cowboys, telephones, and cars in same story as you get sucked into this tale of danger, love, forgiveness and life changing adventure.  It had good flow and only a few overly wordy parts.  The subject matter was a challenge and though I wouldn't condemn her for her choice of vocation... I wouldn't be over joyed to have her marry MY son."
3	'Not bad,  a little cheesy. Clean Read'
1	'While I agree that motivational books have a place in today\'s reader\'s library, there\'s no need to utilize historical figures\' names in order to "sell\' copies, which is what Sean Patrick did here. This is a disservice to self-help authors, as well as historical authors as well.'
1	"I liked the first book however I didn't continue on to the 2nd and 3rd.\nI do not like multiple partners...for me a big turn off. I can tell you I'm pretty sure it becomes mnage a trios....I'm a one man women.  If you enjoy this read on.\nJust not my cup of tea."

3	'Good concept, characters done well, but the editing was shameful.  The spelling of the most simple words were wrong. Cripple check next time.'
1	"So personally i think the author totally missed the mark on this one.. This book has the potential to be soooo great and instead it just makes you feel guilty... Potentially this book could have been about love and overcoming traumatizing experiences instead it was about crying and wallowing.. The lead female gets raped and no this is not a spoiler as you figure this part out in the prologue.. Then its 5 chapters of the female being somewhat weak and wishy washy and then the rape from her side and comence the crying.. And crying... Oh and some pushing the people who care about her away and the cry some more... and here comes the part where the author made me feel guilty because the lead female got raped and you really have to feel for her because that truly is a horrible thing that nobody should experience except you don't feel for her... Like at all.. In fact i found myself wishing to hit her..hard... It all started when she wouldn't press charges... That is the most selfish descition ever... One thing is if the situation was a he said she said but it wasnt.. In fact there was a witness.. And dna.. And yet she won't do anything because then people would know what happened... So she lets a rapist go loose to that to other women because she doesnt want people to look at her differently.. Only they still do because she changes from the experience... Of course she changes... Now i don't wanna lay blame on her if someone else had been raped because ultimately no one is responsible for other peoples actions buuuuuut she could have made a difference if for no other reason than that the police would know that guy is a rapist...\nNow all of that i could get past if only she tied to get better, to deal with what happened but she doesnt... All she do is cry.. And try to forget.. And hurt everybody else if they try to help... Basically she is horrible.. The only reason i gave this 1 star (beyond the fact that i couldt give it 0) is because of Ryan... He tries.. So hard.. And really he deserves better than to be with someone like her... I know the author made a book from his perspective... If you insist on reading about this read that one instead... Its still written as poorly as this book but at least it has a good lead  Character..."
3	'Okay I guess, for a free language book.'
3	'This is more of a vegan tutorial than a spiralizer tutorial. Instructions are limited, and there are not many recipes. The few there are are good.'
2	'Poorly meditated and written by someone with a dictionary and little knowledge of grammar.  I am glad I got this book at an extreme discount. Otherwise, I would be seeking a refund.'
2	'There was no ending to the book. Very disappointing. The book ended without me knowing what happened. Why did they do this?'
3	'This the sixth book in the series, the author has allowed herself to be influenced by J D Robb & E L James not to her advantage. She should go with her on instincts as she was doing a good job on her own.'
1	"In the digital age anyone can get their book published I guess. I'm going back to reading the classics in print version."
1	'I have never used it.'
2	'Although it does limit the number of appliances needed, this book is pretty out of control in the number of different ingredients that someone needs to buy and store to cook the recipes.'
1	'I do not.buy very many kindle short stories, bought this one on a whim and regret it.  I don\'t want to be cruel but I wouldn\'t give this author a penny for her thoughts if she was thinking of this story.  I believe it was sold under the guise of "Christian fiction" but it does not meet the requirements, as it is not based on ANY Christian foundation, world view,or theology.  It was really just like reading a bad joke with a dumb punchline.  Save your money and spend your dollar on something else - anything\'s better than this!'
1	'I thought it was very good. Erotic and Sensual. The variety of stories was great! All and all I thouroughly enjoyed it'
1	"The 4 and 5-star reviewers certainly didn't read the same book I did.  I don't give up on a book very often, but this one outlived my patience.  I read through about a third of it, enduring the cutesy, chic-lit-like style.  The over abundant narrative drowned out the story line with lengthy and redundant descriptions of people and places that had nothing to do with the story line.  I understood what the main thrust of the book was, but after one-third of the way through, I realized I might not find the real story until near the end.  Boredom set in early and I had to give up."
1	'Downloaded free based on all the "hilarious" reviews. I struggled maybe a 25% through it before deleting... maybe funny to a precocious middleschooler, but the "plot" and writing style are SO juvenile and predictably ironic... except for the vaguely adult content, this belongs in the same genre as \'tween vampire crush/first kiss garbage.\nBTW, I already reviewed (cleanly) this (and rated poorly); it was published and later deleted?'
1	"Not a clean romance.  The book literally had sex within the first two chapters. I didn't make it past that.  It was nothing too crazy, but don't market yourself as clean of your not."
2	'It\'s like a chapter...like that\'s it. It ends and theres no next book or anything. It;s like a super teaser with no explanations or anything. I don\'t recommend it. You\'re left with a sense of..."That\'s it?"'
3	"Not one of Anderson's best, too much ghostwriter.  I did not like the format as it was almost a blow by blow detail of the conversations taking place in a number of his readings, which I found horribly boring and repetitive.  Gave it three stars because I have great respect for Anderson, otherwise I would have rated it a two.\n  The he said, she said format was the crux and padding of the book. The best chapter was a brief synopsis by Anderson in the last chapter regarding what he learned about the other side during his years as a medium.  It was all too brief and covered more in depth and in a more interesting manner in some of his other books.  I didn't think this book was worth the hype or the money, read one of his other works which are much better."
1	"This is a weird book.  I thought this was the Get Things Done book that someone recommended to me but it is not.  It's a very shortened version that states the obvious.  There is a call to action to visit some website at the end of it.  strange."
2	'poorly written'
3	'I purchased the three books in this series together. The first was very good and exciting. The other two had female leads who had air where their brains should be. There are strong females...then there are those whom are just stupid. These were just stupid.'
1	'sucks'
3	'I enjoyed books 1, 2 and the first third of the last book.  After that the plot twists were excessive and somewhat unreasonable.  Nice effort though and they got me through 2 plane flights which would have been really boring otherwise.'
2	'I purchased this book without realizing it was a short short book.  Not only that but the plot was so dumb and stupid.  I disliked the spineless, anemic, ridiculous "Hero" of the book and the "heroine" so unlikeable.  Total waste of money.'
1	'Very mediocre'
1	"I thought this book was about human trafficking and was surprised it read more like porn.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
3	"I enjoyed reading this delightful, colorful book about Pete and his love of sweets. Every chance he got he ate junk instead of real food. But he learns that sometimes the candy isn't as sweet. You'll just have to read to find out more."
3	'It was more of an overview of the  capabilities of us military special forces and the weapons and equipment that are used'
3	'I need more protein in my diet. I am a vegetarian so I decided to drink more smoothies. I like the variety of smoothies this book offers.'
1	'Too many add on purchases'
1	"Just not what I imagined this would cover. Not a great astrology book. Thought it would be, but it just wasn't."
3	'It is free. It is VERY short. If you want to have answers to anything, you have to buy the next installment. Probably a lot more installments. Just when it is getting interesting, you have reached the end. Julian Fellowes has written a carefully researched introduction to a new series. Everything here is accurate: the mannerism of the Duchess of Richmond, the upstart army supplier, the 1868 painting of the eve-of-battle ball, the carefully observed rules of society. It is good, very good. But much too brief to amount to anything but a teaser.'
3	"Although I liked some aspects of this author's style of writing, the story itself is a bit predictable. You know that the main character is in trouble because only an idiot would drive a car to deliver a product for $1000,  at the request of a complete stranger. Author has a down to earth, readable writing style, with good character development."
2	'I couldn\'t wait to buy this because I listen to the Daily Audio Bible regularly and LOVE it. I balked a little at the $20 price tag, but thought, "If I can get a print version of the DAB, it\'ll be worth it." It\'s advertised as having a commentary from Brian Hardin just like on DAB. If you listen to DAB and are considering purchasing this Bible, beware. The "commentary" here in no way compares to what we get on DAB. All it is is a VERY brief introduction to what\'s going to be read for the day. Better to stick with DAB and buy a much cheaper kindle Bible. I love Brian Hardin and DAB, but I expected more from this. May be worth buying at half the price.'
3	"Interesting in parts, tedious in others...couldn't finish it"
3	"Sweet take on the story of Romeo and Juliet set in the current time and the place of Verona in the USA. The Montague's and Capulet's are both candidates for governor when the teens meet at a debate. This is a good book for teenagers and up. I like the ending."
1	"It doesn't sound like it is coming from a man. It sounds like it is coming from a woman and just a repeat of the first book."
1	"I tried to read this book to get information only but I lost interest and deleted it from my kindle. It's so different from Christian principles and couldn't bear to read it."
3	'The story and plots were okay, though predictable. I Would recommend this collection to the very romantic with happy endings'
1	'She just needs to end this series.  To many short books and the story is losing its flare!'
1	'I must have missed the point of this story. It was complete rubbish with no plot. Good job it was short!'
3	'It is supposed to be a novellette but just seems like the book is chopped up chapters of a novel.  Feel left hanging but not with any closure to the story getting ready for the next in a series.  More like you need to turn the page to finish the section.'
3	'The story was just umm. The Hermione was whiney and childish and really started to get on my nerves.  But I enjoyed the writing.'
2	"It was good but a little more detail would've been awesome a b c d e f g h I"
3	'A few good slow cooker recipies I could have found in other books'
1	'They b.e.a.t her.  She allows one of their "pals" to sexually assault her so he doesn\'t rat her and the boyfriend out to her brothers.  She was very nearly raped.  They hospitalize her boyfriend....and we\'re sitting around the Christmas tree together as one big happy family in the end?  Seriously?'
2	"The book was very choppy and not very well written. It had potential but didn't flow well and lacked depth."
3	"I'm not feeling the guy point of view. I am however still looking forward to the next book. I get the holes the guy POV has filled and it more or less just makes me frustrated with the other characters."
3	"I wasn't familiar with the author but it was an east read. A few grammatical errors that stuck out have the potential to bother you. The story line was okay, a bit predictable and the main characters were overly dramatic toward the end. Overall an okay read to pass the time."
1	'Not worth reading for a couple of paragraphs'
2	'I am surprised this book is named Advanced. You can find these Q/A on most free online posts.\nNot worth it.'
1	"The entire story was about a couple grieving for a lost child.  That's valid and a reason to feel sorry for people.  But to write a book about it?  A book with zero plot and the most unlikable characters ever written?  What was the author thinking?"
1	"Used to be great, but now it's horrible.  Up until recently got entire articles now just get headlines of articles. Cancelled"
3	'though the recipes look good there is no recipe for any Starbucks pastries they currnently sell or have sold within the last two years or so'
3	"It's a love story with many layers."
3	"This book was ok...part 1 was amazing..I mean I love it every part..this one I felt was alittle boring at times.. it's didn't have enough drama for me but i love the storyline ... Alexandiar is driving me crazy for one she need to stop being so down and give real man like Vonte a chance... For some reason I don't trust Nick something about him is off.. Brandon needs to man up and stop being so down about life..take responsibility and be there for his child..letti is a sweet girl and that unfair that he is doing that to her. Todi is so stupid instead of stop being a whore she decided to blame all of her fail relationships on alexandria like it's all her fault... can't wait for part 3 just hope it haves more drama.."
3	"This short book was ok. It keeps you entertained and makes for a fast-paced story, the only thing that really bothered me throughout this book is (as of January 2016) the author's incorrect usage of the prepositions then and than.\n\nI hope he has learned how to properly use them by now. If he hasn't I hope he at least hires someone to edit his books because I can't understand how someone who calls himself a writer has this problem.\n\nIf the author doesn't do anything, can't at least Amazon correct the books for him and update them in the Kindle versions?\nIf I see this is a recurring issue in his newer works I will stop reading his books and stories."
3	'This book had a lot of potential and started really good.  Then all of a sudden they were in love and the book ended.  It all went way to fast even for a novella'
3	'Very simple almost predictable love story. Cute quick read .'
3	'Interesting tale somewhat disappointing when some of the main characters are eliminated. But different concept on alien life. I would read a followup story.'
1	"Worthless.  This is a book?  Barely literate.  I think this was someone's freshman comp essay.  And they failed.  Don't bother."
3	"This was definitely a thriller mystery, but it was much more intense then I usually read.  I'm not fond of the language, but realize that is pretty real-to-life, like the story itself.  Having been in a situation where I felt my life threatened before, it brought back too many memories of helplessness.  So...probably will not read the sequel."
2	"The book is lacking is basic substance. The examples are severely limited. there are no good real world examples. There is no glossary. The book is more about the author's ego than about what the author may or may not know. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
2	'This guy is super spammy, as demonstrated by the fact that his site asks "are you sure you want to leave this page?" When you try to close the browser. This book is really short (ex: the hunger games only cost $3 more and is an actual novel, not just a pamphlet that leads you to the links you "have" to see to learn what he\'s talking about.) Waste of money - buy a real book on dating.'
3	'Not sure if this type of reading is my cup of tea (so to speak). The only real problem I had was this book ended so abruptly...and unsure if there is a continuation of the plot.'
2	'This book seemed very young, as if it were intended for teenagers born agaib Christian teenagers.\n\nThe religious comments were jarring and totally the wrong form of religion for British society which was C of E and very high church.'
3	"This isn't a book that will challenge the teej age reader and that's too bad.  It is an entertaining read, especially for those engaged in band activities.  But it's rather underwritten, and is more a fluffy romance than anything else.  It is thoroughly predictable.  It's pleasant enough, but it won't stay with you long.  Just okay in my book"
1	"Silly, unbelievable story line. Stilted dialogue. Amateur feeling. Sorry, I give every writer respect for trying but don't see how this was ever published. Was it even edited? Missing words, stilted phrases. I hope this isn't what I can expect from kindle or amazon. One of my first purchases...very disappointed."
3	"I enjoyed Bill's relationship with his family, his wife and his dog, Franklin.  The story itself was okay.  I am not sure I am interested in reading any more Bi!! Travis Mysteries."
3	'The Crystal Channelers and the Last Reincarnation tells the tail of a group of people tied to crystals and given different powers. When a strange rain destroys life on earth, they try to preserve what is left of humanity as well as unravel the secret of the crystals.\n\nMs Rowland weaves and interesting tale. However it does bog down at times. Still, she does a good job balancing the complex interrelationships she has woven.'
3	'3 star rating was because the story was so short. Good story line. I read the story in about 20 minutes. Age appropriate for all. Never tire of reading animal stories. Especially when the ending is not sad.'
2	"I wanted a plot, and didn't get one....Maybe I expected too much but it was pretty much just sex with some side details thrown in."
3	'There were some grammatical and spelling issues but the story was interesting so I wanted to read more and find out what happened next.'
3	'After reading the first review in which the person feels that this book includes verbiage that is too difficult for children, I downloaded a sample to take a look for myself. I am an Italian-American fluent in Italian from birth, and the language/grammar included in this book is average and normal for a book for children written in Italian. Most classic books for children (in Italian) are written using correct, formal grammar, which is important so that the child learns how to read and speak correctly.\n\nAlthough the language might be more difficult for someone who is not a native speaker, it is an excellent way to become more accustomed to correct grammar. Italian books for adults will contain the same style of language.  For a native speaker, the book is nothing out of the ordinary. I read the excerpts to my 8 year old son, who also is bi-lingual, and he had no problems understanding the language or context of the story.'
3	'Was interesting............'
3	'Great idea, a bit slow moving.'
2	'As a follower rather than a cricket fanatic I found this dull with nothing new.  Almost a book of statictics and not much else.'
2	"A great premise for a book on motorcycling, but the author gets too caught up in technical minutia for the book to hold the reader's interest and attention."
3	"really short essay on Paul Twitchell's plagiarized book, Stranger by the River. sorry but I do not think he HAD these experiences as many have already proven following his history of massive plagiarism. Twitchell's books are OK reading, as they are 'condensed' works of many other authors--some from the 1800s. But I think he got a lot wrong and made a lot up too. This person sounds like a member of Eckankar--the religion that sprang up that Twitchell founded. So since he believes everything he wrote as fact, then his OWN experiences will comply. Spirit/God/Eck/Shab cannot GIVE anyone an experiences outside their own belief framework or they'd not be recognized nor understood. When belief blinders come down--everything changes. This little essay is belief blinders UP. Sorry. Three stars for efffort."
3	"***This ARC was received from Entangled Publishing via Netgalley in exchange for a honest review***\n\nI really like Mia, she is fun and free but still has goals. This story shows that you don't have to be super strict and rigid to accomplish what you want. Michael is her opposite but with a fun, loving guy hidden underneath."
3	'It was actually better than I expected.  The first half was better than the second half.  I am not sure what the purpose of the chapters after the return.'

2	'~ 2.5 Raining In My Heart Stars ~\n\nI don\'t usually read contemporary romance, but I got this free on Amazon.  The cover is HOT and well who can turn down a Cowboy, so I figured I\'d try something new.\n\nI liked parts of the store and other parts I just could not stand. It had a little to much drama and long winded conversations that repeated themselves. To much sexual tension between the main characters and not enough release. Julie just made me frustrated with her feelings running all over the place and her regret. Cade on the other had is a sweet caring cowboy, whom I feel for at the beginning. I enjoyed Caleb the old cowhand the girls "deceased" father hired; thou we all can figure out whom he is right from the start.'
3	'Good recipes...not many graphics...'

3	'a little hard to follow but forth the read.author  interesting writing style, characters fun not a lot of depth, easy read'
3	'"Word Wise" is a clever game that challenges you to join connecting letters to form as many words as possible.  Unfortunately, at least on a Kindle Paperwhite, the game runs at less than an optimal level, with large delays in between choosing letters or navigating through the menus.  Exiting the game often leaves the Kindle lagging as well, and I\'ve had to reboot my Kindle on several occasions after playing.  Ultimately, out of sheer frustration, I had to give up playing this game, and I regret that, because the game itself is so enjoyable to play, but I couldn\'t stand working with an unresponsive Kindle as a result.'

In the original recipe, the ingredients are in the order used as is customary in ALL recipes.\n\nThe imaginary Ms Hewsten and Encore (as in over and over ripping off recipes form the Internet)  try to disguise their theft by mixing up the ingredients which is why NONE of their cookbooks are ever any good.  To this publisher, its just a racket to get your money, nothing more.\n\nKalyn has an affiliate relationship with Amazon.  So Amazon will still make money if you buy her recommendations from her blog and HER recipe.  But the recipe rip-off people wont.  Encore doesnt deserve any of the money  they did none of the real work.  They just cut- and paste off the Internet. Kalyn did it all and shes the one who deserves it.

2	"Promise me darkness the first one was amazing . I laughed I cried . I loved Ryder and Madeline so much . Five starts for both the first two books . This one Though didn't impress me as much . I just did not connect with the characters ."
3	"I churned through the book pretty quick.  It had a good plot, but  I found it a bit predictable, although a worthwhile read.  It could have been spell checked much better than it was, but there were only a handful or two of issues.  It didn't interfere with the book at all.  I would give the author another try for sure.  I only gave the book 3 stars because it has to be one of the best books I've ever read to get five stars.  Four stars to me is outstanding and the book falls a little short for me to rate it accordingly.  Three stars means it's a good read to me."
3	"Confession...I read this right after reading Gabaldon's latest Outlander book. While enjoying the premise of this story, I found the characters underdeveloped and oversexed. It's still a fun read, but pretty light."
2	'The book in and of itself was okay, however it\'s not about what I thought it would be, given the title. I expected a book entitled "Dogs having fun" to be about things dogs do for fun on their own, with other dogs, and with their people. I expected to learn about different activities you can do with your dog for fun, such as frisbee, agility, flyball, and dock diving. It was just some generic informational tidbits about dogs in general. I expected a book with the subtitle "dogs around the world" to be about different cultural aspects of dogs and people around the world (like the Shiba Inu being a national treasure of Japan) or the Hindu\'s festival of thanksgiving for dog\'s loyalty and friendship in Nepal. Fun stuff around the world. Nope. Just things you could find in any "about dogs" book. (Disclaimer/disclosure: I was gifted this product by the distributor/seller for the purpose of review).'

3	"Looking for a dom who has a special interest and talent with ropes? Reed definitely knows how to use them, as well as other toys and props.\n\nThe general idea of this story is 4 friends feel their life is a bit boring and they make a pact to live out their wildest fantasy. Each of them writes down what they want to do and then they draw straws to see who goes first. Marley has to go first, and she wants to be dominated.\n\nThey conveniently found a sex club where she can experiment in a safe environment, and Reed zeroes in on Marley. He wants to be the one to introduce her to the lifestyle.\n\nReed has been burned in the past. His last relationship with a submissive ended up almost two years ago and he hasn't really wanted to be with anyone at that level since. But things change with Marley and he sees the possibility for a future. And that terrifies him.\n\nReed does push the envelope a bit, at least for me, of pleasure and pain, but for the most part he is pretty sexy. His friend Kole on the other hand, scares the hell out of me. LOL\n\nI can't help but make one comparison while reading this book though. This is basically the same premise as a book I enjoyed Wild, Wicked, & Wanton by Jaci Burton, minus the sex club. But I am looking forward to what the other friends will want to be getting into!"
1	"Seriously? You're going to have sex in car oil with a dude you just met, then the next day you're demanding a relationship. This book has no build up and just flashes from point to point and there's irritating grammatical errors throughout. Who thought this book would be worth reading?"
3	"This book was just OK for me.  I have loved some of Kate Harpers other books so was disappointed to find that this one did not live up to my expectations.  I think that the book relied too heavily on the sexual appetite of the viscount.  I also think that it was unrealistic that Meg was so blas about the many encounters that the viscount had.  I realize that there is a reason why the viscount did what he did; however, it just wasn't enough to make me love him as a character."
2	'I can\'t believe I wasted my time slogging through this episode. First part was the subterranean repeat of the prior book. Redundancy after redundancy.

1	'I thought this book was going to be appetizing. But after I read it my hunger faded and it was not very satisfying.'
2	"This is nothing more than a short commercial for the series by these authors.  Pass it up if you don't intend to buy those books."
2	"I never made a connection between the cattleman and the mail order bride. It just didn't grab me at all."
3	"It's a decent book. Clear plot. The MC is developed fairly well. A few errors scattered throughout(ie be instead of by). It's short though. As I'm writing this review there are 10 books that are around 100 pages each and the series total cost is nearly $27. Not worth it. If you are a person who can't stop reading a series regardless of how bad it is, don't bother with this book. $27 for this series is way overpriced."
3	"I think that Steve and Julie's story would have been better as a full novel rather than all these little pieces. The story is sweet, but it lacks adventure, suspense, and excitement. The author has written much better stories with more interesting story lines."
3	"This book had a few funny bits, especially in the second half. The first half Sam and her friends are rather annoying, snobby, prissy etc. I suppose that they are depicted this way so you can see some character growth in Sam. While it would never end up on my favorites list, I didn't dislike this book either."
1	'If you want the information in this book do a Google search for "benefits of rebounding." The book is about 20 pages and most of it is adds for other books. I liked the the sentence or two about 2 minutes of rebounding every waking hour is optimal. This was "new" information but extremely impractical. Who will actually do that? I know its not expensive but it doesn\'t mean its worth buying.'
1	'From the start, the reader is taken on a whirlwind of events, racing from a ball to a house party to being locked in a tomb-like library after Isabel just happens to find one book among thousands that\'s a counterfeit--all in the first 6 chapters!\n\nWith so much going on, I guess we shouldn\'t be surprised that Bennett doesn\'t have the time for proper character development, resulting in painfully one-note characters.  Lucas is full of angst and petulant, Margaret is the loud, nosy friend who leaves even Isabel wondering why they\'re so close, Caroline is flighty and grit-your-teeth immature, and Isabel is so infuriating it makes finishing the book a chore.  Throughout the book--and even in the reviews!--Isabel is praised as a clever, well read bluestocking, but somehow she *always* manages to draw the wrong conclusions and insinuate herself where she\'s clearly not wanted, never learning from her mistakes.  For all her wallflower shyness and hatred of the spotlight, she has no qualms arguing with her husband, Marcus, who she\'s known for about a week, wheedling information from his friends, and repeatedly following Marcus when she obviously shouldn\'t.\n\nI admit, I love a good historical romance novel.  Sadly, this isn\'t one of them.  The characters fall flat, the plot races from drama-filled event to event, never giving the characters or reader a chance to catch their breathe, and the sex scenes leave so much to be desired. From the gratuitous sex scene debated among the other reviews--I\'m with you, Chrystal, there\'s *no way* that would have happened, and there was next to nothing leading up to it--to later on, after they\'re married, and Bennett describes Isabel\'s "pleasure button"--what is she, a steampunk sex machine?\n\nI would have regretted the time I wasted reading this book if is was free, but knowing I paid for it adds insult to injury. Please, take my advice.  Spare yourself this mistake, and find something better worth your while.'
3	"This is quite an original premise, combining Regency romance with magic. The heroine, Sassy, is appealing, smart and clever, and the hero, Justin, is a good looking, Regency stereotype. The context throws light on the lot of less privileged women, and all in all had a great deal of potential. The author even found a way to include graphic sexual content while keeping her heroine a virgin who follow Regency morality: have her dream it! Sadly, I don't particularly enjoy graphic, soft porn. If I like the characters I feel like a voyeur, and if I don't, then I'm not interested. I know many think otherwise, but I note it as many readers like to be informed one way or the other."
3	'Jessica Tandy had just finished dealing with the worst camping trip of her life  with her jerk of a boyfriend. They pulled into a rest stop and that was where she met the sexy and mysterious Flint who is a native. He tells her that he will drive them back to their hotel room since he noticed her boyfriend had been drinking. She gladly accepts and what happen next will make your hear beat and pressure rise...\n\nThe story itself was very good and had a decent flow through. The sexual encounters made me blush like I was a school girl who had stumbled upon her first dirty magazine! Other than the minor grammatical errors, I would recommend this story and think it would be a good addition to your erotica library.'
3	'I really enjoyed the storyline until it became rushed trying to tie up all the loose ends. This is a short story, there is no way that this book is over 300 pages as described. Just beware that the page count should be somewhere around 100 pages or so. That being said the story was good but I really wanted more depth.'
1	"I can't read another word of this garbage. And by read, I mean skim because if I read every word, I might gouge my eyes out. This books... the story seems good at first. The author is very good at drawing you in. But as far as sustenance is concerned, go read any short story at any 8th grade English class ever, and it will be comparable. It's like chapter 3 through the end is just filler, in both the first books, like the author really only planned the beginning, but needed a full book. I'm not even going to waste my time on the third. Maybe I'm jaded because I've found so many wonderful writers over the past two years like Robert Crane. I think if I would have found this book 2 years ago, I might have given it 4 stars, and maybe even finished the series. At this stage in my reading addiction, suffering through these books is like being rich all my life and then having the IRS confiscate all my money. I can't live like that anymore."
2	'How many knife fights do we really need? How many villages do we need to break into? The author has a good concept but the enjoyment of the book is spoiled by the repetitive and unneeded fights and the poor editing.'
3	"Received an ARC copy from author for review.\n\nThis was a great debut novel from Elizabeth. It had the perfect blend of sexiness and romance, but it also deals with grief and heartache and learning how to heal. What I enjoyed about the main character Bailey was that she could stand up for herself and her sharp tongue against certain idiots. Of course I can't forget Bailey's friend Paige, she was funny and sarcastic.\n\nThe twin brothers, Knox and Max were great, and I loved the sibling banter between the two. Not to mention they were both easy on the eyes. Now with the romance, let me say that the chemistry between Knox and Bailey was certainly sizzling, but I loved watching them fall in love. The ending is left off with a cliffhanger and it leaves you with much anticipation for book two."
3	'This book was not just an endless reel of sex. There was plenty of it but there was also an actual story.'
2	"Though I'm not really comfortable giving a bad review I do want to make it clear that I did stop reading half way through the book. I seemed to get more upset as I went so I stopped. I seen a lot of my own mother in Nancy both with her childhood and Illness. I also could relate to the daughters up bringing. What disturbed me was what seemed to be a book (keep in mind only half that I read) about a lady dealing with such a terrible illness seemed more along the lines of a book about the pity of the daughter. The daughter seemed to use her own childhood as an excuse to despise, be inconvenienced, hates this and that (right on down to the poor ladies cat), appalled and the list goes on. I was never close to my mother either and seen very little of her but upon finding her having such difficulties knew to take her to a doctor right away. She could have been a total stranger (and she just about was) and I would have had enough common since to understand there was something going wrong that needed to be addressed immediately. With Ms. Nancy being such a intelligent person as she was just seeing her in that condition would have alerted me to the point that leaving her alone would have scared me. Yes, I too was scared and didn't know what would be next, what I would do, how I would handle it but in these situations you set that aside along with your messed up childhood and you do what you would hope and pray your own children would do for you. I'm sorry to say I seen in these pages a daughter that seemed (I hope later on gained compassion)very self centered and judgmental person. Even going so far as to start the book with a long drawn out church bashing even though it's easy to see your father had problems and apparently the church was a good excuse for his behavior and your mother's childhood seemed to beat this poor lady into submission and it was laid at the church's door step. No, I'm not Mormon. I just could not go on reading. I do hope Ms. Nancy got the care, love and security she so desperately needed in her time of need even though she didn't do a good job with her own children. Not all of us got a good childhood but you go on and become a better person so no matter whats done to you, you can close your eyes at night knowing you did all you could."

1	"If you've ever had the misfortune of stumbling upon her blog, you know that the misspellings and grammatical errors reign in abundance, but they are hardly a distraction from her airhead updates and after reading a few short paragraphs you're left hearing that inherant giggle followed by teehee strumming in your brain that you know she repeats numerous times a day. Just the idea that she authored a book was laughable. At first I was shocked when I saw this, then nervous to even peek inside. Needless say, she didn't disappoint - you can expect constant monologuing about how fantastic her life is and claims that she makes six figures a year by hawking Chinese made junk to unsuspecting fools on facebook. Save yourself the $2.99 - I've touched on the high points (if you can call them that) and hope my review will save someone's brain cells and sanity."

3	'While most of this book was about the life of Nikola Tesla; a large portion of the text was dedicated to the discuss of what makes a genius a genius.  I found it to be interesting with new ideas which is always a point in my reading.  I knew very little about Mr. Tesla and was thrilled to learn just how much he contributed to our lives right now.  Truly, he was a man far ahead of his time.'
3	"A good story but using too many stereotypes.  If you like romance you'll enjoy.  But the divorcee turned off by men is a stereotype.  The experienced woman who takes her is another."
2	"If you are a total beginner at filmmaking this may be worth a read. But it reads very very basic. And once you get to post-production there is little material on especially critical information relating to post-production 'deliverables' (such as a M&E track, etc) for distribution/sales. i think the book should be selling for just a few bucks, if that had been the case I might have kept the book. But I read the book in about an hour and a half and really learned nothing new, so I returned it. Again, if you are a total beginner at filmmaking it might be worth it.  The companion website seemed more like a resume for the author instead of having quickly available resources like script breakdown templates, legal contract templates for talent/crew, location rental, etc."
3	'My kid gave the rating for this book. He enjoyed the book. This book has a great moral story for the kids.'
3	"I wish the whole book was free, that's why I really don't like it, otherwise ,great book :) :) :)"
2	"A big majority of the book was unrealistic and overdramatic. Many of the characters' actions and the way they spoke felt unrealistic as well. Also, it was hard to feel the connection between the two main characters. I didn't feel their chemistry at all.\nThe conclusion of the book was extremely obvious and somewhat clich. The entire story in general all seemed very... done before. It lacked originality. I didn't give it two stars because it was a terrible book but simply because it lacked original, convincing, compelling, and realistic content. There was nothing out of the ordinary or special about this book."
2	'I am definitely in the minority here.  I didn\'t care for this one. SPOILER--- First, the heroine was a _itch in my opinion.  she is in a parking garage, everyone I have ever been in regardless of time of day, they are darker than the outside!  she steps from the back of a vehicle into the roadway and she gets all bent out of shape when she is almost hit.  In that situation, I would think the rational person would pay more attention to her surroundings and be sure the coast was clear --of vehicles and unsavory characte4rs!\n\nNow the "jerk" that was driving the BMW is just that, a jerk.  One because he almost hit her and two because he was driving an expensive car.  For the rest of the story, that I read, she refers to him as a jerk and a few other choice names.  She took no responsibility for her part in the near accident.  So she gets into the building and they wind up on the elevator together.  he doesn\'t know her from Adam and she seems to be all bent out of shape because he didn\'t recognize her as the almost hit victim.  Then she proceeds to dress him down because he apparently has money and we of the poor always hate those that have!!!  Personally, she got on my last nerve.  I thought all her actions were those of an absolute  _itch.  Now, I realize he was turned-on by her snarky attitude, etc. but at this point I am thinking that just about anything female would turn this guy on.\n\nI didn\'t feel a lot of love for either of these characters.  Liked him better than her though.  So, I quit reading.  The elevator ride was really getting on my last nerve.  You really want to piss off someone that you are stuck on an elevator with and you have no idea how long you will be there?  Doesn\'t make sense.  Of course with this self-righteous __itch you really would just love spending more time with her.  I just did not like her at all.\n\nThe story was not for me but doesn\'t mean you want enjoy it.  So you read and decide.  I believe it is short so not a lot of time would be wasted if you don\'t care for it.\n\nI was not paid for this review.  I am not an author nor do I know one.  I am a reader and this is just my opinion, nothing more, nothing less.'
2	'Though the author hints the book should help also those who have just 2 days for Vegas it must be more handful for at least one-week visitors. It contains a lot of detailed informations on restaurants, shows and hotels, etc. and you need at least two-day study to make choices. Studying the book before you go is pointless - one needs to have basic orientation in topography and specifics of the site to understand the directions offered by the book fully and design a good plan. To give a contrary, more effective approach: a part of my program was birding around Vegas. I found an amateur website structured like: "if you have 2 hours, visit Sunset Park", "If you have 4 hours, visit Henderson Preserve", "If you have a day, go to Corn Creek...", etc. - I really missed this simplifying approach in the travel guide.'
3	"It's okay. It's cute enough but wish it had a little more too it. My husband likes it and we are both Fallon fans but expected more."
3	"The writing pulls you in from page one and holds you there.  How ever I really wouldn't classify this as a romance since its mostly one sided. More of a very strong friendship between two very amazing men. The straight one (because straight is the only way to describe him ) though loves his friend dearly is not in love with him . No physical desire is portraited on his behalf towards his friend through whole of the story. It  seems as if he's become so accustomed to having him around he can't see himself without him, so it had a content ending rather than a happy one. The friend that is  in love was just happy to still be accepted and to be allowed to share his object of desire's life never really got his very deserved happy ending. Then there is also the complete lack of intimacy  for those couple of kisses given were awkward and not all lucid. Its not really the lack of sex as another reviewer implies but more of a lack of desire from one of them completely.  Every healthy relationship includes sex and I don't have to read the details but just the implication of it's occurrence or at the very least an expressed desire for it from both parties would've sufficed."

1	'Links take you the verse but there is no link to take you back to the topic list. Study bibles also give more information on the verses but this has none and therefore the words study bible should be changed to bible only with topical index.'
2	"Though the writing was good, this story just wasn't for me.  The couple was actually a train wreck.  I checked out on the female the first couple of pages.  The male not much better.  The six months or whatever they were apart just sealed the certainty for me that I didn't care one way or the other whether they got together or not.  Writers really need to start writing about characters who handle grief graciously and not like they need to be committed.  I cannot connect with characters anymore who take behavior to such extremes over the loss of someone.  If I cannot connect with a character and the writer cannot justify the behavior, other than my husband died therefore I will become a closed off cold bitch, then I won't root comer the HEA.  She was one of the coldest characters characters I've read about, and I never understood why.  The way she initially behaved  I thought maybe shave had been attacked, beat, raped....but it was just her husband dieting, and though that is tragic, her behavior was so off that I thought she needed in patient counseling for bipolar disorder.  Just really weak."

She tells him her secrets, believing she is about to die. The girl is in love with this boy's friend, who has a girlfriend. At the end of the vacation, she returns home to find that the boy with her secrets is coming to live with them. He wants to study abroad. You can tell where it goes from there.

1	'I was really excited to get this book. I\'m almost in my second trimester and any technical "stuff" about pregnancy I\'ve been reading online. So, I wanted a witty book that told me the inside scoop. This was a weird book that really turned me off reading the rest. Seriously! I got to the Second Trimester section and put it down and haven\'t opened it since. I\'m ready to see if my local book buyer will take it off my hands. First, it seems like the author printed it from her garage. Second, if you are not experiencing what her and her friends(which you get really tired of hearing about) are experiencing, then you just aren\'t normal. For example, I\'m not nauseous and I have regular bowel movements. According to her, I\'m an alien. I feel like if I ever met her and told her those two facts she would kick me because, god forbid, I\'m not puking every second of every day. Geesh! Third, her stories about her and her friends are annoying and seem really exaggerated. Fourth, she uses the made up word "dadgum" in every other paragraph and that also becomes annoying. Just say "damn!" The only thing I learned was how to buy a bra while pregnant. Thanks for nothing! Don\'t buy this book!'

I read this as it was on my book club list and it was not enjoyed by any of the other book clubbers either (10 of us in the club).  Other reviewers I know have given The Memory Artist good reviews, but unfortunately I can't recall any part of this book which would alter my opinion."

1	'I very much enjoy Amish romance books.  However, I do have to say that this was perhaps the worst Amish romance book I have ever read (it\'s a compilation of stores, none of them tying into the other, so it\'s not a series).  The first story in the book was hard to follow.  The author goes overboard on adjectives (if she is actually Amish with only the 8th grade education that is enforced without being shunned this might explain quite a bit in the way it was written, however, since she is a published author I doubt she is still Amish).  The number of times that I read "baby blue" as to a reference to eyes, sky, shirts, etc. was ridiculous.  The grammatical errors were very numerous.  The word substitution (actually probably misspellings that were never caught) were quite funny - example being: "a live man put his shirt on his [something overly descriptive] statute" instead of his "[something overly descriptive} stature" (please note that is a direct quite from the book, but just something that remained stuck in my mind).  The statute/stature substitutions were present a few times.  The books are so poorly edited that I actually gave up reading the book.  I had purchased the Whoopie Pie Bakers series and found errors in them.  Had I not ordered them all at the same time I would definitely not have ordered after I read the first.'

And of course there's a prophecy about her and some mystery about her parentage.  If you haven't read a lot of these, and/or you're younger, you may enjoy it thoroughly.  If you're 40..."

2	"First third of the book was pretty good, but after that I felt it really went downhill.  It was like the Publisher approved the first third, but didn't read the rest.  The story got REALLY boring - the inane dialogue and descriptions - like the author was trying to fill up space (if someone mentioned making hot chocolate for someone again I was going to scream!!).  I didn't feel a strong connection between the two main characters - I didn't get a sense of their relationship developing well - in fact it seems there were a bunch of missed opportunities of when they were together that the author just skipped. There were an increasing number of conversations and situations that just didn't ring true for me.  I got about half way and just gave up."

2	'This one was really disappointed. I enjoyed the story and concept, and it was much better written than a lot of amateur LGBT fiction I\'ve read, but there were a few things that made it almost unbearable to keep reading in certain places. First of all, there were far too many spelling, grammatical and punctuation mistakes. If you\'re going to spend the time to write a novel and actually publish it, you should get someone to proofread it. Secondly, I couldn\'t tell if this was supposed to take place in Great Britain, Australia, the U.S. or somewhere else. There were a lot of "British-isms," particularly in the dialogue, but then other areas where the author clearly tried to use "American-isms" (such as referring to "soccer" instead of "football" or "footy," the grade system in school, etc.) Those discrepancies were very distracting. Finally, some of the plot points were far too cliche, particularly the "ultra-religious" parents, the "straight friend" at school who, practically without warning, basically jumped the narrator the first time they hung out socially, etc. Like I said, I\'d really like to recommend this one, because there were parts that I really enjoyed, but with the abundance of issues I already briefly outlined, I just can\'t encourage anyone else to read it.'

2	'My first experience with Christianna Brand\'s work was years ago when I read and greatly enjoyed her justifiably classic GREEN FOR DANGER, the movie version of which is also excellent. When I discovered that DEATH OF JEZEBEL involved a seemingly impossible locked-room murder, my favorite kind of traditional whodunit/howdunit, it became a "must-read."\n\nUnfortunately, it turned out to be a "bust-read." It\'s a ploddingly slow-paced novel populated with weakly developed characters diluted via the author\'s omniscient viewpoint and confusing plot situations, not the least of which of the latter is the explanation for the "impossible" murder. I can\'t go into greater detail without introducing a spoiler, other than to caution that unless you\'re a completist or hardcore fan of the author\'s, you\'ll want to bypass this particular novel. Despite the author\'s deserved reputation for GREEN FOR DANGER, this is not one of the great mysteries of the 20th Century, let alone of all time.'
1	"I HAAAAAAAAAATED THIS STORY. I AM HEARTBROKEN. SCREW JAKE AMY AND IAN WAS WHAT I WANTED ALL ALONG *sob sob* It was so perfect. And so awful. I hate it!! just rip out my heart and spit on the pieces! Jesus!\n\n5 SEC LATER\nOk, so I was so upset I didn't even bother to finish it. Well, I just did. Guess what? I am actually spitting in fury. HOW DARE THOSE 39 CLUES PPLE DO THIS TO ME-HOW DARE THEY-"
2	"The late Jaime Correso's study of the life of Pedro lvares Cabral is now a classic in the Portuguse historiography. I first read this book when I was in high school. This book is supposed to be a copy of the first edition. The problem is that the text is often truncated and the OCR conversion is so bad that unless you have a an excellent vocabulary you can't really makeup what the author intended to write. This book is being offered for 99 cents. It is not worth a dime. If your are really interested in Corteso's superb work, spend a little more and buy a volume which does not exploit his master's genial writing style and rigurous research in such bed taste as it is done in this edition."
1	'Very little description and imagination. Difficult to visualize this story. I could not make it through and began reading the first few words of each paragraph until I ended it prematurely.'
2	'It started off good but then it took the unbelievable train left. There\'s not much I can say without spoilers so be forewarned. ***Possible Spoilers*** He\'s tired of having so much sex in Chicago? His parents are upset about this behavior and he confessed it to them? I didn\'t buy this. Even if he was ready to settle down more did he need to treat his past like its criminal? Do guys actually think this way? I\'m dubious. Also the whole reason he stopped talking her towards the end of the book is ridiculous. It takes his parents to say something to him and hello he still does nothing to pick her over the sister or just show common decency. Seriously if he feels he has to let her go because he might fall back into his pandering life style then he\'s not ready for a serious relationship. The biggest problem in this book is that his "relations" with her seem like a chore to him.'
2	'Using the Kindle to read a newspaper was just too difficult. Books are much easier as they flow page after page without a lot of searching.'
1	'Not good at all how do I cancel?'
2	"Lengthy anecdotes which failed to reach the point quickly hurt this book the most. Dragged on. Couldn't even finish it."
2	'I realize this was a short story leading up to the first book of a series, but I did not enjoy it. I had no idea what was going on, and the entire thing is about a man looking for a dog. Blah. Perhaps the series is better, but this certainly did not make me want to read it.'
1	'Too short to be called a book. I finished in less than 10 minutes. Honesty it was confusing too. It jumped from here to there with no true ending.'
1	'You can download this free on the internet. Same for Libreoffice which works better'
1	'Could not get into this book'
1	'I have not read it... will do it soon. At first and quick glance, seems interesting.\nhope tofind in it useful infos.'
2	'No pictures! Very brief introduction. I would recommend a more in depth guide if one is truly interested in edible wild plants.'
1	'If you have read even the most basic of books about WWI, then don\'t waste your time or money on this book.  It is only 92 pages long, of which the first 47 are a general description of the beginning of the war.  Pages 48 through 74 concern the actual battle for the forts of Liege.  The book is repetitively vague and there is not a single map of the forts surrounding Liege. (But there is a map of Europe in case you don\'t know where that is.)  It was possibly written for middle school children.  And the "customer reviews"??  I can only assume that they were written by the author and his friends and family.  I mean really...100% 5 Star reviews?!\n  It will be interesting to see if this review is even posted.'
1	"A confusing and difficult book.  I didn't make it halfway through"
1	"Even at $.99 this book is a loser. The plot fails to deliver any real excitement. The dialog - who talks like that? It's stilted and flat. There's unnecessary detail about clothing and other useless trivia. As the other reviewer said, it's like a book written by a teenager. Badly.  I would give it no stars but Amazon won't let me."
2	'Please Note:  I received an ARC copy of this book from Edelweiss in exchange for an honest review.  This did not influence the content of my review in any way.\n\nI\'m not fond of writing negative reviews.  Usually they are needlessly snarky and mean.  But I do feel a responsibility to steer people away from book that I think are problematic.  And so, with this in mind, I am going to expound upon why this book didn\'t work for me.\n\nWhat I Didn\'t Like:\n\nSituation:\n\nUnder the heading, "It could only happen in a novel" comes the idea that a person\'s blog is an instant hit (and a money-maker, to boot)!  NO WAY.  Having a hit blog is an essential part of this story, but I must say from my own experience, it takes a tremendous amount of dedication to create a popular blog.  And, even with such popularity, it is very difficult to make money from blogging.  As a blogger, I found this foundation to be insulting.\n\nCliched Tropes:\n\nOne of the most often used story lines in YA is the best friends who are meant for each other, if only they would give it a go.  I am not one for spoilers, but I will say that the guy, Drew, does something in this book that I consider unforgivable.  I just didn\'t see how Renley could get past it.\n\nCyber Disaster:\n\nI have seen, first hand, the devastating effects of social media turning on young girls.  It is a life-altering event that has long-term consequences.  I think the author does a disservice to teens by downplaying what happens to Renley.  I know teens who have been threatened and had to switch schools after having issues with social media.  In this book, there are a few problems for Renley, but they seem to be easily blown over after just a few weeks.  Not realistic.\n\nWhat I Did Like:\n\nTheme:\n\nI think the theme of the book, being true to yourself and not being seduced by popularity, is a worthy subject matter.  I just think that the situations and consequences were completely unrealistic.  I wish that it would have been less contrived, and more thoughtful in its delivery.'
2	"This is good for a short read.  Not much depth to either character.  I don't think it was worth the 99 cents I paid.  If it was free, it would be worth reading."
2	'This package has a nice selection of games, but on the Kindle Paperwhite, it runs way too slow. Also, when your cards are arranged so that you have already essentially won, there is no auto-complete, so you have to painstakingly move every single card indiviually.'
1	'I loved the begining... however the whole thing was too short... i was left completely frustrated.. I wish I Never brought this book or stumbled upon it...'
2	'Approximate Lexile: 730\n\nI really wanted to like this book, but the author made it very difficult. Looking at the high ratings on Goodreads, Amazon, etc., I frequently wondered if I was reading the same book. The writing is often stilted, with an emphasis on telling rather than showing, and the author lacks a fundamental understanding of how to use commas. I wondered how it got past an editor in its comma-less condition. After a little research, it appears that this book and its sequels are self-published. Any author who self-publishes should invest in a GOOD editor, not just one who got an A in English that one time.\n\nSo many things that bothered me the neighbors name appears to be Old Farmer Johnson. Likewise, Airman Buzz. Is Buzz his last name? How trite can we be? And does the author really think an airman whose job is to monitor the skies for incoming threats would be playing games on his smart phone while on duty? That seems to me like a one-way ticket to court martial.\n\nAoleon is the only real female character in the book, and she comes off as a little bit irresponsible.\n\nThe book says its aimed at middle grades; the simple language and straightforward plot make it more suited to grades 2-4. Then the author throws in a lot of science-speak that brings it back up to middle gradesor even high school. I get the impression that maybe he doesnt hang out with many kids, so hes not sure how they talk or think.\n\nThe illustrations are prettyespecially the ones of the planets as Aoleon is inbound toward earth.\n\nIts sadthis book had potential, but it remains untapped.\n\nWho would like this book: Kids grades 2-5 who like stories about space.\n\nPossible objectionable material: Sneaking out a night. General mischief.\n\n(I received an advance reader copy from NetGalley in exchange for a review. As you can see, its an honest review!)'
1	"I thought it was the second book--so that was the first disappointment, then it was more like a pamphlet.  With that said it was nice to get hana's point of view--"
1	'This was so poorly written that I quit reading it after the first 40 pages!! The plot was pure saccharine, the dialogue ridiculous.'
2	'I really expected (and wanted) to like this book.  I was patient and kept reading, hoping to get to the part of the book where it took off and became interesting.  But I honestly never ended up connecting with or caring that much about the characters.  For me, this book was a disappointment.'
2	"Simply put, this book is a very early draft and is not ready for sale.  Bleeding Edge Press has only published two books to date and apparently  believes that publishing an e-book only technical book allows them to forgo quality editorial review.  Many other early drafts of books used to crowd source editor and technical review exceed the quality of this version.  The book is full of gramatical and technical errors.  More importantly, the author's laying out of AngularJS is disorganized, lacks structure  and is often out of context.\n\nThis is a first book for the author and its a solo effort.  While the author has contributed to a few AngularJS peripheral projects, he does not appear to have the breadth and depth of knowledge or experience with AngularJS to write this book without close editorial oversight.  The BackboneJS book just published by Bleeding Edge has five authors and a couple of them have long histories with Backbone and/or have published before.  That depth of knowledge and experience is simply not present in this book and it shows.\n\nThis said, if you are new to AngularJS, this book is not the place to begin.  It will quickly discourage you (AngularJS is not as disorganized as this book makes it seem).  I understand that there is a void when it comes to AngularJS books - but unfortunately the publisher has rushed to fill that void and severely compromised this book in the process.  Adding insult to injury, the publisher sells this same book elsewhere (google the title) at a discount.  Not cool and not a great way to establish trust with your audience.\n\nReal shame - it had promise."
1	'Book is poorly written, pictures do not correlate with any of the recipes, you think something looks good, and then read on that the picture has nothing to do with what they tell you to make...'
2	"I could not finish this book.  I read quite a bit, but it just trudged on and on and didn't seem to be going anywhere.  There was nothing compelling about it to keep me going.  Maybe it is better further on, but I could not get there.  Maybe it would make a good abridged/condensed book."
2	"What started out as a good plot became a story wrought with inconsistent character behaviors, poor grammar and spelling, and a lame heroine whose ridiculous desire to withhold information made the entire story unbelievable.  I made myself finish reading the book, but it was such a disappointment.  Considering this was Ms. Ross's first novel, the editor should take responsibility for the poor way this book was released.  I hope these comments help improve future writings."
1	"I bought the kindle book because the synopsis of the story sounded interesting. Unfortunately the book was a disappointment. It was like reading a fifth grade story. I tried to give it the benefits of the doubt but I had to quit reading it after chapter 5. Overall poorly written. Story line didn't flow/didn't make sense. The characters were 2 dimensions. Not a good read."
2	'It was ok. Quick read, but lacking in spark and character development. Not a waste of time if looking for something light.'
1	'Too restrictive in game rules. Forced to make moves,no choice. Removes strategy and options.  Would not buy this game again'
2	"First, let me start off by saying that I really wanted to like this book. But I found Ingrid extremely annoying, judgmental and contradictory... All the things she despised while running off to support her then boyfriend, Jayson/Jay Slade as he navigated his way through the entertainment business as a brand new artist.\n\nJayson was a bit more likeable, but he didn't come across as firm with Ingrid. He let her get away with some things that should have not been acceptable. Quite frankly, it left me thinking if he was indeed ready for a family and marriage, because his actions stated otherwise.\n\nIt had potential, but the repetitiveness and immaturity of the characters lost me."
2	"I didn't see what others' did in this book. It was not what I would consider a western historical romance as a couple others have called it. Yes, it happened in the Old West, but the bulk of the story was about the H and h having sex. Couldn't-keep-their-hands-off-each other detailed sex from about one third of the story on. Or else the H was thinking about having sex with her. I didn't see the need for using the f word.\n\nIt was a different story with the traveling 'freak' show. The author was able to allow the reader to see the other people in the troupe as people first and not their differences. There were quite a few words missing and misspellings. A quick proof read would have fixed them. My copy happened to be one with the guy and his scraggly back. What a turn off! The new guy and his tattoo is much more fitting for the story. I wouldn't put it high on the list of recommended reads."
1	'this game stinks i spent my 1.99 and then when i tried to play it a note popped up saying it is not compatible with my kindle. do not take the chance'
2	"Wasn't impressed. I was disappointed with this story. Kept thinking it was going to get better; however, it just dragged on without substance."
2	'It\'s been a long time since I read this series and all I can say was that I didn\'t like it. I\'ve let the feelings simmer over a while, so maybe as I looked back on it my feelings might be different, but they aren\'t. The first book wasn\'t that bad. I got it for free so I figured, why not? I hated the most that all of them ended in cliff hangers. Even if I wasn\'t super interested in the characters, I still wanted to know how the story ended (I\'m weird like that and it\'s the thing I hate the most about me). I never felt like these characters had any chemistry and their relationship was forced by the author. And because it claims that "Fans of 50 Shades of Grey will love it," I felt like the male protagonist was forced to have some Christian Grey traits. He actually seemed like he would be more of a sweet and sensitive guy if the author wasn\'t so intent on making him dark on brooding. The characters and their relationship is the worst part of the book, which is actually the whole book. I wouldn\'t recommend it, especially since you get no answers in the end.'
2	"a full-on assault to the senses, is right.  Brutal ruthless psychopath killers who fed on the American Civil War, their story of butchery and torture stretching from 1864 to 1900 spreading carnage from Georgia to Chicago, Arizona, California, Canada and Oklahoma.\n\nA 5 star look at man at it's worst made too explicit and vivid for this reader who doesn't need the horror so lovingly depicted."
1	"I love to read. I'll read literally anything - just the act of it soothes me, and I've been known to read utter crap because I can't *not* finish a book once I've started. This series was the exception.\n\nPlease don't waste your hard-earned dollars. Besides having no build-up, the protagonist's best friend (and a central character) was a totally self-involved, unlikeably vapid drunk. The protagonist herself was a total dishrag with no redeeming qualities, and the love interest was interesting only because you're told he's interesting. It's not great writing (which excuses a weak story line), and the conflict isn't even interesting. Seriously, pass this one up."
2	"First off, the writing is a little old for a children's picture book.  It's not bad, per se, just over the heads of the age group I would think is being targeted, based on the illustrations....which are very cute, by the way.\n\nThe storyline is my main concern.  Basically the fox gets away with lying, stealing, and cheating the coyote out of his food.  Now, if the fox met with some sort of retribution, or was in some way portrayed as being bad (rather than clever), my opinion would be different.  But he's not.  He's portrayed as being the smart one because he lies and deceives...even in the book's blurb...and the coyote is portrayed as stupid, and mocked because he believes the fox.\n\nThis is not something I would want my children to learn, and rather than having to editorialize while reading this to my kids, I would have them read something that has a better moral to the story.\n\nSorry, but I'd not recommend this."
1	'What kind of question is "How many cats are eaten in china every year?"? I don\'t think is a good question for a cat lover or a kid...'
2	"Definitely not what you expect after reading the summary.  I don't know I just think its missing something.  Didn't really care for it.  I thought it would be good and its kind of expensive for 29 pages for 3 bucks.  I was disappointed."
2	'I enjoyed what I read, so far. But imagine my shock when I turned the page expecting to find the next chapter, only to see the words "THE END" instead. I absolutely positive hate the games some authors are using to get you to buy their books. I will never EVER knowing play these games. In fact it\'s the complete opposite for me. I have a list of authors to never read again, and guess what? You, Ms. LuAnn McLane just joined that list!!!!'
2	'IT WAS CUTE  BUT  WAY TO SHORT OF A BOOK.  IT IS REALLY A SHORT STORY.  THE AUTHORS BOOK  A FORMILIAR  SHORE  WAS A  GREAT BOOK ~~'
1	'Seemed like the book was not finished.'
1	"There are some very whacky ideas in this book.\n\n1.) Outsourcing is good for America. Reason? Because some of the most successful companies in America are getting their goods and services from China. These companies are really successful (!!) so outsourcing is good!! See, just look at Detroit today. Lots of poverty! They are not outsourcing to China. Hence, outsourcing MUST be good for America.\n\n2.) Climate change is a myth. Reason? The left-wing elite buy homes on the beach, and aren't worried about sea level rise. Clearly, the elite left would never buy a home on the beach if they thought global warming was real. Hence, it MUST be a hoax.\n\nNeed I say more?"
2	'Love Bill Rogers but this book i found boring and not up to his usual standard. I have enjoyed all of his books to date , they are always in a different setting and this makes for interesting reading.'
2	'This is not the fault of this item; I just lack the fluency in French to decipher this book. It is my fault for not reading the fine print of the listing on Kindle. What is frustrating is that there is no equivalent offering in English.'
2	"Didn't finish it.  Could not get interested in first 100 pages."
1	'Could not stay interested'
2	'I did get a few interesting tidbits, but mostly a transcript from an interview that does not adequately address the necessities for venturing into short sales.'
1	"I enjoyed most of this book - but it contained foul/filthy language. Quite a few times I started to delete the book and not finish reading it. The author had a good storyline, why he had to include the language that he did is beyond me. The filthy language might not bother some people, but I don't care for it. I really don't understand why I finished the book."
1	"There is no end. Difficult to figure out who the characters are.what's the point. Is this supposed to lead right into another book?"
1	"I'll be straightforward and say what I think about this book: I hated, please forgive me but it was awful. I'm getting sick of the same plot, and this reminded me so badly of those hateful latinamerican soap opera, for real! And I'm Hispanic so I know what I'm talking.\nPlease, just please, give those poor girls more self esteem and love for themselves, I can't tolerate to read about a girl like that anymore.\nLess than 60% and I almost stopped reading it, but I'll be sure not to read at all another of these authors with this kind of plot."
2	'not worth a penny'
2	'I had recently read The Shack and on the basis of recommendations I chose He Loves Me.  This book has a certain appeal but the emotional impact is not present as I felt with the Shack. He Loves Me professes a philosophy so present in churches that " I know the way..."  I am starved for information re. my spiritual path and will continue to search for that that fits me.'
2	'This story takes some dark turns. The misogyny, incestuous activities, as well as child rape leave the reader, me, depressed. Hated it.'
1	'This is a lousy book written by a guy who comes off as a truly horrible person.  Honestly, I\'ve never read anything so crude and crass in my life.  (He actually makes a comment about his wife spending time at a "gash" store.)  What was the editor of this piece of trash thinking?\n\nThe content of the book is very disturbing.  Here\'s a guy with more dollars then sense who buys cars, often ruins them with "upgrades" and then resells them.\n\nI really disliked this book so much that I deleted it off my Kindle as I don\'t even want to be reminded that I wasted my money on it.'
2	'I didn\'t expect to write a review of this book.  I read a lot of books, way too many to do reviews for all of them, so I generally only write reviews if they were exceptionally good or really bad.  I don\'t want to take the time to review an average book.  And this one should have been average.  It reminded me of an 80\'s Harlequin, with Yanis, rich and powerful, dominating Lee throughout most of the book.  I was ok with that because I was in the mood for a "mean" hero and I thought the storyline flowed pretty well.  I noticed in reviews of her other books that people complained about grammatical errors.  There were plenty of those, but if the story is good enough I don\'t mind overlooking them.\n\nWhat I couldn\'t overlook was the overuse of the word "had".  By the middle of the book it was to the point that I couldn\'t even concentrate on the story because "had" kept jumping out at me.  Sometimes several in one sentence.  Out of curiosity I counted them once and there were 16 just on one page.  So I basically just skimmed the last half of the book because it was too painful plowing through the "hads".  But the story itself was good enough that I wanted to see how it ended.\n\nIf not for all of the "hads" throughout the book I would have given it 3 stars.  It\'s a nice average story.  I got Kidnapped the Wrong Sister by this author because it was free and I\'m sure I\'ll read it, but I noticed one of the reviews for that book also mentioned that had was overused, so it\'s obviously a trend.  That\'s too bad because her books have a lot of potential.  I don\'t think I will pay for any more of her books though.'
2	"This book has the MOST IMMATURE heroine I've encountered in a long time.  Three fourths of the book  is dedicated to her insecurities and inability to communicate with her husband while he continuously begs.  The other fourth is dedicated to a situation that should have at least been reported to the authorities long before the final show down."
1	'"Star" rating system needs revising for this book. Considering the absurd plot, cardboard characters, poor grammar and misuse of it, a -3 would seem more appropriate.\n I\'m going to "loose" this book so that no one else in my family can get "a hold" of it {unless they have "all ready" got it}.'
1	'did not catch my attention when reading'
1	"This book isn't worth it. It's short and doesn't really give you much detail. Just short paragraphs summing up what happened and the sentence each one received. It was boring and not worth a dime"
1	'Too short to be useful and too unscrupulous to trust it - literally says "your [Twitter] account might get suspended but who cares? Make another one." Even the measly 5 minutes it took to read through this was too much time wasted!'
2	'I just found them... infuriating, I suppose.  I really dislike the "I know he\'s all powerful and I\'m not but I\'m going to do what I want anyway because I can\'t just sit here" mentality, and these books were full of that.  And full of obstacles to a happy ending that felt super contrived, like the books were just dragging on for the sake of writing more books.  I wound up skimming through the last 2 just so I could see what happened without being any more invested than I had to be.'
1	'This "books" is simply not a book. Everything that is said here is absolutely obvious to anyone. Some of the advice is rather misleading and actually contradicts many more reliable sources. In addition, the section about female body language and attraction seems to indicate that pretty much anything a woman does implies that she\'s sexually attracted to you. Quite ridiculous.'
1	'Worst of the Blake boys series. And none of them were bad actually but this sucked.'
1	"I was extremely upset that this was as short as it was. It left me trying to figure out just what happened to the story.  I think this person is a good writer; i just didn't read enough to give him/her a valued opinion."
1	"(Note:  I'm not discounting his knowledge or strength!)\n\nOnly gave it one star cuz I ordered on Nov 29th, 2014 and never received my copy.  I got a lovely pdf (which I cannot read), and I did NOT order a pdf.  I ordered a book.  Ya know... The thing you can hold in your hand and highlight and take to the gym.\n\nWendler's customer service is sub par!!\n\nAlso, I ordered a physical copy!  If it helps, it was invoice:  456gemss6tr0gie4q1il"
1	"Other than the plot of the story, there really wasn't anything good about the book.  The plot was what got me, but the author really didn't elaborate on it. It's really sad, this had all the makings on being a great read."
1	"this has got to be the worst crap I've ever seen printed... how were they able to get it published!!"
1	"Some good advice, but seriously falls flat. I don't see how this therory could stop a divorce or make you ex want you back. Worst purchase I have ever made the sad part is that I cannot get a refund on it. save your time, energy and money and do not purchase this if you are serious about getting back with your ex."
2	'I felt like this was a copycat from the Johnny B Truant series.'
1	"This book was HORRIBLE from beginning to end. I will not be purchasing anything from these author's ever again. If I could give these authors advice it would be to put the pen down and walk away from the key board. We all are destined to be something great but writing isn't for you.  I usually read urban fiction so I thought I would try something different. I think I'm going to stop reading books all together."
2	"Bummer!  I want to read the whole book.  Didn't know there was a readers digest format available.  I guess it work if you like short cuts"
1	'Dealt with some real issues. But poorly researched. Desperately needed an editor who speaks English. No feel of Regency England. Waste of time.'
1	"I have so many objections to this book I don't know where to begin! This is no recipe book. It is an instruction book of how to use artificial sweetener, canned products and processed food. Anyone using this book needs to do a little research on the effects of aspartame and processed food. It is hardly guilt-free! If you know how to cook & care about what you put into your body, then don't waste your time.."
1	"I bought this book last week and as is customary for myself flipped through the pages to check out the photos and overall format of this book. I was delighted to see a poem by a poet that I know. I called to congratulate this poet on being published only to be told they knew nothing about it. The poem was published without permission.\nThat being said, I have to be honest and admit that I did not make it through this book. One of the very few that I have not. She over describes everything and her sentences run on and on and on. It's the same stuff as her other books but somehow worse as this book is a long one. She would of been better off just publishing everyone else's work and leaving her's out of it. Providing she gets permission first. I'd like to end by saying that it's fraudulent to write your own 5 star reviews. Save your money people."
1	'Save your money. English version but some paragraphs in German. How weird is that. Also it drags on and on, paragraph after paragraph then it comes to an unreadable chart. Not a good Kindle choice.'
2	'The story, although it did have potential, suffers badly from poor writing. This was one of those books where it seemed the author has trouble getting what was in his mind on to the printed page. The premise was good, but the execution was not.'
1	"Did not care for the language. The title seemed heat, but the subject matter and the lifestyle and language, I did not want to read. So I didn't. I just passed each page up till the book was done."
1	"These books used to be a good story line ... But the author seems to have become obsessed with dominance and submissive roles in the writing.  The book went on and on with the ransom night stuff and a female being tortured.... I skipped over all of that hoping for a good story otherwise ... But this was pretty disappointing. Guess I won't be reading the wolf stories any longer."
1	"Swim away, far far away. I am not entirely sure as the the point of this authors vision. I'm sure they thought this was a work of art. Sadly this lacked in all areas. Only positive was the characters were authentic."
1	"In my opinion, this is pretty general stuff, stuff I could have told you, a lot even before I had a child. If you are on your 1st one and this eBook is free, by all means get it, but it's a waste of time to read or buy otherwise."
1	'Not very good. Crazy talk about conspiracies. Waste of time. Would not recommend. Stay away. Waste of time and money.'
2	"Not much to say here. It was only about a chapter long. And about Cia's brother, Zeen, which was kind of cool.

2	"This was my first book by Ms. Sjoberg.  It also felt like Ms. Sjoberg's first book.  The writing was competent, the dialogue was natural and the characters were three-dimensional...just...\n\nThe whole story lacked oomph, lacked spark, lacked life.  Got it!  It was lackluster.  Everything just simply happened.  There wasn't any build up to anything, the characters had interesting back stories but they were never explored.  Mason never had a heart to heart talk with Kayla about his past and she never spoke to him about her accident.\n\nThat's supposed to happen, it's called intimacy, yet they never really talked about meaningful things.  The author told us about them.\n\nSo, not horrible, not noteworthy.  Just okay."

1	"Dreadful.  I really don't understand how books like this can be published.  I don't think I have ever read anything with as many typographical and spelling errors.  It was so bad that I got to the point where I was counting to see how many errors Mr Comer could squeeze onto one page - the winner was 8.  It was so bad that I kept forgetting the plot - I was so immersed in finding errors.  Anyway, if your standards are so low that you can ignore these errors then you might be interested to know that the story was awful too.  Actually, it was a short story.  It's about a captain leading a trio of sloops laden with arms, supplies and soldiers across the Atlantic to South Carolina, where the Brits are engaged in battles against the Colonials.  Mr Comer is one of these authors that doesn't bother himself too much with triviality, so he skips one or two things along the way.  Such as the actual sailing across the Atlantic with these three unstable and overloaded boats, manned by inexperienced crews and bad captains.  Mr Comer got them across in about two small paragraphs - and the fearless hero managed to quell a mutiny along the way. No more Comer for me."
1	'This story feels like something a sex starved teenager wrote.\nThere are many, many unrealistic situations (the dude has a twelve inch dick for starters) and the dialogue feels clunky.\nI understand that everyone has different tastes when it comes to bedroom activities and relationships, but Dane (the male protagonist) is a controling, violent and irrational person. He literally claimed to, "own" this poor woman and child he stalked for weeks. If it were up to him, he would never let her leave the house.\nAnother thing I found agrivating about this book was Iilen\'s lack of inner strength. "Oops, the big, strong man is mad at me for something that was out of my control, better look down and let him put his hands on me."\nTo be fair, it\'s only takes a couple hours to read, and if you use your imagination, the sex scenes are pretty hot.'
2	'I read I thought it would get better'
1	"I'm embarrassed to read this to my 6 year old, who can write better than this. Nothing worse than bad, forced rhymes."
2	'First off, I\'d like to say I tried very hard to make this book work for me. I tried even harder to give the book 3 stars because the author writes rather well. However, I found it impossible to grasp the fundamental plot and theme of the book. There were just WAY too many issues the protagonist had to deal with OTHER than leaving George. The story is not only unbelievable, it\'s improbable, illogical, and in some cases...just plain ridiculous. I hate giving a review like this because it feels unfair to an author I\'m sure worked very hard and diligent to make the book happen.\n\nThe protagonist of the story leaves an abusive marriage and keeps getting re-victimized...so much so that at one point she feels that she should have stayed with her cheating, physically violent, lousy husband. Then, this woman gets beat to a pulp, called the "B" word repeatedly, and falsely accused of stealing by other men more dangerous than her husband. I had to speed read my way through this book just to finish...so I wouldn\'t feel guilty about doing the review. I believe Ms. Dickson is quite talented and capable of much better work...I\'d even like to see it. That\'s why I hated doing this review...she writes nicely. Anyway, some of her general concepts are decent so you may enjoy this book more than I did...there are certainly other reviews that attest to that much. Also, the book was free - which makes a huge difference when reading disappointing books.'
2	'I liked the cover.  The premise of the story was cute.  The execution of the story was average.  The few small pictures were cute, but not enough of them.  The font was horrendous and distracted from the story. A children\'s book should not look like it\'s been written on a typewriter.  With so many exciting fonts out there, certainly the author could have found a child friendly one.\n\nThe premise of the story is about two pumpkins who want to be jack-o-lanterns, but haven\'t been picked.\n\nI have to admit that I did have some stray thoughts while reading this children\'s book.  Sentient pumpkins that wish to be carved up, I kept thinking about this and it made me uncomfortable.  I kept thinking wouldn\'t it have been better if the jack-o-lantern was trapped inside the pumpkin and needed someone to allow jack to "escape" by carving the pumpkin?  The second is the description of the pumpkins moving "up and down, and all around the drying vines and dirt clods to the", Now the pumpkins didn\'t have legs , so did they roll?  If they did roll, why didn\'t the author describe it that way, if they didn\'t roll how did they move?  I think these are the type of strange questions a young child would ask while being read the story.\n\nI also think buyers should be aware that the main story is only 50% of the book.  The last 50% is actually the beginning of another children\'s book, I would think for an older audience than "Pumper".  I read the excerpt, but will not be looking to purchase it as I found the writing to be sophomoric.\n\nIn conclusion, the story is decent, but the execution needs to be polished.  I believe this book could have been majorly improved by breaking up the story and adding several more pictures.\n\nTurner, Tiffany (2011-10-18). Pumper the Pumpkin (Kindle Location 68).  .

"If something like homeopathy worked, it upended everything we believe about our physical and biological reality. One of the two - homeopathy or standard medical science had to be wrong."  This distortion of logic was too bold, overly assuming & even nonsensical - but then, it now did require the author to offer-up proof that homeopathy worked so we (the readers) could now witness Madison Avenue at it\'s Finest, like the "hook" of the Sit-Coms to tune in after commercial breaks, and be consumed with her Ed, Bill, Hal, Bernie, Fritz Popp (33 and good-looking), Benveniste, etc., specululate on matters truly philosophical. Intermixed are vague references to E=MC2, holography, PAF, \'photon sucking\', DNA, Zero Point Field (HPF),ADIS, OJ Simpson, telekinesis, REG, RNG, EDA & a revelation that homeopathy works by memory imparted to water so to exhibit \'coherent domains\' via coherent photons, a process where "shaking of the containers, as is done in homeopathy, appears to act as a method of speeding up the process," concluding "water is like a tape recorder, imprinting & carrying information whether the original molecule is still there or not."\n\nThe author writes dangerously well for the near & non-scientific community, the \'New Age\', & those won\'t to mythologies of sorts.'

The test failed miserably. Out of 10 words that I did not know, the dictionary did not find 3. I think 30% failing words is about 29% too much.\n\nAlso, the words that the dictionary did find provided only one translation, which is not typical in foreign languages. Usually there isn't one exact translation that fits all the uses of the foreign word.\n\nComparing the price/quality, this dictionary is not worth buying unfortunately."
2	"I don't know what I was expecting when I ordered this book, but I didn't like it from the start.  I should have ordered the sample first.  It's not that it was well written, it just wasn't my cup of tea"
2	'This was very disappointing. The synopsis made this book sound interesting and there were so many high ratings, that I expected more of this book. As is, I didn\'t hate it, but I didn\'t like it, either.\n\nThe plot reads like a bad cheesy romantic comedy. The kind where the heroine uses an elaborate (and utterly unbelievable) plot to force the hero into expressing his feelings for her. Frankly, I just want to shake the heroine and tell her that if you have to force the hero to acknowledge that he loves you, he doesn\'t really love you.\n\nThe hero is so unlikable and selfish, and I couldn\'t see how the heroine falls for him. Throughout the story, he\'s using another woman to get a business deal to go through and keeps stringing the woman along to get what he wants. Even after he falls for the heroine, he continues to court the other woman, knowing that he\'s being a jerk and unscrupulous, and that he could lose the heroine, but he still does it. He consciously decides to put his own desires before the feelings of any other person. He only finally gives up the other woman when it becomes clear that he has to or lose the heroine. He\'s basically strong-armed into being a good guy and does so at the absolute last minute. I just didn\'t like him at all. He\'s a good father, but that\'s about all you can say about him.\n\nEven the "great love" he had with his first wife, which is supposed to make you feel sympathetic towards him made me not like him. He moons over his dead wife, but every time he talks about her or thinks about her, the only things he ever really mentions is that she was a good estate manager and that he could leave her to take care of all that business, so he could go do what he really wanted. It\'s painted to seem like although their marriage was arranged, they fell deeply in love, but as you read about her, it seems more like she was a good partner and helpful, but not someone he really loved romantically.\n\nFrankly, the synopsis felt a little misleading. I expected a story about an undesirable woman who falls in love with a heartbroken widower, but between her insecurities and his mourning, it takes a while for them to come together. Really, neither of those things played a huge role. The heroine\'s insecurities are mentioned occasionally, but then she loses a bunch of weight and becomes the most beautiful woman in London (and I already mentioned the issues with the hero\'s dead wife). Those impediments are easily gotten over fairly quickly and then it\'s a story about a guy who won\'t pursue the heroine because he wants to use another woman to get a good business deal.'

1	"I'm not sure what I expected, but it wasn't this. The characters were not developed, and quite frankly they were ridiculous. The dialogue between the characters was dull, flat and predictable as was the end of the story. I skipped sentences out of sheer boredom and just to get it finished.

1	"But it's not. The climax is at the start story, and it's all downhill from there, there is no buildup, and when it shows potential for a more exciting story, it ends, right there!\n\nThere is very little if any character growth and the best this story has to offer is over with too soon. Heck the erotic part of the story is feeble and half assed. I would excuse that if this were a story where it is about overcoming a problem but its not, and Id excuse the poor story if it were about the sex, but its not.\n\nI hate saying this about written work really but I wouldnt recommend this at all even if its free. Its a sad waste of time, you expect more and its just a disappointment to read."

I don't remember if it was discussed but I don't think they ever lived together as siblings. The way she wanted to lose her virginity was odd and it was nice the boy was reluctant. I'm disappointed she had decided before the date to have sex but did nothing to protect herself. The story line about why he was going out with her didn't work for me.

2	"I was really conflicted reading this series!! On one hand the sex is VERY hot and there's a lot interesting sexual situations that you don't usually see in traditional BDSM romance. There's a lot I can set aside when reading erotica, including a ridiculous premise (like a reality-porn competition for doms that doesn't include any subs where everyone just dominates everyone else and whoever doms the best wins a million dollars???). And I would have given this series a pass if it weren't for all the other issues with the books.\n\nThe writing: absolutely haywire, like what is actually happening in any of these scenes?!?\nThe main characters: never any evolution! Tara and Lucien have these super intense, vulnerable, crazy sex scenes and ten minutes later Tara's all 'OMG I couldn't possibly be naked in front of you, ew!' and Lucien just mopes around and wonders why Tara doesn't feel the same way. And this pattern was just repeated, and repeated, and repeated until it just wan't logical anymore. Like, does Tara have some sort of short-term-memory loss problem?? Is this the BDSM version of 50 first dates?\nThe plot: needlessly repetitive, would have been much more interesting if by book 3 the characters were out of the competition and had to navigate their relationship in the real world"
2	"Silver Dove is the sequel to Silver Lining. Silver Lining was a free purchase and Silver Dove was free to read with Unlimited. Currently Silver Dove is on limited sale for only 99 cents if I wanted to complete the set. Problem is I didn't like Silver Dove enough to waste 99 cents which is sad. The plot beginning with book one begins as Amber's first fiance cancels their wedding. Amber's inability to cope has left her scarred and afraid of relationships and men. Amber then meets Craig in a bar and it's instant attraction. Two books worth of life's little bumps and Amber's shrew-like whining, poor coping skills, and obsessive need for a child turns poor Craig to drink. (I don't blame the guy at all.) I just couldn't like Amber. I tried to like her, I really did but I failed.) Amber is a whiny, neurotic woman who needs professional counseling. IMO the author needed to write Amber with at least a few redeeming qualities because I certainly couldn't find any in either book. Once again the ending is a HEA but it's predictable. The plot gets thin in a couple of chapters and comes close to being a bad cliche. I'm passing on the author and all future installments.\n\nformerly known as Luv My Amazon Prime"

I googled "era of video" and his website was nowhere to be found. Some SEO? I can usually find some actionable information regardless of how poorly a book is written. But the book left me wondering if the information he did give was credible because he failed to get me to "know him, like him or trust him," which he touts as the message you should give to your prospective customers so that they will take action..

I got this as a free download from the Kindle bookstore. This review is based on the short story only and not the excerpt.\n\nThe basic premise of the book, this story, and the upcoming television series is that people are mysteriously returning from the dead as if nothing has happened. However, life has gone on for their family and friends, and no one knows what to make of the returned.\n\nIn this story, the first known of "The Returned," Edmund, shows up at work a year after his death from being hit by a bus. His fianc, Emily, sees him on television after she though that she had dealt with the loss. She decides to try to make her way to him, and runs into an accident of her own.\n\nThis story is a reunion of two loves, but I did not feel any connection to the characters. I understand that this is a short story/teaser, but there was not enough here for me. There was very little backstory for the characters, and I just could not feel the love and urgency as a result. I also found the reactions to the return of Edmund to be a little too easy. Emily\'s mother, for example, took it all in stride, while Emily did at least struggle a little with Edmund\'s return.\n\nI have to say that this story did not make me any more interested in the full novel at all. However, after reading this story, I first watched the preview for the series and then read&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/The-Sparrow-The-Returned/dp/B00BV2WC0W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">The Sparrow (The Returned)</a>.

2	"Previous reviews had me looking forward to this short story. It may have worked better if the author had taken the time to explain the magic the arbiters command. Manna sword? And was the casual self stabbing (to be re-energized? Wha-?) supposed to shock the reader or confuse him? D'arden Tal is blessed with premonitions that, inspite of years of rigorous training and two years spent traveling with an alleged Master, he consistently ignores. This entire confrontation, in fact, feels like it is his first. Ever. Master Havox, who grins incessantly and most irritatingly, leaves this poor sap mostly on his own, then 'wisely' figures out the whole problem and *snap,* we're done. It felt like he is either crazy or knows something the reader does not -- and never will. The setting lent an air of creepiness,  but I still want to know what those original lights were and where they went. Too many details are either missing or don't make sense. The story is, at best, unfinished. As a prologue, it did nothing to inspire me to look for further works."

1	"First I have to say I am a huge fan of the Fifty Shades series. Absolutely loved the books & the movie. However, this book was horrible. I was super excited when I heard it was coming out and pre-ordered it as soon as I could. Now, I wish I would not have done that so I could have my money back. This was basically just a repeat of the first book. We all know what the contract says and it really didn't need to be reprinted again, seemed like the author was just trying to fill space. In the first books I knew Christian had issues, but still thought he was a pretty awesome guy, in control, dominant and sexy, but this books just makes him look pitiful, needy & whiney... Also, the fact that this only covers book is even worse. This book could have been written so much better and covered all 3 books and really given us a book from his point and not this rambling, desperate half done book."
1	'Very poorly proof-read!  Somebody should tell the author to do a spellcheck on Word or whatever processor he uses.  Very distracting.  As to the meat of the book, I was not very impressed by his level of expertise in this field.  I think that I know more about it than he does, and I am a virtual novice.  There is very little of substance; I think he wrote the book after reading a couple of other, better books on the subject.  Not enough meat on this bone...'
2	'It really saddens me when a good storyline is destroyed by grammatical errors.\nAnd I mean all throughout the book.\nWords missing and everything.\nQuick read though. Mildly entertaining otherwise.'
1	"What a sleazy strategy. Ironic that a book that advocates buying fake reviews has so many good reviews. Wonder where those came from? I'm sure they're all honest, unsolicited opinions offered by legitimate purchasers. Skip this book if you have a shred of moral decency. I hope the author enjoys his 4-hour work weeks while they last. This jig will be up shortly."

1	"In general I love this author but I have now read every book he has put on Amazon and they have gotten progressively worse !! This book wasn't edited, right from early in the book to the last chapter there are grammar mistakes, missing words in sentences- Frequently. Basically anything you can imagine. It makes this book so impossible to read when you are just going along enjoying the story and there are multiple errors per chapter.  I don't understand how a book can be put out in this condition"
1	'Poorly written, hard to follow early on and how wonderful the kids are just gets tedious and downright tiresome. Tried to stick it out but could not finish it.'
2	"This book attempts to help the reader understand Thomas Pynchon's debut novel V.\nThe novel really isn't too difficult to understand by itself but if you are intetested in keeping track of the many characters or a plot breakdown then this is a place to start but it should be noted it is by no means the best place to start.\nThere is no help with decyfering the various obscure and hidden references in the novel.\nThere isn't an interactive TOC so flipping to the various sections becomes tedious quickly.\nIf you are too lazy to read V or you have a paper on it due tomorrow buy this.\nIf not then read it with pleasure and use the internet to help you when necessary."
1	'This isn\'t a publisher-published book. This is Amazon printing the ripped-off text of this book because it\'s out of copyright, in a word-processed document, on the cheapest and flimsiest paper imaginable, putting a slap-dash cover on it, and printing it on-demand when you order it. They take every penny, paying nothing to a publisher or Burnett\'s heirs. It looks and feels like junk, and it shouldn\'t be supported.

1	'The story was interesting enough but the manuscript was clearly not proofed or prepared. Obvious typos and errors and misplaced words'
2	"Ms. Bladon, I don't think your cliffhangers are valid. You leave your readers feeling annoyed with you. You stop a scene completely in order to have us scrambling for the second and third installment. I'm writing this review after having read all four books. The cliffhangers? Annoying. I'll likely steer from purchasing your books again. They're exhausting and lackluster."

1	"I don't know if Monica actually believes the things she writes, or if she is just a paid propagandist, but either way it's shocking and disheartening that any critical thinking American could possibly take any of this utter drivel seriously.  People...please wake up from this divisive left/right, Democrat/Republican, we're right/they're wrong nonsense.  The republicans and the democrats are BOTH hideously corrupt and they are BOTH responsible for destroying this country.  You wanna know 'what the (bleep) just happened'?  Bankers and corporations have seized control of the government, that's what happened.  The regulatory structure in the financial system that was put in place in the 1930s to prevent another Great Depression--and that worked effectively for about 7 decades--was systematically dismantled by....um....republicans AND democrats; Bush, Clinton, Bush, AND Obama.\nThe economic situation in the U.S. is dire, and it's not going to get any better regardless of who gets 'elected'.  The idea that either party is going to usher in a Utopian era is utterly ridiculous, and reflects a profound ignorance of how our government works and who is in control.  Our politicians--republicans and democrats alike--have sold out the American people, sent our jobs abroad, and allowed bankers and CEOs to run rampant and plunder the prosperity of what was once the 'middle class'.  Monica's book is nothing but pathetic establishment propaganda mascarading as patriotic commentary.  She should put on shorts and a t-shirt and go serve chicken wings at Hooters where she belongs.  How anyone could take this fool seriously is just astonishing.\nThe biggest crisis in America right now is a hypnotized public that gets their information from outlets like Fox (the pathetic propaganda arm of the republican party) and MSNBC (the pathetic propaganda arm of the democrat party).  We, as a people, need to wake up and say NO to this nonsense once and for all.  The mouthpieces on TV...from both ends of the spectrum...are nothing but paid liars who are there to convince us that our broken and nauseating political system is legitimate.  Once you wake up from this illusion of left/right rhetoric, you realize that there really isn't much difference between Bush (republicans) and Obama (democrats) except on cosmetic foolish distractions like gay marriage, and to believe that either party has all the answers (or ANY answers, for that matter) is profoundly stupid."
2	"The content didn't work as this was too superficial.  There was nothing in either character to even hint that love had blossomed because they were just so wonderful and it couldn't be helped although we were told this.  It was a superficial plot with an excuse for some action.  It was short, thank goodness, but even that didn't help.  Readers need to connect and this had no connection but perhaps it might work if content is all you want."
1	'Very disappointing.  Bought for Kindle but cannot do any of puzzles.'
2	"I am a dog-lover (have had 6; currently own 3) and also a huge fan of our military men and women. I have the utmost respect for those who don the uniform to protect America and preserve our freedoms, and I actively support the Wounded Warrior Project. So I was looking forward to enjoying this book. Alas, it was not to be.\n\nThough I enjoyed the parts of this book about Tuesday and his loyalty toward Mr. Montalvan, I grew weary of reading the same thing over and over and over. The book is 288 pages--I think it could've easily been cut to 200 without losing any impact. There are only so many times I need to be reminded how Tuesday put his head on Montalvan's lap, or retrieved his shoes, or leaned into him, or looked at him with expressive eyes.\n\nOthers have commented that many of the writer's claims are not true. I cannot speak to that, but I will state that much of the book is devoted to Montalvan's frustration with Army decisions, the brass not knowing what they're doing, lack of support, etc. His anti-military establishment rants and second-guessing began to sound very familiar and grew tiresome after a while. (Hindsight is always 20/20, is it not?)\n\nIronically, he criticizes GWB's lack of leadership and was frustrated by the unresponsiveness of the Veterans Administration toward wounded vets, but after attending the 2009 Obama inaugural was excited about a new direction. One can't help but wonder in 2014 if the rudderless foreign policy, the Benghazi debacle, and the horrible VA scandal has dampened his enthusiasm for Obama's promise of hope and change.\n\nYes, the book is repetitive, but worse than that is the lack of flow. In many chapters the author jumps back and forth between present and past, sometimes multiple times. In other chapters he jumps forward, then comes back to the present. This lack of chronological consistency contributes to a fragmented account of many of the events he describes.\n\nI love dogs, and I love our wounded warriors, but I did not love this book.\n\nGood luck in all you do, Captain Montalvan. And thank you very much for your service to this great country of ours."
1	'Incomplete super short stories. Lots of errors.  A Disappointment. A SELF-published nightmare. Do not waste your time reading this drivel.'
1	'Sounded like a politician with the man-made "global warming" BS.'
2	'Disappointing is the only word to use for this short story. That it is only a short story was not clear when I bought it and it is quick read, stylistically like all Miranda Corbie mysteries but not as well written'
2	'I found it very difficult to find my way around and understand the directions, i.e.; NOT having an index until it was "filled".  Very hard to access, print at bottom too small, confusing about underlining, finding scriptures and generally, not a good way to read the Bible.  I might try to find one that is more $ and maybe it will be easier to comprehend.'
1	"It was a boring story about a character I couldn't emphasize with."
1	"Not my kind of book. I didn't like how she called him Daddy, was just plain wrong considering she's his daughters best friend. I found some scenes uncomfortable such as with the belt. The price is ridiculous for what it is. I'm only happy i got it on KU otherwise i would have asked for a refund. The editing was atrocious. Frankly i'm not sure if Ms Silver has an ego problem now but she doesn't put as much effort into her books as she used to and then she complains they don't sell. I don't think i'll be able to face reading one of her books again because they just seem to go from bad to worse."
1	'no jokes were funny at all.'
2	"Hot men in these books but the story line is sooooo old!  seriously?  pantyhose, wall phones, making sure your dress is right above your knee?  is this 1970?  if this was 're edited and modernized might be a good story.  Lauren acts like my grandmother."
2	"Okay, you can't expect a comic writer to capture the spirit or a TV show like Star Trek but this short comic leaves a lot lacking in terms of basic plot and logical story construction.\n\nSkip this."

2	'I usually LOVE Ruby Shae books.  However this book made me angry.  It showcased the heroine as a weak individual.  No woman with any self respect would allow a guy to treat them like s*** constantly.'
1	'I did not expect to be written about Allah. I thought I was getting a good details out of book of Revelations. Otherwise it was something different.'
2	'Entice starts off where the second book left off, which was incredibly captivating and interesting.  However, this book does not make the cut.  It was slow and the entire book was the just the same thing after another, there were no interesting highlights to it.  The whole book focused only on getting Nick back.  The characters were flat and boreing, unlike the first 2 books where they came alive.  Very disappointed.'
2	"i won't ruin the storyline for those of you who actually want to read it but it seemed a little hard to believe. certain characters act in ways for which i can see no reason, others devote years to pointless endeavors which even they don't value.\nthe main character is both incredibly cavalier about human life and then an emotional baby tormented by guilt. he has a power which automatically warns him about events in the future but the author apparently forgets this after a few chapters and he doesn't see blows coming, stumbles over objects where previously he foresaw them, and generally displays a lack of said power."
1	"I completely agree with DTG9000--the Junie B. books are awful!  The character is not a child I would want my daughter to emulate by any means. My daughter is a first grader and having read two of these books, we've had enough of this little stinker's antics and commentary--apart from cheeky behavior, the grammar is inappropriate for children learning the English language, too. What is author Barbara Park thinking??  What kind of education is she seeking to provide??  Give these books a pass."
2	'At first I thought it a good book, but this book just has recipe without any picture inside. So boring.'
1	"I did not enjoy this book whatsoever.  The writing is choppy. The story does not flow well.  The author doesn't do a good job of describing anything.  You are forced to put too many pieces together yourself.  It was not an enjoyable read."
1	'The episode really Qatari short but the prime membership made it worth it.  Too much foul language used for my liking.'
2	'In some instances quite unbelievable.  Gives me the feeling of fabrication.  Don\'t misunderstand I truly believe in all of this but I do question some of the "instances."'
1	"VERY poor usage of to,too,your,you're, know,no, ran consistently thruout. Author seemed to be stretching storyline out by having main characters repeatedly beat or shoot each other,recover,and do it over...you'd think one of them would make sure the other was dead early on...Didn't seem to be any other plot. Book was free,but I wouldn't recommend."
1	'Nothing new'
2	'I don\'t understand why this book is called "WEDDING ON THE ROCKS".  You would think that the entire story would be about a couple who is engaged and then runs into trouble before the wedding.  Yeah, naw.  That is NOT what this story is about.  Jennifer Edwards, our heroine, leaves her small town of Faith, South Dakota for the bright city lights of Chicago, Illinois to pursue a career in journalism.  Up for a promotion as beauty editor for a magazine geared towards teenage girls, she is called home when her father suffers a stroke and needs her help on the ranch.  Being a dutiful daughter, she goes home, only to run into Brett Lange, the boy she left behind, who is now an archaeology professor living on her father\'s ranch.  Brett has always loved Jennifer - and the whole town knows it - she appears to be the only one who doesn\'t.  Can this small town boy win the heart of a citified woman?\n\nThe plot has been done over and over again, and unfortunately for me, this time it was not done well.  From the beginning, there is a hint that Brett "saved" Jennifer from some harm or hurt while they were in high school.  It is alluded to several times in the beginning of the book.  When the secret is finally revealed, the reader is disappointed that the rescue is so mundane.  And even though you suspect that the two lovebirds will eventually get together, how they come to the realization that they cannot live without each other is unbelievable and boring.  It\'s like the author only had so many pages to tell the story, realized that she was nearing the end of her page count and then rushed to the finish.  It was very disjointed, convoluted and ultimately disappointing to this reader.'
2	'I honestly felt like I was reading a YA instead of a mature paranormal romance.\n\nIf it wasn\'t for the sex I would have definitely thought it was YA. The book was just Bleh and the whole nick thing is obvious. The characters were weak and predictable.\nI wish the main female character (forgot her name I think it\'s ally) had more of a back bone. She talks about being all tough and independent but she\'s just a damsel in distress.\nThe main male character David isn\'t any better but his character is bearable at least.\n\nThere\'s just really nothing special about this book. There really wasn\'t much world building since the book is focusing on the characters love and lust story.\nThe villain or villains are OK I guess. It\'s basically some psycho who cant get it up unless he\'s killing, torturing, or just beating his victim. Abusive much?\nHe goes on a rampage to get succubi to make it easier for him to enjoy his lack of sex life.\n\nThis psycho (probably more than one. Don\'t know. Won\'t be finishing the book) is going after ally because he just has to doesn\'t he?\nMeanwhile ally and David are dealing with their own "should we be together or nah" dilema. Their solution is to have sex and deny their growing feelings for each other. Yay.\nDNF at 62%.'

1	'It really is just the screen play.'
2	'Ok story but I find comparative stupidity of the rest of the galaxy versus humans to be difficult to accept but it is sci-fi.\n\nThe writing is awful. On almost every page there are words missing, misused, or wrong. For example a ship expended all its missiles but the author wrote expanded instead. It makes the book hard to read trying to decode what he meant, and a simple word processor would solve most of the errors.'

2	'The author presents multiple assertions about NoSQL technologies and who/what are using them but does not provide any reasonable backing to what they are saying. The book reads as though points were taken from the webs many various sources, collated and organized, and then presented as a book.\n\nThe author specifies Redis as the minimum bar for being a key store but does not provide any technical reasons for it except to say that is has lots of useful capabilities.\n\nIf you consistently read the web about NoSQL technology, you can safely pass on this collection of information.'
2	'Begins with a bible verse about love, then on wedding day she has sex with a stranger all day. .  I bounce through looking for the moral of the story only to skip more sex, so to see ending I see Lucy is well, and the. Couple are getting married. Marriage should have been in the beginning not the ending.'
2	'This book may be good for someone who has never run a business, or worked in any kind of management position. It has a few decent thoughts, but this is not anything close to a replacement for a real education or experience.'
2	'I hate to leave a bad review but this book was horrible it was too rushed and didn\'t quite make any sense.  Came across and "goldiggerish" even though she said she was not!'
2	"I had trouble finishing the book once I realized a story was not developing. I kept reading to see where it was going and it didn't."
2	"I think the author should have made this more of a history reaccounting that just stating facts but if that is all you are looking for maybe you'll like it - It just didn't compel me to read on and on"
1	'The revisionists have been hard at work re-writing history.  Very sad to lose a great piece of work. I wish the blacks would leave our history alone.'
1	'I loved the other books in this series but this had one sex scene about 30% of the entire book.'
2	'This version did not have the commentary notes or the original Hebrew. Good limited version however. Worth looking at if you do not mind the limitations.'
1	"I usually rate titles highly, but not this one. You can get the same information from WebMD.com. Completely worthless in my opinion and either English is the author's second language or he should employ someone to edit, check for grammar and check for spelling mistakes."
1	'i would not tell anyone to read this book it was not a goo read os stay clear of it.'
1	'This book is nothing like what I have come to expect from Stephanie Brother. I have read several novels by Stephanie, and when I read this one, all I can seem to think is, "Who in the world wrote this? There is no way this is Stephanie\'s work."\n\nThis is unfeeling and just bland. It all read out more like a teenager\'s diary entry than a romance novel.\n\nI love Stephanie Brother as a writer, but this is not something I can recommend.'
1	'It\'s cut down way too much.  It might do for someone who wants a "cliffs notes" version of Mansfield Park, but no real Austen fan will enjoy it.'
1	'I am very surprised by the many glowing reviews for this book. I had a lot of problems with it. So many, in fact, that I didn\'t even finish reading it. The book bounces around, skimming over parts that could have been used to build a solid relationship between the two main characters. Instead, it seems the author was bored and just wanted to get to other parts of the book, like writing "combustible love scenes" that were severely lacking. I don\'t like the heroine. I find her crass and one dimensional. The male character is promiscuous in front of the heroine and it paints him in a bad light. There is nothing redeeming about him and I am  unsympathetic towards him.\n\nFinally, I stopped reading when I came to a very offensive line. The main character\'s girl friends want to give her a makeover and the author uses this line as a description. "Feeling like she was being led the gas chamber, Piper lifted her head resolutely."\n\nI stopped reading immediately. What sort of "author" would compare getting a make over to a gas chamber? It was revolting and a terrible analogy. Please don\'t waste your time on this terrible dribble. Its poorly written, not very interesting and as the title of my review says it all: offensive.'
2	'The plot is good, might make a good movie.\n\n Maybe it is just the Kindle edition but there are lots of places where phrases are left out and a placeholder, like the letter "B" is substituted, almost as if the author had made a note to come back and edit the section, but had never had the chance.  There were some just laughable background errors, like stating that liquid nitrogen was fuel for a rocket and could explode at any time.  All of these detracted from a smooth read.\n\nIf there were a second edition published after some good editing and some background descriptions on the geography this could be a good book.'
1	"Started off kinda nice in the dreams... But once they met for in person it didn't go well and was honestly too weird and too complicated and I HATED IT! Off to delete ."
2	"I got bored a few times. Not sure what it was about the story that wasn't holding my attention. Perhaps because it so closely followed several other story lines from other books. I noticed a few repeat scenes from the previous book as well. My biggest complaint was Angel seems very blah as a character without any kind of backbone."
2	"I want to like this book. Poor phrasing and scene descriptions, along with crappy assumptions about biospheres that could easily be remedied by spending 15 minutes online, make me need to put this book away without finishing it.\n\nAuthor. Get yourself a real editor. Also take intro to writing.\n\nAt least you didn't spell defense with a 'c'."
1	'This book is an uncritical examinations of technology and culture in which the only conclusions the authors seem capable of drawing regards today\'s complex global socio-economic reality are that almost all contemporary social and economic problems can be solved by participation in the borderless neo-liberal economy and a shared religious like faith in the technological innovation that it facilitates.\n\nThe fact that Ayesha Khanna is an advisor to the Singularity University - many of whose faculty of techno-inititates hold an almost millennial belief in a "singularity" or an end of history like event after which it will become possible to digitize and upload human consciousness into "spiritual machines"- certainly helps to explain the authors techno-zealotry.\n\nUsing the work of Alvin and Heidi Toffler as a jumping off point (one sees in the Khannas\' interpretation of "Future Shock" why the books is also a favorite of Newt Gingrich) the Khannas\' weave a narrative about the what a glorious future is in store for all those who learn to appropriate the new technologies to become aspiring entrepreneurs of the digital age.\n\nThe Khannas\' appear to view Asian authoritarian capitalism, such as practiced in China or Singapore, as role models for the Future Societies they envision.  Not surprisingly those places are well served by technocratic regimes since the few voices of dissent within can be quickly extinguished through the security apparatus of the all seeing surveillance state that the new digital technologies - for all the good they may do - also enable.\n\nWhile one expects an optimistic assessment of Technology from any TED talk or book, one has an expectation to at least see an attempt at a critical interrogation -or even a nuanced view-  of what may be some other darker sides of the new "hybrid reality". But, except for a few short paragraphs in which they mention the problems associated with the digital divide, that some Africans may have to toil to mine hazardous materials that go into electronic devices, or that ariel drones may also be used by drug cartels in the future, this critique is largely absent from the book.\n\nMoreover, although the new found glories of India\'s participation in the global knowledge economy are duly noted it is surprising for these authors of Indian decent that they never once mention the almost 250,000 farmers in India who have committed suicide in the past fifteen years. An event that has in large part been credibly linked to the genetically modified (hybrid) seeds these poor farmers must now purchase from global corporations like Monsanto that have proven to be largely unsuitable for the indigenous agricultural conditions they are constrained to work within. Or perhaps it is not so surprising that the darker side of technological innovation and the streaming capitalism of the contemporary global economy is ignored by the these authors as their career track appear overly dependent on slavishly following the libertarian socio-economic ideologies spun by the techno-elites of Silicon Valley.'

1	'This is a strange book. There are only two full-page illustrations that look as though they were drawn by a ten-year-old. The pages are filled with text. I cant imagine a child sitting and listening to this for very long.\n\nThe descriptions of the jungle are flat and uninformative. The child will learn nothing new. All the animals are generic, such as frog, snake, monkey.\n\nThe verb tense switches back and forth from past to present throughout the story. The pace is slowed bya surfeit of words.\n\nUnfortunately, the book ends with an overused clich&eacute;. The child wakes up and it was all a dream.'

Book was dull, predictable, and way too long on the reasons for leaving behind what appeared to be a decent groom. The groom? Lacked character and charm- what was there to love? I guess that part got left in the dust, if not in the brief flashbacks.'
1	'I was very disappointed with this book. Very little suspense and little intrigue. I will not be reading any more of this series.'
2	"For some reason there's author choose to focus on the most mundane scenes in detail for way too long. I mean the whole scene on picking out a dress way completely unnecessary and way too long. Also, throws relationship was so cliche, it felt longer it was written by a 15 year old who watched Disney porn for the first time."

At the end you're given a link back to a free gift which you have to subscribe to the authors email list to get and its a pdf with just about the same info."

Glad it was available on Kindle Unlimited.'

1	"The big question I had after finishing the book was, Why on earth did I bother to finish it? I suppose I was hoping it would redeem itself. But alas, that never happened. This was the most self indulgent novel I have ever read.\n\nThe story was told from the vantage point of Lola's boyfriend, who doesn't speak English very well. That point was all too well made. The author's prose of 300+ pages of poor English grammar, profanity, racist remarks and long winded footnotes was simply too self-serving for my taste buds.\n\nThe original question I had, HOW DID THIS BOOK WIN THE PULITZER PRIZE? was answered on FAQ section [...].\n\nAnd here is the answer for all those who have asked the same question:\n\nQuestion #20. What are the criteria for the judging of The Pulitzer Prizes?\n\nAnswer: There are no set criteria for the judging of the Prizes."

They may be socially inept, but they are very, very smart. The characters here sound like adolescents in a Nancy Drew novel. It is so oft putting I couldn't read the book. A Cambridge PhD's in mathematic makes copies of a secret code that was in danger of being stolen. Yay! Puts one copy in the oven and another in a secret place. Yay! Are you kidding? I will continue to read this author's books but will make sure she is writing about normal people in average settings. Unless you are a middle schooler (and maybe not even then) keep away from this book."

2	"This little book is full of typos, omitted steps and just incomplete recipes. I'm so disappointed. There are a few basic recipes I might try, but I hesitate to waste the expensive ingredients in case they don't turn out. The writing and editing don't instill a lot of confidence!"

What I got was a horror story that was poorly written, obviously not spell checked, or grammar checked.  I was along for the ride until zombies started showing up and dead people came back to life.  That isn\'t historical fiction.  The book is a mess.  This is one to miss.  There, I believe I was not too harsh, and actually minimized it\'s "issues".'
1	"Perrow's book, Normal Accidents, is a classic in its field.  I purchased The Next Catastrophe assuming that it would be a worthy successor.  Boy, was I disappointed.  Instead of careful argumentation, Perrow gives political commentary, based on nothing more than his own biases and preconceived notions.  Normal Accidents was marred in a few places by clear political bias, but the overall analysis of the book was so well-done that overlooking those few places was easy.  This is not true of The Next Catastrophe, in which good analysis and argumentation is hard to find amidst the diatribe.  If you are interested in knowing about Perrow's political views, buy this book; otherwise, do not waste your money."

1	"I enjoy hard sci fi and this looked like it fitted the bill. And it was given high praise by Richard Dawkins, whose work I enjoy immensely. However...this is by far the worst sci fi novel I have read. It reads as if it was written at one sitting with no thought to developing any tension or character development. Passages where millions die are treated no differently to those where a couple of scientists think about having another cup of coffee.\n\nTake some passages out of context and you could be persuaded that they might be the outline for some comic sketch on corny 50's sci fi. Maybe by Harry Enfield.\n\nI read it all the way through for the same reason that you can't stop watching really bad films. You keep thinking that it can't get any worse. It didn't, but that just tells you how bad it started off in the first instance."

1	"Im going to come right out with a positive on this, mostly to ease my guilt for what Im going to say later, but still this should be a TV show. I know it has a few sequels, and presumably they follow the same gigantic cast of cardboard cut-outs that are wandering around Niceville looking for the same plot that readers are, but are only stumbling through badly written RPG side quests. Nevertheless, with a good director and some good actors, this could be a soapy syfi original series that is intended to go nowhere for forever.\n\nI picked this book up because Stephen King said some nice things about it, and I mostly like Stephens books. Im not going to come out and say hes wrong in his opinion of this, or of the other readers out there that have liked it, but I thought this was borderline unfinishable and I don't think Ive unfinished a book that was actually bound in paper and published by a real publisher ever. So typically I try to enjoy books at the level they are intended. I don't read YA novels looking for Hemingway, and I don't read Proust looking for Dan Brown (I don't read Dan Brown, that was just an example). So when I tell you I thought Niceville was amazingly bad, Im comparing it to other books around its level: books that are page turning escape novels. This novel has no central plot. It has a mishmash of subplots that all weave together into a minimally fleshed out idea. Perhaps this could have been pulled off with a handful of standout characters, but the characters are nothing but silly exotic names and superfluously detailed physical descriptions. So much time is spent on lineage, nose shape, hairline, clothes, boot color, why boots are the way to go, teeth grinding, crazy three part names, and personality descriptions and yet no time is spent on having the characters be actual different people. They all come across as differently clothed versions of the same person. I can almost image someone reading an early draft and telling Carson Stroud, why don't you give them all crazy names and descriptions so we can tell whos who. Well, at least its well written for a satire!! If this were the Scary Movie version of hard boiled, it would be hilarious, but no, I think we are supposed to be taking this seriously. Maybe I should question myself here are we supposed to be taking this seriously? To use literally in its literal sense (which Carson mostly doesnt), I literally slapped my head and rolled my eyes while reading. I haven't done that since I imagined myself reading Fifty Shades of Grey!\n\nSadly, there are some cool ideas here, but theyve been covered to a lesser extent in Twin Peaks and Fargo. A good TV treatment  could back away from the derivative hard boiled stylizations bordering on camp, or hell, maybe just run with them and make the show a goofy comedy (maybe the book is a goofy comedy and I just totally didn't get it). Oh well, sorry Steve; I read On Writing and should write better sentences than that last one. And sorry for the bad review. Fortunately for everyone who thinks Im totally wrong, you're opinion carries a bit further than my own."

And the fact that the hero actually called himself "f--ing sexy" and pointed out several times how women always want to sleep with him was kind of weird.\n\nAnd the big twist at the end? Like what was that? I\'ve read some pretty outlandish scenarios, but this one took a lot of suspension of actual thought. I don\'t know, I\'m not explaining that too well. But that\'s just what I\'m thinking after I read this jumbled book.\n\nSo I actually commend people who write because I\'m crap at it. However, this book just was not for me.'

2	"I hated to have to give this book a low rating, afterall, some may find this bool helpful, but there's really something that rubbed me the wrong way andd, I think newer and more helpful information is available regarding PMDD.\n\nI preface my review by saying that I did not read the entire book (I returned it midway through), so it's possible I missed information, but based on what I read so far...\n\nAt the beginning of the book, one of the authors lists her credentials, most of which are for the big pharma industry. Moving forward in reading this book, I knew I was going to find subtle information potentially promoting use of medication.\n\nAs promised, within the first few chapters, antidepressants are being recommended.  While it's true that antidepressants have proved successful in some cases, I'd venture to argue the statistics have changed since the release of this book. Some people rely on birth control to stop their menstruation, which has been proven successful, but (and I could be wrong) didn't receive as much attention in the book.\n\nEither way, we live in a country that recommends medicine like candy, and this book fails to point out that with these medications can come a new onslaught of side effects. The book does not give adequate focus to the research regarding successful naturopathic and homeopathic interventions. Perhaps that research doesn't exist, or, perhaps it's being ignored. (Although to their credit, exercise is discussed)\n\nI will give the book credit for providing information on the physiology of the disorder,  but again, since the release of the book I have read more precise information for free on the Internet."
2	'This is my first Hell Hath no Fury, and I started with the 3rd one.  It\'s flat - not much substance and the spelling is atrocious.  For example, the first story of "evil from down under", and the first sentence as Author\'s note:  "We often HERE about the bad childhoods, etc."  HERE and HEAR have two meanings, and I know that the Author meant HEAR.  Anyway, it\'s pretty much downhill from there.'
2	"I was barely able to finish this book due to author's poor sentence structure, pacing, and the atrocious dialogue.  It reads like an elementary school student's first attempt at writing a story.

You won't regret it."

1	"Boring story. Weak, one-note characters & clunky, unbelievable dialogue...don't waste your time. I had to give up when I realized it wasn't getting better. Needs a lot of work. I never want to be mean in my reviews, and I am trying not to be mean here, but this writer should keep working on her craft and get a lot of constructive criticism from skilled and experienced writers. Also, read some good fiction, listen to the people around you talk, and try to write like that rather than this. People who know each other don't say each other's names every other sentence, for example."

I LOVE Harry Potter books; I read the whole series at least once a month, but I can\'t read books with characters like Severus Smape or Drano Malfoy.

It almost ruined the whole world of Harry Potter for me except for after 41% of this "story" I had the good sense to stop.'

I don\'t think it ever saw an editor, let alone a spell-checker. Plus the writing was completely juvenile, the hero was an ass, and the heroine was TSTL, as the previous reviewer said.

1	"This is an easy to read book. I almost gave up on it but have a hard time doing so. I wish I did. I did not like the end at all. It was an easy read about three girls meeting at the right point in their lives to just so happen to hit it off, become BFF's and help and save each other all within weeks of meeting.  SPOILER- At the end the ex kidnaps the spouse and then when she is saved by her new BFF's (surprise) she comes tattered and torn from the closet saying she had been raped. I think this is not an easy topic and it seemed like it was thrown in as an after thought and then not discussed again. The aftermath of what she went through was never reviewed. The book ends quickly after with the girls each getting their happy ending."

2	"As I have enjoyed the first two books in this series, I was looking forward to and set on enjoying this book as well. Alas, I did not enjoy it at all. It went on far too long and I found myself wanting to jump ahead at several points in the process. While I enjoy what the author was trying to do, (build up the story with William,) at least a good one third to two thirds of it could have been chopped. Those parts added nothing to the story at all. It felt like it was the same story, second verse. The author could have cut all those repeating stories out and focused on the challenge, but because of all this extra filler, the plot got bogged down and I lost the thread several times. Also, the book I read had a lot of typos and grammatical errors. These don't normally bother me, but by the way the book was written, the dialog used, it was frustrating and confusing at times.\n\nOnce the real plot of the story started to shine through it became much more enjoyable. I read this book, because I don't like to read books out of order, and I have three or more books in this series that I have that I want to read. Thankfully, those books are about less than a half the length of this one. I think if I didn't have those books waiting for me, I would not have finished this book, and thats a real shame, because Hilda is an awesome wicked witch, and William is a good character to explore."
2	"As a longtime King fan, I personally felt this story wasn't worth the 3 bucks they charged for it.  The villian is like a combination of villians King has used to far better effect in some of his other novels.  The characters are compelling as usual but are given far too little print space to really develop.  Worse still, 20% of the kindle pages are just a teaser for King's upcoming novel.  My advice: save your $3 and wait for it to come out in a collection.  It is not a worthy read as a standalone story."

2	'Collection of recipes, tidbits of information, and preaching. The title is almost longer than the rest of the book!\n\nI borrowed this book through the Kindle Owners\' Lending Library. I think there might be some useful ideas in this book, but between confusing (and probably unedited) writing and flat-out wrong directions, anything useful is lost. "Substitute that boring mayonnaise and mustard ..." I don\'t find them boring but in any case, she presumably meant "replace" rather than "substitute." "Through these pages I\'m going to teach you how to make." Make what? "Switch out that boring white bread with multi-grain or whole-grain bread that is mouthwatering just by looking at them." More power to her if she finds whole-grain breads mouthwatering, but I don\'t, and I also don\'t like sentences that don\'t make sense. "Throw in a little meat on top of your favorite vegetable selection is always a great substitute for store bought lunch." The idea is nice if you can pull it out of the sloppy writing. "The health benefits of Gouda take room from raw milk." First, this makes no sense, and second, Wiki does not indicate that Gouda is a raw-milk cheese.\n\nBuchanan\'s stated goal is to promote healthy eating rather than weight loss, but her title contradicts her stated goal, and I personally don\'t lose weight if I eat foods like baked potatoes with blue cheese on them! Most of her recipes call for a LOT of salt: 1 tsp for 2 cups almonds in "Sweet and spicy nuts," and 2 TABLESPOONS for 1-3/4 cups almonds in "Spanish Tapas Medley," for example. She praises nuts, which admittedly offer a lot of nutritional benefit but are also relatively high-calorie and high-fat. I was afraid to figure the calories in "Panko-Crusted Fish Sticks With Not-So-Ordinary Katchup" - commercial catsup AND commercial barbecue sauce? Although using a lot of non-processed ingredients, Buchanan\'s recipes occasionally call for reduced-fat items, which generally include more carbohydrates - not really a healthy or calorie-smart tradeoff.\n\nFinally, the recipes themselves frequently contain directions that are incomplete or flat-out wrong. I\'m pretty sure Buchanan meant 2 teaspoons rather than 2 tablespoons salt in the "Spanish Tapas Medley" because 2 tablespoons would produce an inedible mess. I wouldn\'t think relish and blue cheese dressing would make a good tuna salad, and I definitely wouldn\'t want to put it on "a piece of multi grain brain." (I didn\'t make that up, honest. My Kindle shows 11% on that page.) "Smoked Salmon and Wild Rice Parcels" call for "1 cup wild rice" but does not specify whether it should be cooked or uncooked - quite a difference! The ingredients list for "Gouda Cheese, Chicken Breasts and Grape Skewers" calls for cubed Gouda, but the directions refer to a "mozzarella ball." "Grilled Turkey Pot Stickers" calls for cooking in in 1 tablespoon oil and 1/2 cup water "until both sides are golden brown, about 1 minute per side." Cooking food (generally sausage) in a mixture of fat and water is a legitimate technique; the food cooks as the water evaporates and then acquires a nice golden brown color by cooking in the oil after the water is gone. But it takes FAR longer than 1 minute to achieve! "Panko-Crusted Fish Sticks With Not-So-Ordinary Katchup" use fish fillets and lack any directions on turning the fillets into fish sticks.\n\nBuchanan actually does have some good ideas buried here; the "Grilled Turkey Pot Stickers" sound especially appealing. But it would require a tough editor to turn this mess into a helpful product.'

Full of stereotypes, no-depth characters and horrible cliches, particularly during romance scenes, made what could\'ve been a sweet romantic story into something not worth reading. The Cos-Play angle was over the top, as was the emphasis on race. The whole "say it out loud / louder so I can get a recording of consent, without telling you that I\'m recording it" was weird to say the least.'

2	"'Doctor Who: The Bog Warrior' is part of the Time Trips series and finds the Tenth Doctor on the planet Cashel. It's a novella length story with princesses and Bog people.

The union is important in order to stop a war among two different groups of people. When Ash is forced to flee the ball, she leaves behind a shoe which the Tenth Doctor retrieves. It's at this point in the story when you realize that this story is a court intrigue story with the Cinderella story at the heart.\n\nIt's not that weaving fairy tales into Doctor Who can't work. I think the problem is there weren't many characters I cared about. Sure, the Bog People have a plight and it would seem tragic, but I just found myself reading it to finish it. I have a hard time recommending this to any but the die hard collect everything Doctor Who fan.\n\nI was given a review copy of this ebook by Random House UK, Ebury Publishing, and Netgalley in exchage for an honest review.

1	'The book is very dry and boring.  It is written in the fashion of a army field manual.  If your starting your own military K-9 program I would buy it.'
1	'I am very disappointed.  On the first page I am informed that this is not the correct book and that I have to click a link to bring me to the "correct" download.  The link provided only gets me to a different e-reader download and not the book.  So, am I to understand that I have to wade through spelling/grammar errors, as well as disjointed pages, just because I do not wish to download an e-reader other than what I already have?  I am trying to muddle through this book as best as I can and have already lost interest.  Sad to say, if there is another book after this one, I will not be purchasing it.'
1	"I apologize to the author, but maybe he should know I can't read the book I supposedly downloaded. Maybe it's is the Cloud. Maybe it's in some Amazon-owned digital safe. I don't know where it is, and can't spend any more time looking for it."

1	'If I could give zero stars, I would.  If you want to read ramblings about drunk women and resultant hangovers . . . .waste your own time.  It annoys me to be suckered in by the false advertising that suggests that one might learn something about Japan from reading this book.  It annoys me more that young women think their drunken behavior so interesting that the rest of us want to read about it!  Get a grip ladies: Your behavior is not acceptable.'
2	"The story revolved around 4 people on a retreat in a creepy manor on the Kangaroo island in Australia. With sleek and dangerous men and an astrology Crazy retreat leader things get out of hand. The story starts lukewarm turning into cold water and getting a bit warm again towards the end. It definetly felt creepy and strange with the astrology stuff and the boring activities at the retreat. The chemistry though there between some of the characters fizzled out before I could conenct with them.\nWith all the astrology and weird happening I couldn't conenct with the story. Astrology definetly threw me off and there was a lot left desired in terms of the story, characters and the flow of the story."
2	'I have to agree with most of the other reviewers.  The first person narrative is kind of weird.  It did not add anything to the story and took away the ability to include events outside of the visibility of the main character.  it limited the ability add any depth to the story.\nthe main character was also not very believable.  He seems like a geeky 150 pound nerd, but decides to do heroic things on the spur of the moment.  There was no development of this side of his character, he just started doing things like being the one to go spy on the aliens.\nSpeaking of the aliens, not much developed there.  Are they machines or beings in suits?  Ar they just here to study the flora and fauna, which is implied, or to set the stage for something more sinister.  i assume that is to leave the door open for the follow on books.\nI must admit I am more of a space battle type but was hoping this would develop into something like that.  instead it is more of a camping trip that stumbles across aliens.\nI will not be pursuing the rest of the series.'
1	"uhh... so poorly written. Can't elaborate experiences without using repative words. Also, this is meant to be from the perspective of Christian... but it reads exactly the same as the first three books."
1	"The book had neither originality nor utility Sloppy editing with scattered grammatical errors added to the dissatisfaction Don't waste your money on this"

1	'Did not finish this book. Too tiresome'
1	'This book about a young lady named Jane who keeps trying to kill herself because she is obsessed with death. So she tries to kill herself again (saw that coming) and gets put on the psychiatric ward. Here is the funny part she only wants to be dead long enough for her heart to heal from the people she fell in love with who have dumped her. She does not want to be dead forever. What? Jane goes on about her life if she were a Langur monkey. The book really rambles on and on about nothing.'
1	'Fail! Anne has red hair. Whoever considered using this photograph has made th human race poorer and reduced the collective potential of the human race, we are all poorer for their existence. They deserve, and I volunteer to be the first, a slate broken over their head.'
1	'Definitely not for the low carb diet. Some recipes call for corneal, dry onion soup mix, and ranch dressing. These ingredients are not low in carbs. Some recipes can be tried if tweaked to fit low carb.'
2	'This is one of the most nondescript books I have ever read. You might as well study the picture on the cover because that\'s the only way you\'ll be able to visualize the characters. Gage is a tall cowboy. That\'s it. Kate is a beautiful woman. You fill in the blanks. Vagueness, character breaks, inconsistencies, logistical fallacies, stupid people, and errors a child would spot. SPOILER ALERT A loaded wagon travels to a remote, mountain wilderness cabin. Think about that for a moment. They don\'t have to use pack horses because there just happens to be a road that will take them all the way to their front door. Up the mountain. To a place so remote and rugged people ask how they survive way out there. Never mind that earlier in the book they had a carriage, not a wagon. Now imagine two swift horses trying to catch up to the loaded wagon as it lumbered up the mountain road. The wagon makes it before nightfall the same day even after a stop to rest the horses. The men on horseback can\'t catch up and don\'t make it until the following day. That\'s right. The remote mountain cabin is less than one day\'s travel by wagon. Apparently considerably longer by horseback. END SPOILER ALERT.  A person\'s name only needs to be used once in a paragraph to identify the subject. Especially when she is the only subject at the time. After a while, the same name being repeated over and over again became annoying to me. It felt like a Dick and Jane early reader. Kate, five, six, seven times in one paragraph. Some sentences ("I\'m very well, Landon. How have been keeping?"), are just plain off. Then there are the typical editing errors of missing words and wrong words. Lyell\'s side, instead of Lyell sighed, tone instead of town, etc.. I believe a book should earn its stars. For me, that means, one star = I wish I hadn\'t read it. Two stars = below average effort and/or talent (hope for improvement). Three stars = average (not bad, just not great). Four stars = above average (swimming with the big fish and fitting right in). Five stars = the best. What passionate authors strive for and readers remember more as an event than a story... It lives on long after you\'ve read the last word and is visited again and again just to relive the experience. I expect to get blasted with unhelpful votes and a few negative written responses. It won\'t be the first time. That\'s the cost of writing an honest review instead of a "let\'s help boost the sales" review. In my opinion, this is a two and a half star book.'
2	"This book does not bring any new information. I don't feel the author is a real expert in the topic. Sounds more like taking women magazine new year astrology section and put it in a book"
1	'I really enjoyed the 1st Dark Earth and was really looking forward to yet another installment.  I imagined a continuation of the first book of the series.  This was disappointingly not.  It barely hinted at the Dark Earth and goings on relating to the alternate dimension.\n\n"Voices" was extremely short and focused on a "bad" guy with a ghost in his mind.  It really had nothing to do with witches and powers or changelings.\n\nMaybe if it was not advertised as part of the Dark Earth I wouldn\'t have minded so.  It was a well written story, but just had no connection to make it worth reading as part of a series.\n\nWasn\'t worth the cost for sure.'
1	'poorlly writen plot disjointed'
1	"I agree with the statements of so many other reviewers.  The cover photo is offensive and demeaning to the integrity of anyone who plans to read Anne's story.  This edition should be pulled off the shelf permanetly.  The amazing character that L. M. Montgomery created is one that is timeless...a moving reflection of the experience of moving from childhood to adulthood...through all the insecurities that come with the journey.  Being self conscious, but then coming to love yourself as you are is a timeless lesson.  Recasting the image as a full-figured blonde teenager is unacceptable."
1	'In a word, this novella is just...awful. The story line had promise, based on the summary I was excited, but failed to deliver majorly. The characters are largely unrealistic and problems (that shouldn\'t have really been problems) are solved way too easy quick fixes if you know what I mean. Plus, this is a major for me, the whole "wolf world" Arend created was pretty far out there. I love shifter stories with a passion and I dig variances and different takes on the shifter world but Arend\'s idea that a mated male is okay with his mated female having sex with another man (to trigger his wolf) is just outrageous. It\'s at the level of saying vampire are really just misunderstood tooth fairies. Mess with the lore all you like but leave the mating idea alone, it\'s what usually draws readers in the first place. Do not bother with this book, it is a huge waste of money but also time.'
1	'Would not recommend. Measly 24 pages with little content and reads more like an outline for writing a book than any actual helpful book, certainly nothing substantial. Not worth the money and will be returning.'
1	"I don't like this book because the  main characters barely spent any time together. The main character is Candy? Then why do I see more Nina? It was a boring read."

2	'The previous books were fun, so I was looking forward to reading this latest installment. I barely recognized the characters.  The storyline was unbelievably bad.  Sorry, Shanora misses the mark on this one.'
2	'Nothing really stands out in this collection. I found myself skimming through parts in all three stories,mediocre,too much POV throughout.'
1	"It was easy reading, didn't need to read every day and would get more additional things going on, I liked it."
2	'The story line is imaginative; however, grammar, word use and sentence structure are poor. Use of quite instead of quiet, etc. hinders comprehension. There was an attempt to present the hero, Lou, as worldly, but he and Hillary talked to each other like adolescents in rut. Needs work.'
1	"Ok so cliches abound and even the heroine's dad is perfect in every way and a Dr. And she is amazing and perfect and the good Gargoyle is strong and good and the bad one is ugly and cruel.......\nGet it?\nSo after 1500 years this ancient King awakes. He steals a kids clothes and gets into a taxi, which takes him to the museum where both his arch nemesis and the heroine are. WHAT! Easy like that.\nJust skip it."

2	'I was unable to access this app.  I wanted it for my Kindle & was very disappointed.  I will try another one.'
1	"This was a really unlikely story. It involved a crime which should have been prosecuted. It involved a really impossible solution. The writing was sophomoric. Good gravy, I can't believe this author wrote the very respectable continuation of the Wolfe and Archie saga. Save your dollar!"

2	"Cassie had finally found a job teaching in a distant town, but the family she roomed with was austere and without kindness. When her grandmother died, she didn't know what to do. Finally she decided to finish out her school term and come back home to her grandmothers farm.\n\nEthan Bradshaw wanted a wife; a pastor needed a wife. Since there was a shortage of women in the West, he decided to follow the growing trend and send for a mail order bride. However, when she failed to show, he has to swallow his pride and dreams and regroup. Could his old classmate, Cassie, help with this?\n\nThis could have been a good story, but the execution left much to be desired. Most of it was just told and recounted. Even the blossoming romance was spoken about, and the reader got to experience very little of it. The book had no spark and ended up being ho-hum and without the tension that makes a story interesting. Neither do I think Ethan and Cassie would have been allowed to spend so much time alone together, especially in each others houses. In addition, the novella didn't seem to have been proofed. Stray letters would appear randomly in sentences. I was disappointed."
2	'This book was not as funny as I had been led to believe it to be. I am disappointed in the reviews others had posted. They must be so easily entertained. I do not recommend this book.'
2	'This book contained many grammar and spelling errors. His experience in heaven was amazing to read but only filled a few pages of the book.'
2	"I didn't love this.  I was looking for something new in the genre because I feel like I've read all of it and this was too clich and predictable for me.  the character development was non-existent.  Just didn't like it."
2	'Book too short.  Story has no point, ends poorly.  I feel I wasted my  money.  This is not a Lee Child book as I know them.'
1	"Four out of five times this book will put you to sleep. The best way to tell a good book is, do you laugh out loud? Do you smile read? Can you not put the book down? Do you cheer for the couple or tell everyone you know about the book? None of the above in this dictionary style book.  This book is an overly narrated version  heavily describing every meal eaten or cooked. Every step in making for example croissants.... there were more food description than people. The book should have ended at %35 but no, this author sends her to French cooking school...... It's difficult to like the main character, because she is not very bright, funny or witty, but man can she cry! I'm surprised the author didn't tell us how many steps she took as she walked. It annoyed me to finish this book!"

2	"If you know your basics, don't bother.  If you don't know where to start, maybe this is worth a read, just to get an idea of possibilities.  Be aware the book has few how to's and does little to explain the differences between easy plants and difficult ones."
1	"I tried to read the story, which might or might not be any good, but there is too too much explicit sex.  I couldn't even bypass it easily.  So I won't be even trying to read any more of this author's books.\n\nWhat ever happened to a good story being told without all of the sex?!"

1	'Never received'
2	'easy read and thought out in most areas. Some areas/topics seemed repetitive within a chapter but overall it was ok. I would recommend it as a quick read but not as a serious book on dating after divorce. Parts of the book were confusing - 5 reasons for something but 6 were listed. Grammar was off a little in several sections.'

1	'With all the references to video games,Harry Potter and movies about vampires I did not see it as an aid in creative journaling or creative thinking. It did not appear there was even an editor for this. book. It reads like it was written by someone in junior high. I like to journal. and have several-- travel,my life story for my grandchildren, and one to express my feelings. I was hoping this book would stimulate my creative juices but it sure failed. Needs an editor who knows grammer. English appears to be second language to author.'
1	"definitely not proofread. Wrong words. Nonsensical sentences. Misspelling. That drove me nuts. Then the story bounced around and was heard to follow. Several times they used the wrong name for the character. I don't normally review. But this book needs work."
1	"I thought I was purchasing the Kindle version of the actual book but what I got was a summary of the book. I have not read this issue as I'm still waiting for the actual book."
2	"Be aware, this is not a full length novel.  It's more like a longer short story.  It was all sugar and no spice.  Other than the circumstances of the character's former lives which are covered in the first two chapters, there is very little conflict or hardship.  What tension is encountered by the characters it Is quickly blown off and never developed.  There were many times I could see a new plot twist forming, only to be disappointed by the quick resolution the author chose instead.  This story had great potential but it was wasted.  The story is also fraught with numerous grammatical  and plot errors.  I probably won't waste my money on any more books by this author.  Too bad, I was looking forward to a great read."
2	"This is a pretty short shallow read. You might get off on it if that's what you're looking for, but if you're looking for a book that builds a good, deep romance through good writing, then this is not it."
1	'The narrative was stale and bugged me throughout the novella.  At first I thought I was reading the synopsis of the book because of how it was written, as if the author was giving brief descriptions. But no, imagine having an impassive by play of a sex encounter, if you don\'t believe me, read the clips below.\n\n"Overall, Amber is quite attractive, if young and a bit naive.  She\'s just budding into her adulthood, and so far, adulthood is suiting her quite well."\n\n"Dr. Jameson is probably in his late thirties or early forties.  Given that he\'s a well-established gynecologist and obstetrician, he\'s likely on the top end of that range, but he looks much younger, and carries himself with a particularly confident, youthful air."\n\nOn it\'s own, these individual excerpts may appear to be okay, but not if the tone and writing style is like this for the WHOLE book.'
2	"Rant warning!  I received the book free through one of the many sites that offer a few titles a day.  That being said, I have gone back and bought other titles to support a good author.  They do a leap of faith to offer the book, I reward that risk.  But to end a story in mid-thought feels like coercion and I won't go for it.\n\nSorry, Scott, I don't waste my time on previews and this was even worse because it wasn't labeled as such.  I do like series but this isn't fair and I feel so wronged that I don't care what happened."

2	"I've read many of Ms. Conn's books. This was a terrible version of a shades of gray style story. I understand the temptation to ride the coattails of a trend setter, but this was unnecessary in Ms. Conn's case and I wish I hadn't downloaded this book."
2	'This wasn\'t that bad...it just wasn\'t that good either. As a first novel, the writing was better than average, but the plot and other story elements were nothing new. You will probably enjoy this book if you have not read  that much fantasy; if you have, it will probably seem to drag on a bit.  This should probably have been published as a  YA paperback. You have to  force your disbelief down with both hands to accept that teenage Karigan  could have accomplished what she did.  I think it is a shame that  unpolished novels appear in hardcover while rare gems like Jane Lindskold\'s  "Changer" only come out in paperback.'
2	"I found nothing I didn't know in this book on training Dobermans. It could apply to any breed of dog."
2	"I purchases this book with PURSUED and SNOWBOUND. Because of the my lack of interest in the story lines, I haven't bothered to read HIDE."
2	'The review written indicated quite a few recipes but there were less than 50 recipes to the whole book. Calorie counts were off on one recipe that had meat in it. Listed 30 calories so I would say recipes were not proofed. Recipes not very imaginable. There was only two or three I will use.'
2	'Very dissapointing from Koontz.  Expensive short read.'
2	"I have this on my kindle and the updates are annoying and difficult to use. You'll see what looks like an interesting story on the update icon -- then good luck finding it."
1	'I read the first story in this book--which was how the group of women met in school.  Honestly, after reading the story I could have told you a little bit about the male characters, who got decent descriptions, but the females were pretty much described in one-word--"athletic" or "blonde" or . . . not enough, anyway, to make them memorable.  All events were narrated but with no scenes to recall--they travel to a horse farm, but what does it look like?  How\'s the sky?  Are there white fences?  I want a story that puts me in the middle of it--smelling the smells, feeling the texture of the furniture, whatever.  This book is simply a series of events reported as in a newspaper.  At the end, the author says they all knew each other from then on, including a person who wasn\'t even in the story, so why should I care about her?\n\n I didn\'t make it any further in the series--I couldn\'t think of a reason why I\'d want to.'
1	"I wouldn't really call this curriculum.  This was simply a nonfictional story book."

1	'It is a bunch of senseless, anti progress, liberal garbage.'
2	'Just too boring for me.  I gave up reading it after a while.'
1	"I read the reviews prior to buying the book and I wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt; I mean I thought,  how can a book have so much error that it would still be on the shelves?? I should have listened! There's so many errors in this book, some didn't even make sense! The explanations were vague. I would not recommend this to anyone! So disappointed!"
1	"I thought this book would give me some helpful information about how to advertise my business on facebook. It didn't give me any other information that I didn't already know."
2	'Lists of good ratings but underwhelmed by the writing and the super powers of the average photographer. Not my best purchase.'
1	'Do not buy this book on the kindle for educational purposes the kindle version does not provide Estimated Page Numbers. As in, even if the page number was available, that number is an estimate rather than formatting the device to fit the words onto a distinct page that the kindle version is based on. I understand that the mechanics of such could be  (and apparently appear to be) entirely difficult, there are websites such as JSTOR that aptly evaded such problems by simply adding the page number of the article within the text as for example: [404].\n So before trying to purchase the paper back hard copy of this actually fairly pleasant text, try looking on the college library website for a copy or for a free ebook version which I might add will have a scanned copy the pages with their numbers.'

1	"Grey is pretty far outside of what I normally read.  At the urging of friends a couple years ago, I attempted to read the Fifty Shades trilogy, but gave up partway through the first book.  When I worked in a bookstore, I decided to read up on the events of the trilogy because, well, there are some things you just need to know if you're going to work in a bookstore.  When I heard this novel was coming out, my fianc and I decided we would get it and read it aloud.  At best, maybe wed get the hype and enjoy an entertaining story.  At worst, wed chuckle the whole way through and enjoy some laughs together.  Though we were definitely entertained, we both closed the book with the opinion that Grey is the worst serious attempt at a novel either of us has read.  Spoilers follow.\n\nThe books story is pretty well known, but if on the off chance youve lived under a rock for the last 4-ish years, Ill give a rundown of the plot.  Christian Grey, successful business owner and billionaire, finds himself inexplicably falling for Anastasia Steele, a recent college grad with no dating experience.  What should be a simple matter of wooing the young woman is made complicated by Christians lifestyle.  Hes never had a normal relationship, but he has had plenty of submissives, something not uncommon in the BDSM lifestyle he enjoys.  Unfortunately, Ana isn't familiar with the role and, though shes willing to try, Christian worries that shell never make a good submissive.  Worse, as he attempts to make the relationship work, his long-buried insecurities tied to his rough childhood begin to resurfaceand it seems like Miss Steele is going to make him face all of them.\n\nIll start with a personal opinion.  I don't understand why people clamor for these stories from the guys point of view.  Part of the appeal of reading this sort of book is the mystery surrounding the romance interest.  How does he think?  What motivates him?  What makes him the way he is?  Id argue that a good author would be able to provide enough insight to the leading man that these questions would be answered.  But, ok, lets face it, there are a lot of not so great writers, so, sure, people want to know what the guy is thinking throughout the book.  The issue is that a lot of these authors don't have the skill to really dive into the males perspective to give a fresh look at the story.  You end up with a boring rehash of a plot youve already read, told through a character that is not only mishandled, but whose point of view effectively kills anything mysterious or intriguing about him because, again, the author doesnt know how to make this guy interesting on more than a surface level.  Thats ultimately the problem with Grey.\n\nId hazard a guess and say that most readers expect that this will be mostly the same story as Fifty Shades of Grey.  What they want is insight to this character that was so intriguing from Anas perspective.  Thats the point of the novel, so thats a reasonable expectation.  Unfortunately, the book fails to deliver.  Some things, like the dialogue and key events, are going to be locked in place because they were in the original book.  That would have been fine if James had used the time between those events to explore Christians life.  Instead, the book is an exercise in copy/pasting in the dialogue and events from Fifty Shades of Grey (both the contract and countless emails are printed in fulland as an aside, why don't these two text?) and filling the space in between with endless scenes of Christian working and thinking about Ana nonstop.  His inner workings are barely touched on.  I can almost forgive Ana being super obsessed with Christian; she had just graduated from college and was in a sort of liminal space between that and the next stage of life.  Christian, however, had a life well established before Ana came along.  Im assuming he had hobbies to occupy his time, people he sometimes interacted with (to be fair, we see Elliot a couple times, and Elena appears once), things he found interesting, and questions he enjoyed pondering.  But none of that is explored beyond a superficial level.  I feel bad for the people who waited for this book with genuine excitement.  They wanted to see how Christian Grey ticked, and instead they got a regurgitated story with Christian only thinking about how hot Ana is and how busy he is with work.  Theres nothing new to learn about him and being in his head really makes you realize how uninteresting he truly is (which, Im pretty sure, was not the intended outcome).\n\nIts not like there aren't opportunities to delve into who Christian is.  Therapy is mentioned on more than one occasion, but we only ever see one, half-assed session.  Christian will make jokes to himself about how his therapist would have a field day with this or that thought.  Well, James, if the therapist would enjoy helping Christian analyze some screwed up thought hes produced, don't you think the readers might find it interesting, too?  Or, Christian takes Ana to Ihop for breakfast and Christian briefly gives some background on why he chose that restaurant: his father used to take him and his siblings there as a special treat that his mother didn't know about.  Cool!  Thats getting there.  However, instead of giving the reader some memory of these happy moments (some of the few in his life) or maybe having him order a favourite dish from his childhood to share with his girlfriend, he orders something really generic for Ana (pancakes and bacon, I think) and immediately brushes the significance of the restaurant aside.  Or what about Elena?  Were told that she had a significant impact in his life, but we only get one short memory of his time with her.  Why did he stay with her for six years?  How did her introducing him to the BDSM subculture help him turn himself around?  How does he feel about the fact that she brought him into this lifestyle?  These are the types of things we should be getting that would help us better understand Christian, but its all glossed over!  What about his past subs?  His dislike of being touched?  How he became such a successful businessman?  None of it is mentioned, and thats what we want to see: stuff that wouldnt be shown from Anas point of view.  But James completely drops the ball and fails to deliver.\n\nPerhaps the biggest instance of this is that dark, troubled childhood that Christian claims to have.  See, Christian blames a lot of his actions and desires on his rough upbringing.  It must have been pretty bad to inspire his love of hitting around pretty brunette girls, right?  Surely well see the terrible events in their full form, right?  Nope.  The most we get of this are some pathetic dream sequences.  From this, we learn that he was neglected by his drug addicted mother, who turned to prostitution for drug money before she died of an overdose.  This all took place when he was, oh, four or five.  Then he got to go live with the perfect Grey family.  I get that the things a person experiences during their formative years can greatly affect their adult life, but this doesnt seem quite extreme enough to warrant all of the actions and drama that he blames on it.  I might have bought it had, say, the Greys rejected him or treated him as an outsider or if he experienced some sort of imposter syndrome, but that isn't the case.  Hes 27 or 28 by this book.  The ordeal with his mother happened over 20 years ago, and he got to live an ideal life afterward.  James, if you're going to give your protagonist a dark past in an attempt to characterize him, make sure its appropriately bad enough to explain what hes becomeor at least make him genuinely feel like it was traumatic enough to still be affecting him so long afterward.\n\nThe writing is awful.  I doubt anyone went into Grey expecting to be wowed by great prose, but the writing is so laughably bad that it deserves to be mentioned.  It can go from moronically simple and straightforward to pretentiously complex on the same page.  The repetition is torturous.  My fianc and I started a drinking game while reading since the same words and phrases were used over and over.  It made the book a lot more fun.  For example, every time Christian had a single swear word as a reaction, referred to his dick in an anthropomorphic manner, thought about having kinky sex with Ana at inappropriate times, referred to himself as Grey, thought Oh, what are you doing to me, Miss Steele? or referred to Ana as the delectable Miss Steele, I took a drink.  A lot of alcohol was consumed.\n\nIts also a bit odd that James chooses to focus on the things she explains in detail.  In the Acknowledgements section of the book, she thanks someone for explaining the controls of a helicopter and glider to her.  I thought this was a bit odd because, surely, that wouldnt play too large a role in the novel.  Jokes on me.  James chooses to give us a painful, almost step-by-step directional guide on how to take off in a helicopter and how to prep and fly a glider.  Hey, Jameswe don't care.  Most readers don't know how to fly these things, so theyll just skim over the details and get to what matters: what happens once the characters are in the air.  Sure, explaining this tells us that Christian knows how to fly it, but that could also be accomplished by, you know, just having him actually take off.  Another example would be Christians work activities.  If it was used to demonstrate that Christian is a workaholic, then it would be fine, but Christian doesnt even seem to be the brains of his company  his second in command, Ross, is the one who appears to really have it together (especially after Christian occupies his mind with Ana full time and begins to neglect his work).  Furthermore, after slogging through all those pages of Christian sitting at his computer, I still have no idea what Grey Enterprises actually does.  Details like these are mostly pointless.  Other random details ranging from bizarre name dropping of unimportant places to telling us exactly what song Christian is listening to at a given moment serve to bog the book down and provide little in the way of substantial characterization.  Where was the editor?\n\nAnother nod in the Acknowledgements is to someone that James claimed helped her with her Americanisms to keep the characters more authentic.  She needs to fire that person because these were the most British sounding Americans Ive read.  She has no grasp on how Americans speak.  An American, for example, would never say Ive nothing but meetings all day!  Additionally, James seems to have no idea what the Pacific Northwest is like culturally and she really had a field day when the characters went to Georgia and she got to use that overdone Southern stuff that pops up on TV all the time.  I don't understand why she didn't just set the book in England; then, at least, the Briticisms wouldnt have stood out quite so starkly.\n\nMost people will probably be drawn to this book for the romance.  Despite not being a lover of romance myself, I was curious to see this from Christians perspective.  Its easy to see why nave Ana would be attracted to handsome, mysterious Christian, but what draws Christian to seemingly ordinary Anastasia?  Thats the question I wanted answered.  Does he find her navet endearing?  Is her (supposed) intellect attractive to him?  Maybe she carries herself with a surprisingly dignified air that hes drawn to?  Or does he like that shes willing to voice her own wants?  Wouldnt any of those things make this romance seem much more dynamic?  All we get is that Christian thinks Ana is hot and likes to imagine himself doing things to her.  Thats it.  He never seems to like her for her personality (evidenced by how frustrated he gets when she dares to speak her mind to him) and only thinks about the physical element of the relationship.  If he wanted a sub, why not have Elena set him up with another sub?  Yes, I get it, Ana is supposed to be different and the relationship changes him, but we get no insight to that, no shown evidence that his views on love are evolving.  Instead, hes always lamenting that she isn't the perfect sub.  Also, I found myself not wanting Ana to stay with Christian.  The author can talk about how destined their love is all she wants, but all I saw from Christians perspective is selfishness.  Nothing he does is for Anas benefit.  Even when he tries to give her more, as she desires, he does it in the way that he wants: he buys her gifts even though shes told him she isn't comfortable with them, he takes her on expensive outings when shes expressed that shes happy with simple things, he gives her more vanilla sex when all she really wants is to talk and spend time togetherin short, he doesnt listen to her, which is an integral part of any happy relationship.  When she expresses concern at the presence of his staff or one of his (many) overreactions, he tells her to get used to it.  How is this healthy?  Why do I want this nice, sheltered young woman to end up with this control freak?\n\nThis book cant be discussed without touching on the sex.  For starters, its very BDSM-lite.  There are handcuffs, some spanking, ice play, a brief adventure with a riding crop, and some similar instruments, but as far as BDSM goes, its pretty vanilla.  What we get isn't even that scintillating, since its clear that James was going for quantity over quality when it comes to the sex scenes.  While the author occasionally manages to stumble across language that helps make the scene come alive, most of what we get is sterile, robotic, and repetitive.  Christian refers to Anas naughty bits in clinical terms, mechanically describes what hes doing, and then makes a point of thinking that it was erotic.  How stimulating.  Theres also an issue with Christians maturity when it comes to sex.  He may be experienced, but there are times Id have thought he was a teenager who had just discovered the concept of intercourse.  The number of times he refers to his dick as if it was a separate person (seriously, it hardens in agreement, greeting, anticipation, or just because it hears Anas voice) is laughable.  I think it might be the real star of the book.  Additionally, Christian thinks about sex constantly.  When he first meets Ana, she stumbles into his office and ends up on her hands and knees.  Christian immediately thinks of other things she could be doing on her knees.  In the same meeting, Ana blushes, and he wonders if her whole body would blush similarly if reddened by his cane.  He sees a desk?  He imagines having sex with Ana on it.  Hes riding an elevator?  He wonders if he and Ana will ever do the deed in it.  Its ridiculous that a guy this old still thinks like thatand it happens with almost everything he sees!  Its disappointing that a book toted as being primarily about sex is so, well, unsexy in its portrayal of the act.\n\nOn a side note, its concerning that Christian gets Ana drunk before going over the contract with her.  The BDSM subculture puts consent above everything else (Hell, I think even the contract specifies this), yet Christian purposely gives Ana too much wine because he thinks itll make her both more willing to voice any concerns she has and it might make her more willing to agree.  What the Hell?  This is a big thing for her, and she should be at her full wits before making that decision.  I also found myself becoming angry when, while going over the contract, Ana states that she isn't comfortable with some of the activities outlined, and rather than listen to her, Christian just tells her that theyll build up to it because he knows shell enjoy it eventually.  Or, alternatively, he thinks well, it wasn't a no! if shes unsure.  It wasn't a yes, either!  It all goes back to how he doesnt listen to her and doesnt care about what she wants unless it also benefits him.  Why are we supposed to care about this couple again?\n\nThe only character worth talking about is Christian, since Ana has the personality of a wet paper bag and no one else is ever around long enough to be characterized.  I don't know if Ive come across a more unintentionally unlikable main character.  In general, I love a flawed main character because that means theres room for growth, but with Christian, I think James genuinely thinks he comes off as sexy and intriguingbut instead, he seems like massive douchebag.  I don't usually throw this word around, but its so warranted in this case that I have to: hes a grade-A misogynist.  From what we see, he genuinely seems to hate women for no given reason.  I became plainly uncomfortable reading about how nasty he was to Olivia, how much he hated Kate for trying to protect Ana, how he seemed to think that his brother would only stay with Kate for the sex (even though its established that Kate is very intelligent), his caustic reactions to random women finding him attractive (this happens all the time)he really seems to hate women, save a select few, and I don't understand why.  Is this the authors way of showing us how devoted he is to Ana?  If so, it fails miserably.  The women he disdains have nothing in common, so I don't think its linked to anything in his past.  The only conclusion I can come up with is that Christian is a jerk.  Worse, since he doesnt develop into a better character, I can only conclude that this was unintentional on the authors part.\n\nFurthermore, James has no idea how to write this sort of character.  Christian often sounds a lot like a teenage girl with his insecurities, irrational jealousy (how dare Ana have other friendsespecially male fiends!), and the pep-talks he gives himself.  He wallows in self-pity and gets sulky when anyone upsets him.  He doesnt read like a dom at allin fact, he reads more like a sub.  A good writer could have portrayed this jerk as someone who was confident and in control, someone who acknowledged their abrasive personality, but knew when to keep it at bay.  EL James is not a good writer.  She wants us to believe that Christian is the big man with everything and everyone under control (which she tells us many times), but what we see is a whiney, spoiled man who sulks when he doesnt get his way.  Again, I pity fans who were excited for this: they wanted to read about this confident man with a hidden soft side, and instead they got a moody teenage girl with an excitable dick.\n\nGrey is everything that could be wrong with a noveland the author doesnt seem to care (its more money for minimal work, right?).  The nagging question I had when I finished was: What is this book trying to be?  Sometimes it tries to be a sex book, but the risqu scenes are repetitive and fail to hold any sensuality.  Other times it seems like its trying to be a romance, but the characters lack sufficient chemistry and Christians emotions are never portrayed well enough for me to understand why I want this tumultuous relationship to survive.  A good romance novel needs characters that sizzle, figures that simply must overcome their obstacles and stay together no matter what because they bring out the best in one another.  Thats strikingly absent here.  There are also times where the novel tries to be more of a character study, showing how an individuals neglectful upbringing can leave them as a damaged adult, but that aspect is never fully explored and what little we do see of Christians past doesnt seem quite severe enough to explain his current state.  Grey both takes itself too seriously yet never fully commits to a concept seriously enough.  It gets one star from me; it's entertaining, but for all the wrong reasons."

2	'Spoiler Alert......\nThis was the only one of the stories I have not liked. Really...the Heroine pulls a gun out, points at a man\'s chest and considers murdering him within 5 minutes of meeting him.  A person who has shown her no aggression. "If the stranger said anything to hurt her daughter feelings she\'d leave his body to rot, right there in the middle of the road." The writer\'s words for a man who has been nothing but kind. Yuk, really puts you off the woman. Just did not like the story or calling animals critters, like some old 50\'s western.  Too bad because Duncan seemed like a great guy.  Just wait for the next one......'
1	"The author writes a lot, but doesn't really convey anything. This ebook is geared towards people that are in the same exact position as the author, not for the general masses."
2	'Alistair Maclean was one of the best thriller writers of his time, and many of his books where set on ships and the sea. In theory, collecting four of Maclean\'s "sea thrillers" sounds like a great idea. And if they had included four of his best examples, I would highly recommend this. But just like \'Six Complete Novels\', they seem to have assembled this collection completely at random. So rather than getting "the best of the best", we\'re served up only one of Maclean\'s strongest books, and three very ordinary ones.\n\n\'The Golden Rendezvous\' is the only book from Maclean\'s golden era of the 50s and 60s. Needless to say, is an outstanding thriller and a perfect example of the genre. Combining two of Maclean\'s key tropes, the whodunnit mystery and man-versus-the-environment action, the book revolves around the attempted hijacking of a luxury cruise ship. What is the motive for the hijacking, who is responsible, and how can the crew prevent it? This book alone shows how great Maclean was, which makes the other three books a disappointing letdown.\n\n\'Santorini\', Maclean\'s final book, is also his absolute worst. The contrast with \'The Golden Rendezvous\' is so striking, you\'d swear it was a different author. There is no action at all.....in fact, there is not much of anything. The plot makes no sense and goes nowhere, the dialgoue is stiff, the characters are cardboard thin, and the writing is just plain lazy. There is no excuse for including this in any Maclean collection.\n\n\'San Andreas\' is an okay wartime naval thriller, involving sabotage and enemy attacks on a hospital ship, that has an excellent start but slowly dissolves into mediocrity. Its presence here only serves to ask why \'HMS Ulysees\', Maclean\'s first book and a classic of naval fiction, was not included instead.\n\nLikewise, \'Seawitch\' is just okay at best, involving an attempt to defeat a sabotage attack on an oil rig. While nowhere near as bad as \'Santorini\', it\'s still far from Maclean\'s best, with fairly weak characters and an overblown plot. Once again, Maclean published a far better oil-rig based book early in his career, \'Fear Is The Key\'.\n\nSo in all, we have one great book, two just-okay, and one dead set shocker. There is no excuse for such a lame collection, when Maclean published better sea-focussed thrillers that could have been included instead. \'When Eight Bells Toll\', or even something like \'South By Java Head\' are far more worthy than three of the stories included here.\n\nReally, you\'re just better off buying \'The Golden Rendezvous\' on its own, and sticking to Maclean\'s earlier books. Leave this on the shelf.'
1	'I first picked up this title because of the cover art of a beautiful Chinese woman with thigh length hair and a shapely figure. I am partial to woman with very long hair so thought i would give it a try. Unfortunately the artwork was so bad that at first I could not tell that there was a woman on a bed in the beginning of the book, I went through several pages until i could actually see that it was a woman. The art was just not to my taste. The fact that when you open it in your Kindle the pictures appear sideways does not help either, especially when you turn your device sideways to read it better and the screen splits the page leaving a white gap between the panel of art. Unless the art improves i will pass on this author. Your mileage may vary.'
2	'I thought this book was going to be a scientific book not a novel.  So I was disappointed in that. Otherwise it was extremely farfetched.  I had trouble accepting the premise that the dna could change someone so entirely.'
1	"Meh. The grammar and broken English really bothered me. Made it difficultfor me to read. I'very been a webcam model for a year now and found theach advice in this book to be very basic, it may be helpfulfor beginners, but your viewers are all so different that you really can't say how to be a certain way. Everyone likes something different. It's completely subjective. The part about ALWAYS having a matching mani/pedi is one example. She seemed to stress the importance of that a lot, and it's true that you need to be well groomed and look nice but it's also about your personality and giving people the feeling that you care and are genuinely interested in what they want/have to say."
2	'I halfheartedly read the manifesto. It was obviously written by learned, intelligent people who  had given much thought to their proposed way of life for the non-elite. . Beyond that, everything they touted was half-assed then the same as as it is right now.'
1	"I didn't like this book because  it ha about 10 page's in it. I think people in kindergarten should read this book."
2	'You\'ve read that story so many times before: the ultra-rich man meets the heroine, thinks she\'s a gold digger, beds/uses her, later marries her, and later falls in love with her. That\'s pretty much the gist of this story. It\'s too generalized. There\'s a lack of depth to the characters, not just the story itself.\n\nThe male lead was an arrogant, conceited man. Just because he\'s been preyed upon by gold diggers in the past, he has the "right" to assume that the heroine is such a woman; thus, it is within his rights to "punish her" (or "teach her a lesson", as the book synopsis calls it) by using her and discarding her the next day. Of course, it\'s also within said rights to bully her into marrying him with the classic "I can use my money to take our baby away from you". In addition, the heroine herself could\'ve used much more backbone than the author credited her with.\n\nAll in all, I\'ve read this general storyline before from other authors who managed to make it worthwhile to read. I\'m just glad I didn\'t have to pay out of pocket to read this.'
1	'Sadly, I read this book when I couldn\'t sleep one night. It\'s point of view is inconsistent, as is its tempo. The dialog is implausible. "I can\'t believe he is such a creep," says one character, referencing a lunatic that ingratiated himself into the household, then attacked his girlfriend, attempted rape and then assaulted him. Reveals in the "mystery" are quickly contrived, with people blurting out crucial facts of the case with little provocation or, indeed, hesitance. Utterly irritating.'
2	'Have read all the books in this series and am very over the angsty novels. The characters act more like teenagers. The only thing that saves it is the writer - she writes well and keeps interest. Not sure an intelligent person in their twenties pretends to be their twin and goes on vacation with their sort of boyfriend even to save his feelings - seemed a ridiculous plot device.'
2	'Well written, but too dark for me.'
2	'Way too short for the money spent'
2	'This book would be a fun and very quick read. The author should be using this book as a free bait and switch, not charging .99 cents for it. However, I now know how to write a quick cheap book so I could make a little money on it!!!!!\n\nPlease let me know if this review was helpful. Thanks!'
2	'This story was lacking in romance.  It got down with the sex, but no real feelings were involved.  I think it moved a little too quickly without feelings.  The approach Anna and James took leading up to sex was like two fifteen year old kids.'
2	'Warning: cliffhanger! Frankly, I\'m getting fed up with authors only giving portions of a story and expecting readers to pay more for each portion of the story. I\'m at the point now where I won\'t even bother reading another book by an author who does that, no matter how good the first "portion" was. Trying to "tease" me into buying another section of the book by ending the first on a cliffhanger doesn\'t work for me. Sorry, but you\'ve lost any future sales from this reader. There are plenty of authors who will give me a complete book for the price, so I\'ll just buy their books from now on. Also, the writing was amateurish. Needs major editing.'
1	'Tried this on my Kindle, no photos, no search, no table of contents... worthless app.'
1	"I really tried to like this book. I thought the concept of it was funny and that it would be a quick read. I got about 1/8 of the way into the book and it did nothing but drag on and on. I kept reading in hopes that the little old grandma would make the story funny at some point but it didn't happen. I quit reading at about the 23% mark and removed it from my device."
2	'I must have been totally blind when I brought this book. It was terriable. I don\'t know how I missed these reviews!!!! I am really "Shaking My Head" This book was written so poorly that if it wasn\'t the grammatical errors it was the book going in too many directions.  I couldn\'t even tell you what this book was about. Thats how much I paid attention to what I was reading.  And to think I really paid $2.99 for this crap.  Ms. Rickey E you really need to get some help editing your books. Then you had the nerve to put email addresses in the story like someone was going to email you or the others.  I would probably read another book by this author but trust and believe I will not buy it! Read at your own risk but..............'
2	"I thought the story and ideas were pretty interesting but I just couldn't get behind any of the characters. Even the main character didn't have much of a personality, he just kind of did things and you were expected to infer personality from how the narrator described other people's interactions with him. Which leads in to the fact that much of the important plot points are narrated rather than shown through dialog. As much as i wanted to enjoy the book it felt more like a campfire story."
1	'I typically only write positive reviews, but I\'m breaking from the norm so no one else gets duped into buying this.  It\'s basically 15 pages of links.  I promise if you do a search for "list of internet marketing resources" or "internet marketing resource guide" you\'ll do much better.  I rarely fall for crappy products, but today I\'m the sucker.'
1	'Normally if I can t get interested  by the 5th chapter I will not continue with the book. Sad to say this was one of those times.'
2	'SAME cat image on a bunch of pages. This book is weird and boring, sorry author. Lacks a real book or comic potential.'
2	'Not at all what I expected. It was smaller than a Readers Digest. It was presented as a much more substantial book. Information was old school knowledge.'
1	'I agree with all the readers who did not become engaged with this novel because the characters are not compelling and the plot is disjointed and the reading tedious.  The Corrections is one of my favorite books.  Stick with satire, Mr. Franzen.  You do it very well.  I am taking my copy of Purity to the used bookstore; will not pass it along to friends as I cannot recommend it to anyone.  Reading about the Anabel character was excruciating.  The motivations of the characters is murky and unconvincing.  A complete waste of time.'

I thought it would be a fun thing for my Kindle while on holiday but the only thing that kept the pages turning was seeing just how more inept it could get. As a gay man I would be offended by the nasty, shallow characters that the book depicts except that they are so stereotypical and inconsistently drawn that disbelief is the only possible reaction. Not that the straight characters come out of it any better: Rose the dozey, wishywashy faghag is surely offensive to women (we\'re supposed to believe she is a bit of a babe but this has to go on trust as the description of her "look" sounds like a horrifying combination of Tori Amos and an explosion in a Laura Ashley factory),and don\'t even get me started on the Cock-er-nee lad who is in love with her....a more patronising take on Working Class English hasn\'t been seen since Dick Van Dyke as Bert in Mary Poppins (if Tracey had depicted, say, an Afro-Caribbean character\'s speech and syntax in such terms there would have been an outcry). The numerous typos only made me wonder if any proof reader or editor just couldn\'t be bothered to get through it. Namechecking every gay bar in Soho does not a credible landscape make, and I really found myself wondering who on earth thought this rubbish was worth publishing. Edmund White it ain\'t. I only put one star as the website doesn\'t let you post without a star rating. I hope the author has a day job.'
1	"The author's writing style is too naive.  The premise was good but  the narrative was shallow.  I thought the book was annoying and the ending too abrupt.

I suppose it's odd to say that a leisure activity is a waste of time, but this book was."

2	'Educational rather than stimulating.'
2	'I\'m not sure why I selected this novel.  Maybe it\'s my fascination with the Mormon church that overrode my good sense and made me pick this one even though I didn\'t find the first one in the series all that enjoyable.  Maybe I just hoped that this one would be better.  After about 100 pages I began to remember all the problems that I had with the first book and it didn\'t take me much longer that that to realize that the issues I had with The Bishop\'s Wife were all back,and sometimes even more prominent in this installment.\n\nI continue to find Linda Wallheim to be very annoying.  She\'s more annoying, nosy, self righteous, and judgmental than she was in the first book, and I didn\'t think that was possible.  This really isn\'t a mystery.  The storytelling is seriously flawed, and it\'s hard to find any characters that have been fully fleshed out and developed.  I found the entire story line to be nothing more than an effort to pander to a "ripped from the headlines" issue.  Linda\'s diatribes are didactic efforts at exploring gender issues in the church and are insulting to any reader looking for a good mystery instead of searching for social answers.\n\nReading this book made me angry, and it had nothing to do with the sensitive topics.  I hate to see "issue books" that are more concerned with exploring a social topic than telling a good story.  His Right Hand fails to do either very well and is not a recommend.'

I am NOT the author of this book and cannot support ANY of the ideas and concepts.  Why?  Because they are based on one person\'s interpretation of the Book of Revelation. The writing is atrocious, which the author admits, and the thinking is also in line with the level of intellectual engagement. PLEASE DO NOT CONFUSE THIS DANIEL SAMSON WITH THE DANIEL SAMSON OF "God and Evolution".  These are VERY different books by DIFFERENT AUTHORS.  I am the Daniel Samson author of God and Evolution.

Nothing about the character\'s motivations/emotions made any sense. I agree with the other reviewers that it seemed the author started with an outline and barely filled it in before moving on.\n\nThe heroine was silly and unbelievable; one minute she\'s standing up to her brutish husband, the other she\'s looking at him imploringly, begging him to love her. Really? The "hero" was angry and made his feelings quite clear about his distaste for her, but virtually overnight he realizes he loves and needs her. COME ON. I couldn\'t even finish this and won\'t read anything by the author again.'

She has not bothered to have more than a few days of food, forgotten to order firewood, and has smooth tires on her truck, even though there are snow tires stored in garage. Then she finds herself stranded when the snow dumps on her and the scavengers start to show up.  Her deceased husband did leave her a gun for protection.  And frankly Im surprised that Maeve did not shoot herself in the foot when she attempted to handled her gun.  She, and the author, are morons when it comes to handling firearms.  Neither have any concept of what they are, they know gun goes bang and is real scary!  (And since when are "semi-automatic rifles illegal?")  When the lives of herself and her son are threatened, she drops the gun and her very young son has to kill the intruder.\nBut then, as in all :"chick books", a dashing hero rushes into her life to provide food, firewood, safe tires, and protection from the villains!  Then he goes on to single handed wipe out the bad guys in the town.'
2	'There were some books that were very erotic that I didn\'t realize were in there.  I wish the description mentioned the many "types" of romance that were included in the set.'
1	'I like all variety of romance and fiction but this one was all around a struggle to read. I had a hard time relating to any of the notable characters, the plot was kind of awful, and it otherwise did not meet my often generous and ambiguous expectations. On the plus, the editing was of a higher quality than I have come to expect from free reads.'
1	'Congratulations! It\'s a late entry in to the year for "badly written things," and while there are still a few days left before 2013 (or the apocalypse, if you\'re that type) I feel confident in granting this award! This IS the worst thing I\'ve read this year.\n\nActually it might be the worst thing I\'ve read since I was graced with the honor of editing middle school research papers as a teaching assistant a decade ago. What an accomplishment!\n\nThe good:\n(1) This book made me nostalgic for those middle school papers. It was like someone plucked the grammar and rambling from those fine, underdeveloped minds and put it right back on to my Kindle where I could have another go at it.\n(2) It is short! I mean, not for the amount of actual content in it (I feel reasonably confident that I could convey every meaningful message inside of this review if I so desired), but the number of pages was indeed low!\n(3) It was only a dollar!\n\nThe Bad:\n(1) There was a time in which I wondered if I had accidentally purchased a book about cliches. I popped back out to the menu to double check the title, and sure enough, this book was about shyness.\n(2) The research is very, very loose. It is clear that the author decided some things, and then found a study or two that more or less backed up what they wanted to say.\n(3) There is actually a substantial percentage of this book devoted to telling you to think happy thoughts. Oh and try not to think about those times you did/said something embarrassing in the past. Those will probably only make you more shy if you think about them.\n\nI am certain there are many wonderful books about social anxiety, but this one by John "Did I just read your MIIINNND!!?" Habel is not one of them. Seriously. That was somewhere around location 343 in the book. Save your dollar and put it toward a proper book. I feel I was tricked by a couple of good reviews and a low price.'
2	"Recipes are ok as a base. Pictures are NOT of the authors food, which I find disappointing. Just note that your food won't look like any of the pictures included so you won't be disappointed. I would rather have an authentic home photograph of  the finished product than an Internet copy-paste of someone else's creation (and certainly not Paleo). I'm not sold on her books for a couple of reasons now. The whole series is misrepresenting with inaccurate pictures, and I feel bad for the beginning Paleo cooks who believe their meals will look as advertised."
2	'I got about half way through this and found myself wondering why I was bothering. The characters irritated me and the action left something to be desired. Just not my style of book.'
1	'I am not satisfied and that was westing of money..I wish i can get my money back..'
2	'I found this lacking after reading one of his others first.'
2	'Disappointing from David Baldacci. I felt it was an inferior work and and his fame was used to sell it.'
2	'Reasonably well written and good photography. The author though believes he knows much more about the mechanics of a single action than he actually does. The work he describes having done is mostly useful if somewhat overpriced. I would take issue with the adjustment screw in the end of the arbor. Placing that screw there erases the taper that mates with the wedge and makes the only contact point the rounded end of the screw. Not good and a solution to a non existent problem. To the author. There is nothing the bolt ,no matter how fitted, can do to wear out the cam in fifty cycles. You were had for a little extra money.'
2	'what there was was good but`i expected an awful lot more pages. I got more or less the same kind of pages in the guidebook to go with the exhibition.\n\nThat there id infact not very many pages of the Lindisfanre gospels there.\n\nI found it quite disappointing and could have bought something had I known'
2	"I play an L90 Mage in WoW and have had a difficult time attempting to construct macros for those extended boss battles using other books on this subject.  No other instructions yielded a functional macro,\n\nTo be more concise, these other books published on the creation of macros provided 'mostly clear' instructions in macro creation; however all of the other books turned out to provide instructions for macros that either performed just the first part of the spell and stopped there (because the author had omitted the directions concerning Global Cooldown).\n\nThis book carefully details how to write a macro specifying how to use Global Cooldown to best effect!\nThe best thing is these directions ( for a Mage) are portable to other classes and races.\nI am very, very pleased with this book and give a high recommendation of it  to fellow WoW enthusiasts!"
2	'I purchased this to share and read with two year olds. It was neither visually appealing nor exciting to read. There are no extra words. Only the alphabet and dinosaur names. I do appreciate the pronunciations of the dinosaur names that were provided.'

1	'This is a worthless book.  There are 15 chapters, so I guess somewhere there is a "fact they don\'t want you to know" in each.  Three chapters are devoted to "barrel horse racing"--a very popular sport!!  Overall, the writing is grade school level.  Some of the statements are quite inane.  "From your perception, you will be able to tell the initial result of the race from looking at the place it will be held."  "When checking out horses, look for one that has winner written all over it."  The author devotes some space to online betting.  He claims that by using a computer" . . . you will know first-hand if the horse you are betting on will win or not."  Some statements are confusing at best:  "Ideally, a good bet is a horse whose last race was in the current season or at least 28 days ago."  I think the author means that the horse should have raced within 28 days of today\'s race, but what he writes is that the horse\'s last race should be more than 28 days ago.  Other statements are simply incorrect:  "A maiden race is a variety of this horse racing form which is participated by horses what have yet been untried in a race."  This poorly written and is simply incorrect.  A maiden race is for horses who have never won a race.  Some have never raced before, but many have raced many times without winning.  I cannot find a single "fact" in this book that "they" don\'t want you to know.'
1	'I completely disagree with all these 4 & 5-star reviews.  Not only are the reviews misleading, but so is the book description. This book was disenchanting and forgettable.\n\nIt\'s the story of a prostitute who\'s "retired" to become a Madam, then returns to prostitution to repay her father\'s gambling debts and to secure his release from his kidnappers.  I felt no compassion for the heroine and couldn\'t connect with either her or the hero in this book.  Other books with similar heroine\'s usually explain the reasons behind involvement in prostitution; in this book, she simply says she didn\'t have any other choice - that is just not good enough.\n\nShe repeatedly refers to her striking beauty and confidence which no man can resist, yet (1) we get no description of her; and (2) she\'s insecure through half the book. I also hated how she contradicted herself in every other sentence.  e.g."I had no idea where I was going, but I had an idea, and that was a start" - I get this sentence, but it\'s just painful to read.\n\nThen she becomes obsessed with a guy whom she finds "creepy" through 2/3 of the book, then all of sudden they\'re both insanely in love even though they know nothing about each other.  There is absolutely no basis for the instantaneous realization that they love each other. The guy acts like a jerk half the time, then becomes a dream catch.\n\nI pat myself on the back for being able to get through this book since I kept checking how far along I was about every 2 minutes or so.  I definitely will be skipping the rest of the series, I have absolutely no interest in knowing any more about these characters.'
1	'There were so many missed ways of writing good complete stories.  There should have been better proof reading and less errors'
1	"I know that the author was trying to write an erotic story but it was soooo...yuck. I don't like rape and that is what this is. I mean the things in this were not erotic. This was rape in every sense and that is hard to explain. And Amazon, I applaud you for not putting the next one on your site. Money isn't everything. I had to laugh at some of this. It was ridiculous. The only reason I gave it a star is because without it I could not review it."
2	'No, just no. The writing here is ok, but the story itself is terrible. I only finished this one because I paid for it,  and I skimmed.. a lot.\nAnd now the story continues with the other set of twins- where the woman was raped by her "mate" and almost killed by him. But I\'m sure it\'ll all work out in the end because she\'s pregnant and they\'re destined mates and she hates him but she wants him too- ugh!'
2	'I did not like this book  at all  I have decided that if I want inspiration I will get it from the LORD and not man,  So as you can tell sorry I got this book'
1	'I\'ve read books in the Dummies series in the past, so I expected this book to contain some useful information.\n\nAs written, however, I find it utterly useless.  The chapters of this book are composed of chapters from books of the Dummies series.  How can I make sense of a French for Dummies chapter from the middle of the book when I don\'t know what was contained in the initial chapters.\n\nIt was free (when I "bought" it), so I guess you get what you pay for, which in this case is just a crummy piece of marketing.  I deleted it from my Kindle and have no intention of ever looking at it again.  What a disappointment.'
1	'Awful writing. Awful characters. Just. No. I quit at 118 pages and will never get my time back.'
2	'Tough read.'
1	"I feel like I put up with all her crap and then got cheated out of the end of book serious conversation. She never tells him the reason she's a flake- which made her behavior some what excusable. Towards the end of it I thought he deserves what he gets and She is ridiculous! This is going in the no pile."
2	"Didn't read all of it -- It was more an interview and I didn't enjoy it.  Wasn't what I expected."
1	"If you like Scottish atmosphere this book boasts a  lot. There's a mystery but takes too long to develop. When you think its going to be solved, the author leaves you hanging. The secondary characters are more interesting than the protagonist. All in all, a frustrating story trying to milk it for more."
1	'I picked up this book free during an Amazon giveaway, and it still was a ripoff. The title is longer than the whole rest of the book! One "this page intentionally left blank" and one sentence telling the reader to "go do something." Go find something worth reading because this isn\'t, and I have no idea how anyone could award it more than 1 star.'
1	"Pornographic! Didn't finish book... Just picked book from best sellers. Learnt my lesson: next time read the reviews first before buying! M"
1	'Poorly written and hard to read. Very hard to follow this writers chain of thought. I would not recommend this book.'
2	'It was not a bad story idea but i thought it was really slow and did not read all of it so i can not give a complete review, was just too bored.'
2	'Hard to change to another section.'
2	'This book was interesting until the end. Then it seems to abruptly ended. So you want to know if this author does that in all books. The two I have read.'
2	'Trite, characters undeveloped and unexplained. Good plot and setting. Characters were cardboard cutouts and could have been fleshed out better'
2	"The pictures provided are useful, but there isn't enough supporting text/description to actually 'overhaul and repair' the Yashica Electro GX."

2	"The recipes actually sound really good.  But since I'm allergic to coconut and EVERY recipe has that as an ingredient, I'm not actually able to try any of them."
1	'I bought this book based on a recommendation. It reads like a 14 year old wrote it. Disjointed, horrible spelling and just plain weird. Not the Neanderthal fiction it was supposed to be.'
1	'poorly written. I found it to be very disappointing.'
2	'would like to read the rest, but not sure that I would spend money to do so.'
2	"I enjoyed the suspense/mystery aspect of this collection of stories but I did not think the sex was particularly well written. It felt like reading something a 14 year old boy would have written and was very male pleasure oriented. I prefer stories that are more women friendly. I think I'll stick to female erotica authors from now now."
1	'Where to start? Since I was not given the option to post a question about the book, I bought the Kindle version so I could see for myself if the recipes were in fact in line with the autoimmune protocol. And ... drum roll.. they are NOT. The fact that the book cover itself used a stock image with non-compliant foods was a red flag in and of itself. Allow me to detail my notes.\n\nOn the foods to avoid list {and there are many more if you want to be incredibly detailed like in The Paleo Approach, but let\'s just keep it fairly basic} this book misses some grains and pseudo-grains such as amaranth, kamut, teff, tricale, and wild rice.\n\nAs far as dairy goes the list was lacking, as if the Dylanna Press assumed the reader would know to eliminate the rest. But when someone is new to this kind of a diet and lifestyle change (especially if they are jumping in from a standard American diet!) I think it is best to cover all your bases, otherwise you\'re doing a great disservice to your reader. The following dairy foods were missing - and this is just off the top of my head:  whey, whey protein, condensed milk, buttermilk, casein, cream cheese, goat cheese, goat milk, kefir, powdered milk, cottage cheese, evaporated milk, frozen yogurt, sour cream, sheep milk, and whipped cream\n\nSince there are  over 2,000 plant species in the nightshade family, I won\'t go into all of those. But the following items should have been included in the nightshades list at the least: ashwagandha, wolf berries, ground cherries, garden huckleberry, pimentos, and chili powder. I\'ll throw in chipotle too, because I loved it so much.\n\nWhile this book notes to eliminate "Nuts and Seeds (all types) Oils" and goes on to list the oils to avoid, it doesn\'t list the seed-based or berry-spaced spices to avoid. A fairly common oversight as they were once considered a grey-area food, but such spices are currently considered a stage one reintroduction food on the AIP outlined by Sarah Ballantyne.\n\nThe book also fails to note to avoid emulsifiers, stabilizers, and thickeners such as guar gum, xantham gum, lecithin, carrageenan, and cellulose gum.\n\nOddly, kimchi is recommended as a fermented food to enjoy. Never mind the fact that most traditionally prepared kimchis are full of nightshades (white kimchi is an exception).\n\nThe reintroduction section of this book is abysmal, at best. Sarah Ballantyne breaks it down into four stages from foods that are least problematic to foods that tend to be the most problematic. There is no mention of these four stages, only outlining the publisher\'s recommended {again, inaccurate} "First foods to reintroduce", "Next foods to try", and "Foods to reintroduce last". Here are just a few faults found within the reintroduction section that are worth pointing out:\n* Legumes with edible pods (green beans, and green peas) aren\'t listed as a stage one reintroduction food\n* Fruit- and berry-based spices aren\'t listed aren\'t listed as a stage one reintroduction food\n* Ghee should be from grass-fed dairy\n* Nuts themselves are NOT a stage one reintroduction food\n* Seeds themselves are NOT a stage one reintroduction food\n* Egg whites are considered a stage two reintro food, but are listed in this post as "foods to reintroduce last"\n\nThe large majority of the reintro order is inaccurate. Since the reintroduction stage is one area of the AIP that is overwhelming to many, I urge anyone who purchased this book to ignore this section of the book entirely. There are other reliable reintro resources that are in line with Sarah Ballantyne\'s work, such as "Reintroducing Foods on the Paleo Autoimmune Protocol" by Eileen Laird of The Phoenix Helix (which is, ironically, one of the blogs this publisher links to in the back of the e-book).\n\nA few ingredients that caught my attention because they are not allowed in the initial elimination stage of the AIP:\n* Black pepper - This stage one reintroduction spice is included in 24 recipes.\n* Peas - This stage one reintroduction food is included in two recipes.\n* Dijon mustard - Mustard seed is a seed-based spice that is a stage one reintroduction food.\n* "1/2 pound sausage" - Most sausage I know has a number of spices - often just labeled "spices" on the ingredients list. Usually those spices include seed-based spices, sometimes paprika {a nightshade}, and at the very least black pepper. Suggesting ground pork and complementary compliant herbs and spices would be clearer.\n\nThere are a number of inconsistent choices for ingredient wording, and lacking specifics that could leave an AIP novice confused. A good example being "coriander" listed as an ingredient. I assume given the "salsa" recipe the publisher means coriander leaf, aka cilantro. Yet elsewhere in the cookbook they use the wording "cilantro" in three other recipes. Perhaps my favorite: "low sodium chicken broth" - why would the publisher even suggest this when there is a recipe for nourishing, gut healing, mineral-rich bone broth in the cookbook?\n\nAll of these incredible inconsistencies and oversights beg the questions: Did anyone edit this cookbook? Were these recipes haphazardly thrown together to make a quick buck at the expense of people on a healing journey? Are they plagiarized from Paleo recipe developers and bloggers?\n\nI will give Dylanna Press a thumbs up for at least noting that the AIP has a major focus on nutrient-dense foods like organ meat and briefly mentioning that this protocol also looks at the importance of lifestyle changes such as sleep and environmental toxins. Although since not one recipe includes those nutrient powerhouse organ meats and there are eight mentions of nonstick pans in the recipes -- I take that thumbs up back.\n\nThis book is NOT worth your time or money if you are truly wanting to follow the autoimmune protocol.

1	"I purchased this book thinking that it would help the study for the SLLA, but I turned out to be completely wrong. The book is simply a variety of information on how to study. The book does not at any point go into detial about the content covered on the test. I would not advise anyone to purchase this book. Seeing as how the SLLA is for graduate students I don't believe that it is necessary to purchase a book about how to study, by this point in your education a graduate student already has these skills. I ended up having to purchase another book from the ETS website and it was extremely helpful and what I was looking for (sample problems, example answers)."
1	'Boring.  I can usually finish one of these books in a day or two, but this one was so boring I had to force myself to read.\nI was distracted by all of the grammatical mistakes.\nI cannot imagine a proper British woman saying, "Me and him are going (..?wherever?..)\nThere were also numerous spelling errors and extraneous words that did not get removed.\nThe story line was not at all believable, and I am not even wasting your valuable time explaining why it wasn\'t.\nI won\'t be reading anything else by Julie Farrell, that is certain.'
1	'I have a weakness for light thrillers in this genre, the sort of books you read to help you go to sleep, or to take your mind off the discomfort and potential imminent death of flying. The standards for this type of book are not high, but this failed on every level. I only managed about a hundred pages before giving up. This book is so badly written and just generally stupid it may have permanently lowered my IQ.'
2	"Ok, first off I loved Lovello! I think this man is a bit of a pain in the backside but he is a rich powerful young and beautiful man. I loved how no matter what Axia did he was always trying to reach her and guide her. I'm also not sure how I felt about his religion being brought up so much. I felt like he was rather hypocritical in his actions.\n\nAxia was just a witch. She had no real reason to be the absolute idiot she was. She was supposed to be strong yet she was chicken, she ran and avoided and was just plain stupid for half the book. I'm not a quitter so I finished the book but felt like the drama was just too much from about half the book. I didn't ever connect with her until the very last chapter which was frustrating.\n\nTrevello was surprising to me other than hitting on the older ladies I liked how near the end he turns out to be the one person Axia could count on in her own messed up mind."

1	'This is by far the worst book I have read and I read three to five books each week. Many sentences did not make sense, such as "You should have stayed in the top of that more or better still back in Boston." Twice she said the gun was caulked, and four head instead of forehead. Other example are: Why instead of I, there instead of their, passed instead of past, needs instead of needed, shipped her feet into her shoes. Almost every page had some sort of error on it. It really deserves a minus on the stars.'

1	'I first heard of this book on NPR and thought it should be an interesting read, especially as I have grandchildren both in and approaching their adolescence. My enthusiasm, however, was but short lived. The author, in my view, is far too wordy, and actually sifting through all of that wordiness in an attempt to discover the point being asserted is, in my experience, difficult to impossible. One can only deal with so many adjectives, asides and parenthetical expressions before losing the point that he is attempting to  make. The author spent far too much time in telling the reader what he would deal with further on in the book and not enough time telling it in concise factual detail when he got there. He seem far more intrigued with his writing style than with offering succinct information. His definition of terms, as far as I am considered, was too vague so as to be difficult to recall when he finally leaned on them to provide examples. As a doctor and a scientist, who is use to reading for knowledge more than style, I would have appreciated more direct facts, un-flourished by voluminous words and asides. In the end, I felt that this book was akin to consuming empty calories.'

If I had paid for them rather than getting them through Kindle Unlimited, I might have been more inclined to give them one star. The relationships and character development were wooden and unconvincing. The mystery wasn't particularly suspenseful and the outcome left me with no professional respect for Duncan Dewar as an investigator. Benchley has clearly researched her Scottish setting, but this sometimes becomes a liability as she devotes too much time to describing details that aren't relevant to her plot."

Did not like the stilted language, and the continuity did not always give. Did not want to give it two stars, but one"
2	"This book started off great and was very well written with a story of a guy who was sick in bed on his Honeymoon spying on his wife by the pool from their room while she flirted a bit and they seemed like a nice well adjusted normal couple at first but the storyline really went off the rails after the action started happening. The main problem is the husband who was narrating the story seemed to not be willing to face the facts of what his new wife actually did. Basically he had already been sick and she left him without any discussion or prior agreement about it passed out on a beach at night alone while she went off and spent the night with another man ! I mean it was a completely ridiculous premise who would leave their new husband who had been sick in a potentially life threatening situation like that so they could go off with another man? I thought maybe their was some dark plot like she knew the guy from before or something but no she just went off as if it was the most normal decision in the world. To top it off she then lies to him the next day about meeting him to smooth things out but sends her new lover instead ! This girl has some nerve and the guy should have divorced her on the spot for that alone !  But the guy narrating the story simply ignores all this and forgives her she doesn't even explain her decisions and they just go on like nothing major has happened. He just act's like its a little bump in the road when in fact what he's got is Mt Everest on the road ! I mean forgetting the fact she cheated on him on their honeymoon without his permission she actually put his life in danger to do it !!! He is a very unrealistic and plain stupid character and he gets dumber and dumber as the book moves on and he's the one narrating the book ! After that the story goes off on really crazy tangents that are even more ridiculous. The storyline just had no credibility at all. I gave the book two stars because it is very well written and the storyline started off really well but just went plain stupid and got worse as it went. This is the first book I've read from this author and I'm not quite sure I'd read another one. I'm really very surprised as I thought that from the reviews of his other books he wrote quite serious and erotic stuff but this was just well written rubbish."
2	"I didn't care for this one, at all. I kind of liked the premise so I thought Id give it a try but it really didn't do it for me. The story was kind of choppy and there were times I had to go back and re-read sections to find out how we got where we were. I hated Matt, he was an entitled douche and did not improve until the last 10% of the book which was way too late in my opinion. I wanted to like Piper and at times I did but her relationship with Matt the douche made it seem like she didn't learn anything from her disastrous relationship with Stanley (the mega douche). I just didn't see how she could fall in love with Matt when I could find nothing loveable about him. Sure he was rich and he did nice things but he was also overbearing and was very clear on his ideas about relationships (VERY negative). This one just wasn't for me, sorry. I received an ARC of this book from the publisher through Net Galley in exchange for an honest review."
2	'The first book I tried to read twice and haven\'t got thru it yet. Way to old fashioned for me. The characters had nothing to draw me in or keep me interested. I hate heroines who are "yes I want him" "no I don\'t want him". Makes me want to slap them. Just not for me but the author is older as well. Don\'t think I would read any other books by her.'
1	'Thought this was an actual book, more like a brochure! Rip off at this price. Probably my fault for not reading the number of pages, but should not really be sold as an ebook'
2	"Not much imagination in the writing. not very descriptive either. I'm glad it was short book."
2	'Would have been better if some of the answers had not been incorrect. For example What king of England was executed in 1648? Answer King Charles I.This is wrong King Charles was executed 30th January 1649'

1	'I did not mean to order this and can not download on my android phone. No option to refund or cancel.'
1	"this was flat and felt juvenile. no imagery, no character development, stigmatizes mental illness by using it as everyone's reasoning for the antagonist's behavior, it was just messy. the way it progressed made it seem like only a four or five days tops had passed but then it says weeks had passed. I'm so disappointed that I wasted as much time as I did reading it."
2	"I hope this was one of Weston's poorer efforts.  It rambled to the point of fantasy and made little to no sense\nmost of the way through.  I read the whole thing and shame on me for not putting it down well before a half-baked ending."
2	"I don't like the idea of what you can do while in prison and the fact that they got away with it."
2	'If you love very possible conspiracy theory being rolled into one book with a somewhat humorous plot...this is for you. Atlantis, aliens, Nazis, 9/11, the Spanish flu, Roswell, and characters with to no development or complexity. Started reading... Finished because I was bored and wanted to see what other trope of conspiracy the author could throw in... Oh time travel there we go... Glad it was free with prime'
1	'Too short and not reasonable solutions to deal with a passive aggressive person. I do not recommend this book at all.'
1	"I didn't like this at all and I am sorry I spent my money on it.  I'm not sure what I expected, but this was just an autobiography written by a very dull man.  I guess I wanted to read what led him to learn to read and write at such a late time in his life and what that learning was like for him.  Very disappointing!"
1	'What an absolute waste of time and money.'
1	'I\'m not even sure where to start on this review. I read this book because someone recommended the authors page to up "LIKES" and came across her book.\n\n****SPOILERS****\n\nFirst of all, come on!! How many times am I going to read this story line. This love triangle would have been interested if it didn\'t seem unrealistic. As a reader, my mind is open to any story put out there. This book just seemed too fake.\n\nNow I\'m all for a bad boy going after a "good" girl, but you didn\'t really get behind this bad boy besides him screwing girls and doing drugs. You also get introduced to a character that this "good" girl has a friends with benefit relationship with and why?? I wasn\'t given any other information on him other than they had awesome, mind blowing sex.\n\nThen there\'s the best friend who is (duh) in love with the "good" girl. Again, we\'re given little information on him. He saved her from dying and now she\'s suddenly attached to him. This girl goes after the "bad" boy though and they get in the dumbest fight ever!! I\'m not kidding. I was reading and rolling my eyes at the same time. Then she finds out she\'s pregnant (after being told she couldn\'t hold a child) and decides to not tell the "bad" boy. Why, I have no idea. So here comes the best friend, ready to save the day and proposes to the "good" girl. Really??\n\n"Bad" boy eventually finds out and the best friend lets her go to be with him. I don\'t even think it was an hour after that, the "bad" boy proposes and they get married only to find out she\'s pregnant AGAIN. This time with twins. Are you effing kidding?? I was just over this book and can\'t even believe anyone would give this 5 stars. Sorry, the truth hurts, but I would not recommend this book to anyone.'
1	"Spoiler alert. i love survival - apocalyptic fiction. Disaster started out great and then the local riffraff attacked the two families who united  in their efforts to survive. That is when I found the story line annoying and down right unbelievable. At that point, the book turned from the survival genre into a sappy romance.\n\nWhat family man almost dies, sees his son killed, his wife and daughter raped and killed, and immediately after he escapes starts silly lusting after the surviving daughter of the dead family next door.\n\nThe Black family next door had some really strong characters and they deserved better treatment by the author.  The strong white women were just as smart and so how is it that dear old clueless dad of the corporate world makes it through and almost no one else.\n\nThis was the worst apocalyptic book I have ever read or I would have never written the review to warn folks not to waste their money. I was so let down when I finished that I was angry and I guess it showed. I like kick ass guys and gals, but dad was the typical doofus like those portrayed in TV land as stupid. The theme seemed to be - let others do your thinking and planning and someone will rescue you while the prepared are all killed off. Where is the justice? The sexual innuendo toward the end was not a moral factor to me, it just didn't ring true as believable because it was so juvenile. I felt that I had time traveled to junior high. I read 4-5 books a week and the fact that I still remember this one says a lot."
1	'The title of this book is misleading. There is not enough significant evidence presented in this book about how a ketogenic diet can benefits type 1 diabetes. Instead, the author has an anecdotal story about her Type 1 diabetic son eating Keto for a total of 6 DAYS and seeing positive effects, before he abandoned the diet.\nThe cancer-"curing" effects of the diet are equally mis-represented as fact, when there are simply 2 anecdotal stories about the author and her sister having gone into remission from cancers after eating keto.\nBesides the purely anecdotal stories, the author references scientific evidence from a scientific research in the 1920s which determined that a starvation diet was a suitable method for preventing health effects from type 1 diabetes. I later read contemporary analysis of these trials which suggests that the doctor in question used flawed research techniques to arrive at his conclusions, by ignoring evidence that didn\'t support his hypothesis. The author for some reason only focuses on the aspects of the research which supports her argument.\n\nAs someone with Type 1 I was disappointed with how misleading the title & synopsis of this book was, especially in relation to its coverage of diabetes & keto. To add salt to the wound, the book is peppered with spelling errors and poor grammar, which is excusable if the facts are correct and the content is valuable. Still waiting for a well-researched, evidence based analysis of type 1 diabetes and the keto diet.... this was not it.'
1	'I\'m sorry, did any of the other people here even read this book?\n\nGranted, really great idea, and a good opportunity to tie together some very brilliant things. Except that they don\'t. The book has nothing to do with "Alice in Wonderland" and doesn\'t tie the book in at all -- it\'s insulting to Mr. Carroll to claim that it does. There are also a host of grammatical errors (very unprofessional), and the book (if you can call it that) barely ties the ideas together without incorporating Lewis Carroll\'s work. Not to mention there\'s no support, scientifically or otherwise, for any of the claims being made.\n\nI agree with some of the basic concepts being put forward, but this type of work does damage to the argument because it\'s so poorly put together.\n\nI only gave it one star because I couldn\'t give it 0.'

2	'I thought the writing was choppy and hardly thought out. Half thoughts, almost juvenile in its syntax. The storyline was pretty good if you can over the writing. Where were the editors on this one.'
1	'I downloaded this book because it was free and sometimes I am pleasantly surprised and find a new author to enjoy. That was not the case this time.'
2	'I started it at least 3 times. Got about a third of the way through it but just couldn\'t stay interested.  I may go back and read it after finishing "A Wanted Man," hard to compete with Jack Reacher.'
2	"It was a choppy read for me with too much narration and not enough dialogue! I was hoping for a better storyline since there have been two TV series about vampire detectives.  For a vampire over 100 years, who had no clue about the nuances of human love, this could have been very interesting, but it was just boring and I won't continue this series."
2	"Not much to be said.  I read it but I wasn't so happy about the time I put into it."

1	'Not very practical for me. But others may enjoy it better. Way to plain and not something  Will use a lot.'
2	'I have to be honest and say that I did not finish the book.  I quit at 70%.  I was skipping a lot to get to this point.  In the beginning I did like Elise.  I liked the tomboy who trained horses and seemed to be different from the typical deb.  But, then, she just got annoying.  I have never been a fan of stories where the hero or the heroine fixates on a future spouse as a child.  I find it more than odd...maybe a little creepy.  That said, I have read a few that I have liked.  This is not one of them.  The hero, Michael, just didn\'t didn\'t work for me, either.  His "worries" about what his best friend might think of his romance with his sister seemed silly.  There were a lot of historical inaccuracies and the book really needed editing.  I could have ignored that had the book been less predictable.'
1	'The first book, Olivia, Mourning was wonderful. The second book was good. The third book? Awful. Not only did it fail to completely answer the question, "Whatever happened to Mourning Free?" it jumped way ahead in time to characters that are disconnected from the original characters, and thats the least of it. As a Michigander who group up in Detroit, I dig it when stories make references to real places or regional eccentricities, but in this book it seemed like the author was adding these references for the purpose of adding them without contributing to the story. Yeah, okay, I get it, Faygo, Bumpy Cake, and Sanders are uniquely Detroit but how many times can you talk about getting bumpy cake out of the freezer and adding Sanders fudge sauce while enjoying a cold glass of Faygo Rock-n-Rye before it just sounds desperate? It got weird. And THATS not even the worst of it  While the first book was decent historical fiction with a compelling story line, this book reeks of white savior complex. Oh my! What in the world would poor Charlie, the orphaned, inner-city black boy who steals food and has no role-models do without the amazing white, U-M educated Charlene who lives in a beautiful Dearborn home which she inherited from her prosperous and morally righteous white family? I think the story tried to examine race relations, but it came off as a pathetic attempt to sweeten stereotypes and a played out trope. With Sanders fudge sauce.'
2	"I wasn't even able to finish this book due to the poor writing, the repetitiveness and the lack of useful information.  This seems like it was either written by a high school student or poorly translated from another language.  If you are not sure if you have an overeating disorder, this may help you figure that out, but like me, I am sure most people who have this are aware of the signs and symptoms and are more looking to find a way to actually figure out how to STOP that behavior.  Unfortunately, this book is not the answer for that in any way.  I was disappointed and would not recommend this to anyone.  I received this book during a free promotion on Kindle in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. This is my own opinion of the product and yours may vary.

1	"When I purchased 3 Day Potty Training by Lora Jensen at the beginning of 2015, Jensen had a guaranteed refund policy on her website. If you followed her method, got mentoring and did not see results, she would refund the money. Although I am angry at the way in which Jensens method failed with my daughter, my biggest grievance is that Jensen promised me this guarantee, has since removed the guarantee from her website (I suspect many others have had trouble like I did), and will not response to my request for a refund. She simply stopped responding to my ticket.\n\nNow I will talk about the ways in which her method failed with my daughter. This method might work if you have a certain type of kid, but definitely not all kids.\n\n1.  We began 3 Day Potty Training when my daughter was 22 months old. Jensen claims that 22 months is a magic age when practically all children are ready for potty training, whether or not parents realize it. Yes, this is a gimmick. Despite the emphasis on positive rewards, potty training was a battle and failed. She simply wasn't ready.\n\n2.  Jensens offer to mentor you through the process is basically worthless. It usually takes her 24 hrs or more to respond (and when you're doing a 3 Day Method, that is a lot of time!). Further, none of her responses offered me any extra or clarifying advice  it was more or less what was already written in her ebook. I knew this, because I read her ebook MANY times in order to follow it meticulously.\n\n3.  Later, we tried Jensens method when my daughter was 2 . This time she WAS ready for daytime potty training. She responded well, until we got to night time. At night, Jensen insists you keep your child in underwear. NO DIAPERS, or else you risk sending mixed messages to your child. However, I have since learned that kids develop night-time bladder control at various rates in their early lives (some earlier, some later). My poor daughters bladder was not signaling her brain to wake her up when she had to pee, and therefore, she continuously wet the bed. This experience was TRAUMATIC for her. Suddenly, she was scared of the potty AND scared to go to sleep for fear of wetting the bed  no matter how I tried to console her. I wish this experience on no other parents or children.\n\n4. Jensens night time method for dealing with bedwetting consists of waking the child to pee an hour after putting them to bed, and an hour before they wake up. Again, this was a DISASTER! My child was angry when I woke her and took her to the bathroom. She arched her back and refused to go. Thus, the bedwetting and sleep nightmares continued.\n\nThankfully, I stopped following Jensens method as she instructed and have since modified it to work with my daughter. Basically, we use 1 diaper at night (and as many other potty training experts will attest, there was NO confusion!)  and we waited until she was actually READY. Just watch for signs of potty training readiness, and the process will go SO much smoother. My daughter learned to train in about a day with positivity and much less stress on us both.\n\nMeanwhile, Jensen stole from me a good portion of my time, my sanity, and $27. Please, don't let her do the same to you."

1	'i did not like this book it was pretty bad and it made no sense do not read this book even though it is free. i wishh i could put down zero stars'
2	'Interesting idea/plot. Poorly executed. I did not research author, but reads as if written by a very young person. Editing - numerous spelling and grammar errors, which most likely do not bother a lot of people.'
1	'Great, cleared up a lot of questions.  KO'
2	'Self centered, ignorant, so sure she is right when she is so wrong. Plus the obvious disdain of the author for the military makes this a dumb read. Only reason I will continue ( other than the fervent hope that Sarah dies a horrible death) is to see what happens when all gets turned on again by the pendant.'
2	'I thought that this was a okay story it would have been better if Marcus would have let Scarlet and Roane be together without having to challenge Roane for control of the pack. Roane just wanted to be a part of a pack again and to be with Scarlet.'

1	"I purchased this book for my daughter's college class.  There are no figures or tables displaying and they are absolutely necessary.  This was a waste of money.  How can they sell this as an Ebook and not give you the entire book?"
1	"A part of this book says 'What are some awesome examples of description?' and then gives a list that literally contains: 'awesome, exciting, [some other word], awesome.' Yes, that's the kind of book you're getting.\n\nIt tells you that 'believe it or not, many books make it to print with some grammar mistakes in them,' while making grammar mistakes the entire time. It uses the word 'exaction' as though that weren't a legal real estate term, but a synonym for 'exactitude.' It gives tips like 'before you start writing, think of things like: what happens in the story?'\n\nIf you think you would be helped in your writing by reading a book that could benefit from all the legitimate advice it gives actually being brought to bear on itself, in addition to giving incredibly banal or even silly advice, go for it.\n\nIt's not entirely pointless, but it's poorly executed and not a good exemplar of the skills you'll need as a writer."
1	"they are trying to sell Levive Juice and some stupid shaper suit.  I don't care if this works, what I don't like is the fact that they do not state it in their book description.  Be AWARE!!  If you do not want to pay for an infomercial, don't buy this book."
2	'Very elementary intro and background info that the average user learns in the first half hour of using the program. Nothing exciting or new here.'
1	'Teaser to the book. Not much substance.'
2	'It\'s better than nothing, but only just.  I don\'t want all the news, but the Kindle edition leaves way too much out.  It\'s just an ok paper to start with so I don\'t want to pay for a hardcopy or web subscription.  But still!  Half the space goes to obituaries and sports.  For instance, today, there\'s a short article about people\'s reactions to Trump\'s comments on the rioting in Charlottesville.  Nothing about the rioting itself has appeared in the kindle edition.  Similarly, the first article in the Kindle edition about the unrest at TESC last spring was an opinion column that opened with "as you may have read in this paper," and no I haven\'t! \'cause you haven\'t include it!  I had to go to Facebook to find out what the opinion column was talking about! what am I paying for here??\n\nIt\'s unfortunate because this ereader format could be great for things like newspaper subscriptions.  I don\'t want the paper piling up in my recycle bin, and I hate the websites with all their ads and being overpriced, so this seems like it would be the best option.  I don\'t understand why there\'s so little content.  Production costs have to be minimal.  but the one time I tried to contact the paper about a problem with the Kindle edition they didn\'t even know what that was, thought I meant the website.  Good grief.'

2	"Unfortunately this book didn't work for me.  I knew from reading the sample that this wasn't going to be the best book I ever read but since I liked the plot I decided to give it a try.  It started out ok, but half way through I realizes how ridiculous the story was.  I won't list everything I thought was wrong, but I will say neither main character was very likable. I'm not even sure why they liked each other, other than they both thought the other person was hot. There are just so many better books out there."
1	'This was very poorly written. It reminded me of something a 10 year old boy would write. Thankfully, it was extremely short.'
1	'Another rant by the enemy of The Lord Jesus Christ, Ruckman . Ruckman is the leader of the Bible Baptist Cult of Pensacola Florida and has been promothing the zionist/jesuitical doctrine of arminian pre-mil dispensationalism for years . He constantly attacks Biblical Christianity (Pauline Augustinian Calvinism) and leads so many gullible folk astray (like the 5 star reviewers of this book). Having once been a member of this Christ-dishonouring cult i speak from experience . He is also a KJVonlyist which is in itself a Cult . A simple google search will expose Ruckman in more depth for those who really care . For those seriously into a study i would add that all Baptists of any demonination belong to a man-made sect which is only around 400 years old . Baptists refuse Church entry to the infants of believing parents by refusing to baptise them .Only enemies of The Lord Jesus Christ would do this ( matthew 19:14 Mark 10:14 Like 18:16 ) In the New Testament , five ENTIRE households were baptised , yet Baptists refuse to admit that there was ONE child in any of them !!! With this false reasoning i wonder why baptists admit women to the Lords Supper as there is no explicit warrant to do so .'
2	"This book was frustrating. I liked the concept but so very, very many of the characters were unlikable that it simply wasn't a pleasant experience. Plus there were some places where I questioned the timeline (but didn't care enough to go back to verify or double-check). But again, I liked the premise and will hold out hope that the other books in the series are better."
1	"Poor writing, sophomoric one might say. Man of my high school students write better (and that is damning them with faint praise). The present tense that he writes in is especially annoying, and the dialogue is stilted and unnatural. It's hard to tell the accuracy of the history because the fiction is just bad."
1	'Aside from serving as a practice aid for a child learning to read, I do not recommend this book. The stories are a page and half long which provides no opportunity for any sort of story development. Halloween picture books for pre-K children offer more interesting plots.

1	'This book did not interest me at all.  Too depressing.  Not very believable.  Was not able to finish book.  Only read a few chapters.'

Anyone can throw in ad hominem attacks and use four letter words to emphasize their point.

If I had it to do over again, I would not buy this single.'

1	'The author of these booklets, the late Bishop Ken Untener of the Diocese of Saginaw, was one of the principal architects of the Culture of Dissent that infected the Church in America for so many decades last century. Whether the topic was the ordination of women or the Church\'s ban on contraception, +Untener never passed by a chance to kick sand on a Church teaching that offended the sensibilities of the secularized and radical left wing of the Catholic Church, now largely a spent force. With so many other choices available for Advent and Lent, e.g., Magnificat\'s "Companion" booklets, there is no reason to resurrect this relic from a thankfully bygone era.'

It is not, and contains little of his actual work. This is a crib notes of his writing and thus, a great disappointment vs. what I was looking for. But again, this was my mistake in not reading the accurate but less than fully disclosing description.\n\nAdditionally, any Kindle book costing anything let alone $6 needs basic linked table of contents, ideally via the "Go To" button for proper navigation. This has nothing and is all one lumped chapter of text. I\'d return it if I hadn\'t been a laggart and taken too long to view it closely after purchasing it.'

I never thought a book could be so easy,fast read and so boring same time. Did not bother to waste time on reading what was ten years ago,  though few pages were left to finish the book. That\'s how uninteresting was to me. And this is second book in series? So there must be first and probably, third and more. Not even interested to check out after this one.\nYes, just not my cup of tee, AT ALL! Sorry...'
2	"I lost interest and stopped reading at 40% of the book.  Their lives bore me.  I have moved on to another book.  I may come back to this story and skim through it to find out the outcome of their relationship but right now it's doing nothing for me.  No romance, no possessiveness, no climax to keep you going.  Both characters just seem too soft.  I started this series by reading Gio's story and I loved it, but none has compared since.  I'm not sure if I will continue this series."
2	"Originally, I didn't have any problems downloading issues, my problems were with content and video ads that started automatically. My problem with the app, now, is that I often get told purchase can't be verified when I try to download new issues. Or there are error messages regarding just opening a previously downloaded issue.  It just sucks. If I'd known it would be this difficult to use I wouldn't have bothered. Not worth the trouble, might as well just buy the paper magazine."

2	'I\'ll start by saying that the story in this trilogy is decent.  It doesn\'t stand out for originality, however.  The character, being a vengeance demon, at least has legitimate reason to be the typical sassy, brassy character that abounds in urban fantasy.  She does her share of depending on demon immortality, luck, and powerful boyfriend(s) for survival instead of brains, however.  This story has potential, and, with a decent editor, could become good.\n\nThere are numerous grammatical errors in the story.  A spell checker was obviously used, but often the wrong word was selected.  It would throw me out of the story every time since I had to stop for just a second to translate to the correct word.  Examples are "bare" instead of "bear", "affect" instead of "effect", "loose" instead of "lose".  These are the types of grammatical errors that should never make it into a published book once, much less dozens of times.'
2	'If you are trying to start a conversation with someone new, this book could be helpful. However, if you are hunting a way to talk to someone , about a parent dying, this book is no help at all.'
2	"Skip it. It's boring, bland and totally predictable."
2	'This was ok.'
1	'Some of my friends like Jane Austen, but I really don\'t understand why. I know she\'s an important part of literary history because she was the first writer to use third-person narration instead of writing novels in the form of letters or diary entries, but an innovative form does not make up for bad content. I don\'t think I dislike it because of the time period - I like Wuthering Heights and Jane Eyre. I don\'t think I dislike it because of the everyday activities of the characters - I like L. M. Montgomery, James Herriot, and Ray Bradbury\'s Dandelion Wine. It\'s just boring. Emma is a whiny rich girl whose problems are on the same level as Miley Cyrus getting the wrong car for her sixteenth birthday.\n\nEmma is the only JA book I have made it all the way through. I had to read this book for a high school Lit class, otherwise I wouldn\'t have finished it. I have seen at least one movie for all of her books, though, so I know none of them are my cup of tea. Pride and Prejudice is the least aggravating. Mr. Collins, Lady Catherine, and Lydia are sort of funny I guess, but not much. The part where Lydia elopes is okay, because it is the only time in her entire career that JA makes her characters show any strong emotion. And Mr. Darcy is kind of hot in the six-hour movie, but so what.\n\nMaybe I would have liked Jane Austen if I had been introduced to her when I was thirteen. There\'s nothing in Emma that pisses off the moral guardians, but at least sex and violence can be entertaining when they aren\'t too gratuitous, whereas shallowness and materialism ... are ... just ... boring. JA\'s heroines don\'t seem to think about anything other than finding rich husbands and wearing fancy dresses to the local ball.\n\nIn the words of Charlotte Bronte, "Anything like warmth or enthusiasm, anything energetic, poignant, heartfelt, is utterly out of place in commending these works: all such demonstrations the authoress would have met with a well-bred sneer ... ruffles her reader by nothing vehement, disturbs him with nothing profound ... Jane Austen was a complete and most sensible lady, but a very incomplete and rather insensible (not senseless woman)."'
2	"Unfortunately I didn't find the story didn't grab me and my interest, I kept waiting for the excitement and that was the last few chapters"
2	"Leon was unlikable at the beginning. Julie seemed to want to only satisfy her urges. Seemingly a match made in heaven.\n\nI skipped through many of Julie's fantasy scenes. I would have rather read about 'real' experiences she had with Leon. There were too many of the fantasy moments.\n\nThere were moments that held my attention, but not enough to keep  me entertained.  I finished the book, but it was difficult."
2	'Decent story, but I have  seldom seen such a mangling of the rules concerning grammar, punctuation, and sentence structure! Virtually every page contains one or more errors such as run on sentences, sentence fragments, tense shifts, and punctuation mistakes. Words are the building blocks of a novel with grammar and punctuation the tools of their construction. I suggest the author might want to find a competent proof reader if he seriously wants to be published in a major format.'
2	"Nothing really valuable here. It's general knowledge that you are better off reading on the internet for free.  Read only if you have kindle with prime and can get this free (like me)"
2	'The ideas are far original, but of the information about those businesses were helpful.'
1	'I only read a few chapters, but with a total of ten books I stopped there. Not my type of book.'
1	"I am surprised at the high reviews on Amazon. Other than mentioning the protagonist had 'curves' a few times, there was nothing really related to BBW. Also I thought the plot, buildup to how they get involved with each other was not done at all.\n\nVery strange book - no chemistry between the two main characters!"
2	'Disjointed and slow, not to mention weird family dynamics and a wishy-washy main character.'
1	'Repetitive, redundant, fills up a lack of detail in the story by repeating the plot line and character names over and over and over...Weak science, weak history, Ignores the obvious interesting questions like, how does the food they eat give them power over the "Energy"?'
1	"I read the reviews for this book, and I thought I would give it a go.\nThis book was so bad I couldn't even get through it.  The main female character is not easy to like. She is judgmental, hateful, and completely contradicts herself constantly. The main male character has the same voice as the female character, so I am not sure why there were two different characters telling the same story. It read like a 13 year old's journal.\nThe book is full of run-on sentences that are hard to read, and the timeline is not very clear.\nIt is a very poorly written story, which is unfortunate because the potential for a story along these lines is great.\nDon't even waste your time."
1	"Not good. Can I say that even though I couldn't bring myself to finish it?\nWish i had read the reviews first"
2	"I'm sure there are others who would enjoy this selection of novellas but they were not for me. Except the one with the dead guy I can't even remember the stories."
1	'should never have been published....better than you approach to buuilding a socialist agenda is not teh best approach...more rigour would have helped...'
2	'Very misleading. This is billed as a Bible crossword, implying that all of the clues are Bible based. Not so. Clues include names of Hollywood actresses and sports teams and other arbitrary clues. It is more of a general cross word with some Bible clues thrown in.'
1	'Gave up on this one at 36% through when there was no discernible plot.  At this point, I could predict a plot, but shouldn\'t have to!  The only thing I know is that the Heroine has friends and likes to run .  The Hero had friends and likes to run.  Couple of other politically correct nice things about them both have been mentioned.  Heroine is taking massive chances with her safety in order to preserve her independence.  Like I care.  This book is BORING.  If I were to guess, this is YET ANOTHER book where the "smart, strong, independent" Heroine does something incredibly stupid and the strong, military-like Hero rescues her.\nDear authors:  A man who is a hero will rescue a woman who does dumb things.  If he is smart, however, he won\'t fall in love with her.  It is possible for nice, kind, smart women to be in positions NOT OF THEIR OWN MAKING and need rescuing.  That is the story I want to read.\nDear Reader:  DON\'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS ONE.'
2	'Sorry could not finish it and I really like her books'
2	'I have never given a rating less than 4 stars. I am an avid reader and could not believe the ending of this book. It is not a long book to begin with but the primary male character had suffered enough in my opinion and the heroine is thrown under the bus . Why? So we can buy the next book, which is not necessarily about these two characters. This is not listed as a serial and there is no warning about this ending being a cliffhanger, a huge cliffhanger. I am tired of this and this book just left me spinning. I will not buy the next book or any other book by this author. The abrupt ending was unnecessary, grisly and not needed. We are left with NOTHING! No knowledge of what happened to anyone else, either.'
1	'I am sorry for purchasing this book. The photos were thumbnails and could not be enlarged. The "book" is nothing more than a brochure to sell other similar items. I would not recommend.'
2	'it was just too short. all of a sudden it ended. what happened to the little kids he saved ?'
1	"Not what I expected. Not one picture of a finished product. I'm a believer that a good cookbook should include pictures. Just because pictures are fun and inspiring."
2	'I\'ll note that I bought this book about 3 weeks ago and have only been able to force myself to read 30% of it.  I liked the 2nd book in the series (have read through that a couple of times), but this one just drags and drags and drags for me.  I thought there would be some conflict between the two protagonists based upon the sample, but it has just become one mushfest.  There\'s no tension in the story in terms of either the relationship or the plot.  It\'s just a lot of physical attraction and no concerns about being "claimed" (despite not knowing what this even means).  My only question is do I continue reading in the hopes I can find some parts worth it or cut my losses?  The writing isn\'t great, the dialog is boring and I\'m skimming through the sex parts at this point.'
1	"This was a tough book to get through.  I understand that the author was trying to paint the heroine as strong, but she comes across as a withering flower.  The hero is a total a$$ and I found myself wondering when the book was going to end.  Seriously, she needed to grow the backbone she said she had and dump his wishy-washy butt.\nAnd the sexgoodness, that was like the only thing they did.argue and screw.  I was so disappointed.  I've read a couple of Susanna Carr's other books and loved them.  This one seemed to lack a plot and I really disliked the characters, not to mention the repetition just got old."
1	'Not what I suspected was looking more advanced exercises. Good for old people but not for acrobats in training etc.'
2	"A fun read, but the spelling mistakes and constant jerk from first person to third are hard to set aside. Couple that with the author just kind of short cutting to the fun of the characters knowing/doing stuff with no hard work needed to figure things out and you quickly get lost. Try it out, though, maybe I'm just picky."
1	'Honestly I grabbed the book because it was free... I got exactly what I paid for.  In my opinion there is nothing "Ultimate" about it.  Please just save your time and skip this thing.'
2	'Let me start off by first saying that I have no qualms about authors using curse words in books; my husband is a soldier so I am very familiar with dirty curse words. I could have really liked this book except for the curse word every other word.  I know the author gave a little "warning" but I really did not expect it to be that bad.  NO ONE SPEAK LIKES THIS. I don\'t care if you\'re dealing with bikers...NO ONE SPEAKS LIKE THIS. My husband and the other soldiers he works with curse A LOT and even they don\'t speak like that. And I\'m sorry but I can\'t stand the referring to women as B\'s in every other sentence. I don\'t care how cool a man is with his friends, I find it hard for them to allow said man to refer to his woman as the B word or to talk so graphically about that woman\'s private parts and how she is in bed.\n\nThe story had a lot of potential but I couldn\'t get pass the language. It was as if the author needed a certain amount of word counts and thought she would use curse words as fillers.'
1	"I usually find something good to say about a book, but,this one.....  First I do not like an abbreviated story. There is usually two stories going on in P&P books. The first is what is actually happening & the other is why, the background of the characters. This book was totally without thought. Hill just wrote a meandering tale. From the letter writing (never done) to the dialogue. Let's just see........ emotional mess, get pregnant, fallback plan, out with it??????? Need I say more???"
1	'I NEVER RECEIVED THIS ORDER.'
2	"I'm new to this and i am looking for more information, this book has only one idea in it, not worth the money"
1	"Can't I give it zero stars?  Pitifully incomplete guide on Social Security, and it says it's a guide on Medicare, but there couldn't have been more than a half dozen pages on that topic.  Somehow in as short of a book as this is, it managed to be repetitive about certain things, yet miss major topics.  It did not mention, for example, the strategy to employ if one spouse is non-working and the other spouse is working.  There was not a word about file and suspend.  I could have learned more on the Social Security web site.  $2.99 is $3 more than it's worth.  I read it in 15 minutes and then returned it for a refund."
1	'No diet plan, just a compilation of recipes you can get anywhere. Title.  Misleads to expecting menus  and diet plans not just recipes. Mentions nothing about 30 day challenge.\nFree'
1	"This character doesn't work in short stories in my opinion and the plot is slow at first and then unravels quickly. Not up to his normal excellent standard"
2	"I thought I was buying a cozy mystery but apparently this is a children's book.  It appears to be a very good read aloud book for children."
2	"I  believe that the quality of a book is one of the most important criteria to satisfy one'sappetite for a good read. For this series, all I can say is its extremely boring. I had to force myself to stay awake, each time as I tried to finish it. The plots, the characters even the conspiracies were disappointing. 2 stars for the attempt."
1	"This has the same collection of scribbles and pictures of the author and a few animals--it's NOT a kids' book.  It's a blatent attempt to make money from the Kindle Unlimited program, uploaded by a scammet."
2	'I\'d not read this author\'s work before but the premise sounded interesting and there were many good reviews so I thought I would give it a chance. I am now left wondering if we all read the same book.\n\n  The writing alternates between sophomoric and syrupy/saccharine. At one point, Presley actually says "It would be better if I were blind; I don\'t have as much to offer the world as you." (Blechh!) Virtually every person she encounters (except, of course, Zane\'s friends) is so disgusted by her appearance that they feel the need to comment on it. She is told by a stranger in an elevator to get her face fixed but that insurance wouldn\'t pay for it because it was "cosmetic" (huh? a stranger in an elevator?).\n\n  The author would be well served by use of a dictionary and/or thesaurus. On no less than nine occasions we read how he/she "drug" (sic) his/her (fill in body part) across/against her/his--well, you get the idea. While I don\'t object to sex scenes that move a story along, by the time I finished this book I was finding them boring and repetitive (not to mention wanting to scream every time I read another "drug").\n\n  SPOILER ALERT! The side stories added little. The mystery about a missing woman which is solved by our brilliant, yet totally lacking in self-esteem, heroine was somewhat bizarre, particularly the part about the lawyer falling for her without ever having met her. The unknown cousins, the unresolved murder trial, and Aron\'s disappearance are clearly being used to set up future books but are poorly done.\n\n In sum, there are much better books out there.'
2	"Maybe one should be more tolerant, but series characters should be allowed to die with their creators.  Sherlock Holmes, Nick Carter, James Bond, etc. just don't fare well in the hands of anyone except the original author.  I did struggle through this book, but it isn't worth the effort.  Better to either reread Philip Marlowe's books or find acceptable newer series characters to follow."
2	"I'm not sure if it was the writing or the lack of editing that made this book unreadable for me, but I could not finish it. I found the plot interesting, but not enough for me to finish it."
1	'Not too detail as I hope for. Too basic and bad grammar. Just eh nice short story. Wished for more from it. End of it sucked'
1	'Boring history'
1	'As you listen to the voices of the characters all of them sound the same.  Also their reactions to events seem strange.  The villains are comic book like in that they have no redeeming characteristics and the good guys are too good.  It  is like a twelve year old wrote this.'
2	"In the author's defense, I finished an outstanding book earlier today and then followed up immediately with this one, so I may be grading it harshly. But it just didn't get there for me."
2	'Snow Angel by Melanie Shawn\n Excessive use of the words "hot" and "sexy" killed this story.  There was too much narrative of people thinking about the hotness of someone, heat pooling to some area of the heroine\'s, Lilly, body or the hero, Eric, getting hard. There are too many uninteresting characters, who are just talking to talk about all kinds of uninteresting stuff that have nothing to do with anything.  Skipping pages. It\'s like the author is just adding in stuff haphazardly to lengthen the book.  Skipping pages. One-third of this story is about the hero/heroine. The rest is about other stuff--her and the dog, him and the dog, her and him and the dog, her and the girls, her and his family.  Skipping pages. Get to what she is running from or stop alluding to it. Whatever Lilly is running from should be in the forefront with, Eric trying to figure it out. It shouldn\'t take forever for the FBI to tell him information. Skipping pages.  Even the sex is uninteresting.  Skipping pages.\n\nBy time this book picked up speed it was over. So the hero and the villain finally meet.  They both had guns, but instead of shooting the villain , the hero  screams ,"No," lunges at the villain, then crouches below the window with his gun drawn to see where the villain ended up?\n\nAgain, wasn\'t in the The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly, the Clint Eastward movie with Eli Wallach",  in which Wallach shouted, "If you\'re going to shoot, shoot don\'t talk?"  Anyways, I happy the story ended well.\n\nI measure the success of a story by its power to erase the last story and its hero/heroine from my mind.  This story did not do it, so it won\'t make my read again list on a rainy night in Georgia, when I \'m curled up in my lazy boy chair in front of the fireplace with a glass of wine on the side table.'
2	"Blindly downloading a story because it was free. When will I ever learn?\n\nI am a straight individual, however I have nothing against the gay community. I would just really prefer to keep what goes on between them, BETWEEN THEM. It's just that it is always a shock to open one of these books.\n\nBut if anything, I feel that I would have been more absorbed in the story, if I were on the side of the fence it was written on. The subject matter was pretty good. I like the idea behind a human slayer and a vampire combo. In this aspect, I found the story on the more enjoyable side.\n\nWill recommend to my friends, where-in-which it applies."
1	'The only good thing about this book was that I bought it on kindle and as a result, I was able to delete it. It had asolutely zero useful information in it, and was instead mostly packed with junk like "believe in yourself", "set goals", "make a plan", "work hard", etc.\n\nFor a book like this, I wouldn\'t ding someone for grammar and sentences being a mess, as long as the book was useful, but it wasn\'t.'
1	'Interesting story but a short one! No worth the cost.'
1	"Don't bother buying this book, it's written badly, and contains very superficial advice. I finished it in about 20 minutes."
2	'Cute trite easy read.'
2	"Good book but it's not very long the rest of the book is junk. Good kid book though. I expected more."
1	"I can't even read it. The font is so tiny that even trying to adjust the font size on my Kindle doesn't help. Not worth a buck."

2	"Geez, I don't know why I finish reading this book when all I read is how beautiful Bea was, sex, then lame reason why they cant be together, and how sexy Daniel is, then sex and another sex, repeat. It's not easy to have a long distance relationship but it CAN be done, mine is a very successful example. With Daniel's wealth, distance is not going to be a problem.\n\nThe book failed to hold my emotions because I find the problem to be very shallow, a lot of couples are into a long distance relationship. Take the service men and their wives for example, those people who work out of their own country for a contract of at least two years without going back to their families in that period of time, those are common in the third world countries, they survive, sure they have their ups and downs but they still make it happen. It was hard for me to sympathized with the characters in this book, they make one simple issue affect them so much. Love is a sacrifice, when you're the one who's most hurting then I believe you're the one who's supposed to yield, and in this book I think it was Bea.\n\nI bought this book six months ago, started reading it then lose interest because it was boring, read it again today in respect of the author but come on, this book is all about sex which by the way is average. I started skipping pages after pages after fifty percent of the book. So if you think you want to be frustrated today go ahead download a sample."
2	'I found the book well written, as much as i read. But just too much\ngraphic details per the crime scene... which i am sure was apart of\nthe story.... just a bit disturbing for my taste.'
1	'This is my first taste of Doctorow and will be my last.  He goes on and on about the human condition.  His angst is palpable.  He could inspire depression in a stone.  His upper middle class characters are not interesting.  They are  vehicles for aspects of life that only he examines while  the rest  Of us stumble through life.  His work is critically acclaimed.  I am thinking his reviewers have never ever indulged in introspection so his words come as a revelation to them.  I want to say oh, put a sock in it.'
1	"Very little thought has gone into these books, they are all very bland. The action parts, short as they are, fail to captivate the reader. Might be good for people who don't read much."
1	"The story was promising, but it was too hard to get through the poor editing and writing. The language was stilted, confusing and almost like epic poetry one moment and in the next it sounded and felt like a contemporary novel. The plot was simple and resolved too fast and clean at the end. I had to skip most of the book because I couldn't stand reading it, but still wanted to know how the story ended. I wish the author had been more consistent with her writing, because I could have really liked this book if she had."
2	"My guess is no one. Some of the people who contributed to this didn't use words correctly. Lots of grammar errors. So much so that it takes away from the stories."

2	'"Screw It! What If You Can Turn It Around and Live the Life You Want on Your Own Terms?" or "Life Hacking: Life Lessons To Help You Turn Adversities To Victories, Crush It And Live The Life You Want" by Mayowa Ajisafe promises to be a self-help book that should inspire readers to turn their failures into successes, pursue their dreams and experience freedom and fulfillment in life.\n\nWell, let me say first of all that I don\'t think the book achieves its goal!\n\nFirstly, the many errors of grammar generate frustration while reading the book. Some quick examples:\n"I\'ve always love to tread a different..."\n"I\'ve get some amazing stories to share..."\n"Maybe you can get guess..."\n"Are you new to blogging, and you have be thinking of ways to launch your blog?"\n"...then take a sit and enjoy..."\n"I want-a life that conform to any rules or anyone\'s expectation but a life that seems sensible to me that guarantees me three things -Freedom, Fun, and Fulfillment."\nThe list could go on and on but I stop here. General common sense would require that a general spell check be done before releasing the book on any platform.\n\nSecondly, this does not feel like a book: it is a collection of blog entries put together to look like a book. The logic of each so called "chapter" is very weak, I\'m sorry to say: it starts with a promise but then fails to deliver. It\'s extremely frustrating. The chapters don\'t flow naturally into a book structure either. A lot of the chapters contain the same examples over and over again...\n\nThirdly, although it claims to belong to the self-help books category, this book fails achieving this task. It reads more like an autobiographical account from a person that claims to be shy, modest and only interested in living a life of "Freedom, Fun, and Fulfillment." It transpires that the author is nothing like he claims to be.\n\nAnother quote from the book, I think, sums it all up:\n\n"Maybe I still suck at writing things, but sure, you are reading this at this moment, and that is enough to tell you that it never takes being a perfect writer or a William Shakespeare to write something useful and interesting to read. Aren\'t you reading what I have to say now?"\n\nReading the above statement made me almost abandon the book and do something better with my time. Still, I went on out of curiosity, asking myself if there was a point to this book or how much worse can it get.\n\nI can only grant the author one thing: the determination to go through failure after failure but still trying his hand at other things. Maybe, someday the money will come... Sure it is necessary to keep trying but a good place to start would be improving your skills: if you want to be a writer you need your writing skills improved. It\'s not enough to write three books in a month and proclaim yourself to be a "best-selling author." It is a waste of your readers time and soon enough you might not have any!\n\nI received the book for free, in exchange for an honest review, which I gave above.'
2	'The book was just ok, I found myself skipping ahead( which I never do) just to finish it. The end was cheesy , not a book I would tell a friend to read.'

1	"This book just didn't do it for me. I don't know that I would read the rest of the series since I felt that the characters lacked depth . I did not mind the pony play aspect except for the fact that the women had no personality or thoughts of their own . I felt like the women were completely subservient without character they were just there to do what the husband wanted they weren't there for any other purpose than to please the man . I enjoy reading BDSM and domestic discipline but with this book I just felt that the woman's voice was not heard ."
1	"this book is an absolute waste of time. the authors inexperience in telling a story is apparent. choppy sentences with lack of story telling skills and building suspense makes it hard to stay focused. I wouldn't recommend this at all."
1	"This is not a book it is not a guide and it has no tricks. Just a general essay about iPads. Total waste. Don't bother."
2	"I reviewed this at MustReadBooksOrDie with my friend Shelley!\n\nShel: This novel picks up with Cassie and Josh as husband and wife trying very hard to adopt their biological son and find their footing in their marriage. It's been 6 years and those six years were growing and maturing years...post high school, beginning to figure things out years...so they definitely have some things to work out. They have issues. I mean, if you think about it, of course they do...they're young, trying to reconnect with each other and their son...it's a lot of pressure.\n\nCourt: Everything is such a whirlwind for them. You pointing out those six years apart, with a lot of bitterness and heartache in between (see book one for those deets!) and here we are. I had high hopes that they would be able to reconnect with one another, but all of the things stressing these two are going to be very hard to overcome.\n\nShel: Cassie seems lost to me. Again, she's young and has had a TON of unfortunate incidents to stunt her search for what she wants out of her life...and so with all of that, she just seemed lost. She's sweet and hardworking and loyal...and lost. She knows she wants her son and she loves Josh--those things she absolutely KNOWS...but how to be a parent to a 5 year old, how to be a wife, how to have a career she loves--those things she has a harder time with.\n\nCourt: Yikes. Sometimes with how they act, it is hard to remember that they're both only 24. And at the end of the day, sure they've grown up a lot, but they still lack some of the life experience that would mean going through these treacherous waters intact. Heck, that is my age and I know I don't have it all figured out so I would be majorly freaked to have all of my personal life laid bare in the way that hers is. I am 110% on Team Cass for most of this one.\n\nShel: Josh, while a little more directed, also seemed to lose his way at times. He has dreams of being a politician but also wants to be a father and husband and, with the hours he works, he doesn't seem to know how to make all of that work. He pauses often to question how he can juggle all of his desires in a way that will be fair and good to them all.\n\nCourt: Here is where I started to slip up. Sometimes Josh seemed to be too ambitious. That word is thrown around a lot, and from experience being ambitious in Washington D.C. doesn't usually bode well for the families of those people. An ambitious politician doesn't always do what he should do, so I spent a lot of time worried about whether or not Josh was going to step up!\n\nShel: So we have these two people trying to figure love and career and life out...now throw in a rigorous adoption process and people trying to create problems and you have more issues. In addition, they didn't seem to be connecting to each other very well ...so the entire time I felt incredibly frustrated. I wanted Cassie and Josh to be on the same page MORE, wanted more intimate moments, MORE details at the end, more connection...don't get me wrong, the ending isn't cliffy...it just felt like (for me), it needed more story about how they managed to get where they got. After all of their struggle, I wanted to live in the story of how they came together and feel the warmth of that more. It was definitely very real in the way the characters voiced frustrations and fears and struggles--I'm betting any 20-somethings in their shoes would feel a lot like Cassie and Josh. I just wanted a smidge more of the reward after working with them through their struggles.\n\nCourt: I completely agree. Their story becomes resolved, but I felt there was something missing in their connection that we felt in the first book. Maybe it was because a lot of the scenes in the first book were in the past when we knew they were in love. Now they (and us along with them) are not sure of that fact, so it is hard to get from point a to point b for me as well in the time frame that this story is set. The ending felt a little bit too rushed, to the point where I was having whiplash by the changing of thought processes going on in the epilogue. That was very disjointed and had me confused. After such great love for the first book I think the expectations in my head clouded my enjoyment of this one.\n\nShelley: 2 Stars\nCourtney: 2 stars"
1	'Poorly executed rip off of Empire from the Ashes. Doesnt flesh out charcters or background. Doesnt explain how a society that seems post scarcity economy  can fall into a huge decline.'
1	'I downloaded this free, and it wasn\'t worth the price.  This "book" is nothing more than basic "workout 101" information which could be easily garnered by a simple google search or by skimming an issue of about any fitness magazine.  If printed out, this wouldn\'t be more than a few pages in length--I read it in about 5 minutes and was just shocked that somebody would have the gall to charge even $.99 for this.\n\nI admire people\'s entrepreneurial ambition, but just because somebody is "ambitious" enough to aggregate and publish such information does not mean the results are worthy of other people\'s money.'

1	"I really can say I definitely did not enjoy this book and I regret even buying the series. I don't like the fact that they shift only once a month, they can't control it and for one thing they act feral when they shift and just attack everything. I didn't like Hawke at all. This was not a typical shifter romance I also hated how long it took Hawke to even tell him about shifting the whole book was boring I had to skip pages to finish it"
1	"This book did not download properly. When you change the page, you get a portion of the previous section you have just read. It will also skip a whole page.

2	"And that was a feat for me. This book has some pros and cons. Her insufferably stringing them both along the whole way with no remorse or thought til the very end truly P'ed me off. The brainlessness of that nearly had me walking away numerous times but I finished it. For her character to be a borderline genius she's a freaking idiot."

1	"This book is not even close to what I thought it would be it barely help me at all. I took the cast test and failed they say this book will help you to get the grade you need that's a lie. The reading comprehension part of the test from the book has very simple wording and easy questions that you can answer. The real cast test has wording that only if you have been studying grammar for a while you would know what the words meant. The mechanical concept part of the book has easy pictures to look at in the take a guess the real test I found had stuff that I had never seem in the book if you are going to buy this book I recommended you don't it won't help you but a little I studied this book for a month and failed the book is not what is says it is."
2	'Before I go any further, let me tell you that I was one of those people who read this originally on Wattpad. I had hoped that Bella had gone far and actually invested in an editor for this book, maybe fleshed out better scenes. While she had fleshed out a lot, this book needs a lot of work. ALSO, I couldn\'t finish this book. Not often for me to leave something, and if I go back and reread this, I\'ll edit some more points. As it\'s standing, I got through 20% of the book before I had to put it down.\n\nI have a couple of things to say before I begin, I glanced at the price of Bella Johnsons book. The paperback price is set WAY too high. Im sorry, most people will NOT shell out twenty dollars for a book they know almost nothing about. I read the teaser and Im still not convinced that this book is worth twenty one dollars.\n\nNow, this book, as beautiful as the cover art is, don\'t be fooled. This book will be a light, teen romance, with little to no plot otherwise. The characters seem to gravitate and float around the main character named Chloe; but other than that, they seem to have almost no depth to them. Complex characters are harder to find in this world, but they do exist, however briefly they are allowed to show up.\n\nThings I liked:\n\nI liked her characters voice. Dont get me wrong, her main character makes me want to smack things with a sledgehammer, but thats not a bad thing. Youre supposed to hate characters, and even get frustrated with the main character from time to time. In the beginning, I really did not enjoy the main characterbut as the story went on, I slowly waded into her way of thinking.\n\nI liked the world. I wish that Chloe had actually pulled that stick out of her butt and actually explored the world she was thrown into a bit more. More shops, more culture, more snow. Just to see the good in the world beyond some stuck up teenager\'s POV. Y\'know, see a moose, watch some people ice fish, do something other than sulk around. And if you don\'t like it when the characters just sit there and complain, then this book is not for you.\n\nThings I didn\'t like:\n\nThe editing. This book needs a LOT of it. I spotted several mistakes, and things that I pet peeve aboutlike the word towards while THAT word and toward mean the same thing, the proper way to write it would be without the s added to it, I also spotted other words with the unneeded s attached to the end, to make the main character seem more like a teenager it would seem.  Missing periods, missing quotation marks, commas where there should be periods, wrong word choices (their instead of they\'re or there) you get my point.\n\nThe Dialogue. Huge part of a book, and in Alaska, this fell rather flat. Some conversations were completely pointless and sometimes I wondered what was going through the authors head when she wrote it. There was one, fairly early in the book, where Chloe and Grayson were talking about the bus, and Grayson naturally just brushes her off and tells her to take the dang thing if shes upset about him giving her a ride, then at the end of the conversation, he asks her if shes on the route. Now, this entire thing is horrible. There is no chronological clarity to it. If they had started with eliminating Chloes other options, then they wouldve come to a better outcome. The entire scene just makes me shutter.\n\nThe way the author described people and things. Chloes eyes are iced over like her eyes are the most stunning pale blue that people only accomplish when they wear solid blue contact lenses. Many people have a broken, short sentence describing them, usually the first thing that pops into mind when you first see someone. Thats fine for the characters voice, but it wouldve been better if we could be told a little bit more about a character, other than they had horrible skin and less than great hair.\n\nThe way the MC seemed to know things that were not apparent earlier in the book. Somehow, out of the blue, she seems to know that Grayson doesnt like Anne, she starts dreaming about wolves when we had no indication about her actually STARTING. She suddenly knows someone better after just being in the room with them for five minutes, ignoring them.\n\nThe Romance is not there. Now, don\'t get me wrong, there is "love" in this book, and I say that loosely because you don\'t see someone and then fall head over heals with them, but there is no Romance. Passion, love, getting to know someone, that is what Romance is, and this book has them hooking up in four days time.\n\nThe plot. I thought that I could be able to see more of a plot, but there wasn\'t even a glimpse when I stopped reading the book. It\'s sad because that\'s very important when you write you book.'

1	"In mourning her husband's tragic accidental death, Giselle is understandably angry at his premature loss. In her grief, she wrongly blames his best friend, Hugh who was with him at the time of the accident. But as time passes, she not only realizes how unfairly she has judged Hugh, she also falls in love with him. In the interest of full disclosure, I must admit that I am not a fan of short stories in general because the form simply does not allow for sufficient character or plot development. Unfortunately, that is the case with Heart of a Highlander as well. However, I did enjoy Cameron's dialog and writing style, so I would be open to trying something in a longer format from her in the future."
2	'I am a fan of Tasha Blue. Typically her books draw me in with beautifully crafted characters, relatable drama, and spicy love scenes... needless to say Baby Buddies was a huge disappointment. Both the heroine and hero constantly said the same thing with varying verbiage to describe the same situation. The heroine was also weak, the hero even weaker. It was just a mess, the plot lacked sufficient detail, coupled with redundant passages, and lackluster romantic encounters, I would rate this book a two or less. There was even no mention of the familial ties for this new addition. Again, just oversights on the authors part. I feel like I purchased a rough draft.'
1	'Fake news'
1	"I can't believe the immaturity of the characters in this trilogy.  Hunter hides the truth constantly, I wouldn't trust hi as far as I could throw him. And she acts like a 12 year old. Very unforgettable book. This could have been made in one book instead of 3."
1	"Boring! Didn't even finish the book."
1	'this was so poor...cliffhanger much? this reminded of someone telling bits and bits of story...here and there...and then just stops. As if the storyteller gets bored or out of ideas...and then just decided to end the story with a see ya later. and im left with an open mouth not believing it.'

1	"I was not a big fan of this book the meals I tried tasted awful and the books seems like I have read it before. I wish I could have something nice to say about the book but I just don't. I received this book at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review."
1	"This story was full of romance and all good things......until the ending. It then became flat and hurried. The rest of the book was full of detail and was fun.  Maybe the author became bored or just couldn't be bothered. I invested the time to read this book and found it insulting to  be so disregarded.  I will not be reading anymore of Ms Blayneys' books"

2	"I could tell the author was trying to mimic the Stephanie Plum series, but it just didn't hit the mark.  Way too fluffy, completely unrealistic and the characters were all one dimensional.  I won't be reading any more in the series."
2	"Honestly the reason I give this 2 stars instead of 1 is simply because the story it self is good I guess, but only if your cheering for Tristan and Sophie to be together. I felt freakin sorry for Garret and I thought Tristan was soo...boring. Plus whats the point in reading a romance novel if the characters are in love with each other from the beginning?????? I didn't finish it because the story seemed too centered on Sophie and Tristan and yea I looked for a spoiler cuz if they ended up together I was uninterested in reading the rest of the book. I do think that Jennifer Haymore is a good author but personally I just didn't like who the heroine chooses. Poor Garret! At least he gets his own story which I may or may not read I think I was too disappointed with this one to try it out."
1	'The EFQM User Guide is helpful to readers who have zero knowledge of DMAIC. The word "Guide" in the title is deceiving because the author takes you to a beginners level of understanding then the journey ends. If you have access to a computer, enter the search word "DMAIC" and you will learn more about the subject than paying for the book. Amazon Books have many beefy DMAIC selections that are worth the expense. Save the money you spend on the EFQM User Guide and buy a Lean Methodology book with substance.'

1	"I bought this on my iTouch iPod for the Kindle application and was sorely disappointed when it was only the Prologue of the book. No where in the title, or the description, does it say that it is only the Prologue. Since the picture of the book cover is very small on the iTouch, I couldn't see it there. Instead, I just bought this assuming that it was the full book, just under a different name.\n\nIt would have been very helpful if any mention that this was only the Prologue was in the book description. I will, if I use Amazon again, pay much more attention to details. I really don't see how they can get away with just selling the Prologue of a book..\n\nIn any case, this is not worth the price and a complete waste space on your iTouch or Kindle. You are better off buying the whole book when it comes out for Kindle instead."
1	'A horrible book written, most of the material is not original, and the exposition is far from clear. The book is more like a technical bag of poorly designed tools instead of systematic investigation on a mathematical topic.'
1	"This is a book of human endurance for how long you can continue to read it before giving up. Its so terribly written, so padded, so drawn out, and so unbelievably boring.  There appears be so little of a tale to tell that the author just keeps prolonging the same scene, same event, or same period in this non-story that you feel like you are endlessly reading the same chapter over and over.  At the 55% point I gave up. I knew as much at that point as I did after 2 chapters.  Its going nowhere. Probably the worst book I've read, ever.\nDon't waste your time, or your money.  Awful, awful, awful, in every sense imaginable."
1	'Worst book I have read in a long time.'
1	'I was looking for owner financing information. He never talked about the different types of creative financing. Never gave case scenarios.'
1	'Read all three books (purchased as group or would never have gone beyond the first); kept waiting for the payoff which never arrived.  There were some interesting characters, settings, and decent plot lines, but these weren\'t nearly enough to overcome the poor writing.  As others have noted the writing was amateurish and simplistic; especially noticeable were poorly developed characters, typo\'s, sentences that didn\'t make sense, phrases that were repeated ad nauseam, and the author having characters switch back and forth between modern vernacular and what was supposed to be more traditional medieval speech.\n\nWhat really made the books a frustrating read were characters that behaved inexplicably or that were constantly changing there power levels and personalities.  The lead character starts out as a timid inexperienced teenager with no battle experience, a few scenes later he is presented as a Conan level swordsmen who can barely contain his desire to hack people into bloody pieces.  Later his magical abilities allow him to decimate all comers, but then suddenly he is getting beat on by a character that was running from him just a scene or two ago.  The part with the dragon nimbly dodging the hero\'s magic attacks was nonsensical, dragon big as a bus and its dodging magical lightning bolts (must be reeeeaaallyy slow lightning bolts)?!?  I don\'t know how many times I read about the hawk that "puffed out its chest with pride", after the first couple of times I wanted to gouge out my eyes (or the hawk\'s eyes).\n\nOne of the worst offenders was undoubtedly the scene where the protagonist\'s friend getting stung by the giant scorpion.  Words can not do justice to such an awkward plot device, but I\'ll try.  I need the king\'s best friend to be brought to the verge of death, so how will i accomplish this??  I will put the two of them in combat in a dungeon room with a demon-scorpion the size of a large dog, during the ensuing fight the monster will somehow disappear into a crack in the wall, and when the hero goes over retrieve the sword that he clumsily dropped,  the scorpion will jump back into the room and fatally sting him!! Yeah that works!  I admit I have zero practical experience dungeoneering, but i feel certain that if I had been there I would have kept track of the giant demon-scorpion, especially if I had dropped my only weapon!\n\nObviously, tastes differ and everyone is entitled to their opinions, but to describe this as epic, well written, or to compare it to Tolkien is preposterous.  If not for some Very Adult scenes it would be an ok read for younger, non-critical readers, but if you are looking for great fantasy writing look elsewhere!'
1	"You, sonny boy, are living proof of what satan can do to anyone who opens the door of doubt.  It happened to Eve and it's happened to YOU.  If your soul means no more to you than to write such a book as this then maybe you are one of those who really DO end up in that lake of fire.  Shame on you!"
2	"Reading it was like playing any mechwarrior PC game without a solid storyline. 4 IS mechwarriors manage to wreck such havoc among clan? I dont't think so. Clanners always missed and the IS warriors always take down much heavier mechs.\nI really like the author (many superb books) and his contribution to the BT/MW universe is hardly matched, but this is his worst work."
2	"I just didn't realize it was that short. I wish I could give it 5 stars for the story line as it was HOT. I wonder if the author could go back and finish the story.  All you read is Reggie telling Clara that her MIL is walking in on them. So not only is it short, it's also a cliffhanger."
2	'The story and characters were ok but forgettable. The author\'s use of his Thesaurus was distracting.  Words like "portents", "coquettishly", "conflagrations", "indefatigable", "detritus", "consternation" were correctly used but totally unnecessary.  I would have stopped half way through the book however I found myself reading only for the next recondite and abstruse word rather than the story (see what I mean?).  I was really looking forward to more amazing phrases such as "scattered incandescent remnants of a titanic inferno" and chapter titles such as "The period of portents".'
1	"If possible, the editing in this book is even worse than the first. I truly wonder if it wasn't translated from another language using an online translation tool. The author is definitely an armchair quarterback and has a great disdain for the military establishment. His tactics and handling of physics is horrid for anyone who is an aficionado of military sci-fi or space opera. The story is also very slow paced to the point of needing to play solitaire between pages for something a little more exciting. One of the worst books I have read and I am sorry I invested so much time in reading it."
2	'It was ok and somewhat helpful but most of it was old info nothing new really. A few things may be useful to someone but just not for me.'
1	"Try something else.  Characters just didn't jive and then ended.  I wish I could get my time back from reading this."

1	"Just didn't get anything new from the book. Save your money"
2	'Many mistakes (very few corrected in the ebook editions) and poorly compiled.\n\nI found my answers wrong many times because I made mistakes in grammar in points not yet covered.  The spoken recordings are dubious. The included vocabulary is often insufficient for the exercises and I had to resort to my Hippocrene Practical Dictionary. Other words in the vocabulary aren\'t even used elsewhere in the book.\n\nIt does cover a lot of ground (which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of only 1) however do not get this book as your first choice! I found that Colloquial Afrikaans by Bruce Donalson a much better (but "drier") book, and came back to this one to build upon what I had learned.\n\nI seriously expect the publishers to fully correct or rewrite this course in their next edition.'

2	"Ok, so I finished the book. This books was like  a high adrenaline movie...bullets fly, but the hero never gets hit. Not really my kind of book...I like the idea that the fiction is possible...this book...no so much.  Also, I have trouble with a man having sexual relations with someone who can't fully understand the  relationship due  to mental or neurologic issues."
2	"This is another one of those that I didn't want to finish as I didn't care for it from the start."
2	"The cover made me expect something humorous and instead I got a romance. To be honest I couldn't put this trashy novel down. It was entertaining but forgettable. Engaging but tedious. There was some clever repartie between secondary characters but the child was far too mature for his age: A defect most American children in works of fiction suffer from.\nLast time I read something like this I was 15 years old and besides the more explicit sexual encounters it looks like the formula has nor changed much."

2	"The story finishes with the main character doing something so unbelievably stupid that my guess is that the author was tired of writing the book and couldn't think of any other way to end it. I won't read any more in this series, and probably no more by this author."
2	"Not as touted. States it is important to cool foods properly to maintain food safety, but does not give any directions how to do that for any of the recipes. Several recipes do not give specific quantities (1 package of pasta could be anything from 7 oz to 16 oz). Directions for actually serving the food do not specify how many servings are being reheated, which is frustrating since the # of servings per recipe varies from 3 to 12 or so. If I were reheating for a family, I'd need the same # of servings for each family dinner, yes? If I am reheating for one or two persons, must I reheat all 8 servings?\nWorst of all, one of the recipes starts with a purchased frozen entre and adds more sauce... so can we conclude that purchased frozen food is NOT all that bad?\nI returned this."
2	"I enjoyed the end of this book but it was definitely too long. So many details that were not necessary, made the story drag on and on. I was so tempted to stop reading at so many parts but then I just started skipping sections. Obviously didn't skip anything important because I always knew what was happening."
2	'The first 3 stories were really dry and hard to get into.  The last story was amazing.'
2	"I want to find good things to say about this one, but it's not easy. It's incredibly short - I can't understand the justification for charging $3.79 for a 60 page short story. It's not even really a novella. I think the length really did a disservice to the story and it's probably why it's so hard to like. There was absolutely no room for character and plot development.\n\nI think it would have been a really interesting premise, getting inside the head of a woman who goes on a dating show after a bad breakup. That's about where it ends. Wynne is wishy-washy, Meredith is weird, Andy was bland and Callum seemed like a total creeper who has to show up right when Wynne is moving on. Maybe Wynne was making a mistake by moving on with Andy, but it seemed like she should have been able to get to that realization without her ex jumping in the mix.\n\nWhy not double the length of the story and provide meaningful interactions between Wynne and Andy and Wynne and Callum and give us some insight into why she had dated both of these men? I don't mind the ending of the story per se - it was different from the other books in the series and it could have been really powerful. However, the execution of the whole plot, including the ending, was lacking.\n\nI received a free copy of this book in exchange for review."
2	"I gave up at 28%.  It wasn't horrible but I was bored with the young characters.  The heroine had some potential but in the end I didn't have the interest in finding out.  The hero was also not very interesting.  Basically I think I was looking for more mature characters and wasn't in the mood for young innocents."
2	'Why is a man writing this story of an older woman'
2	"I should have read all the reviews. The main character is childish (not in an endearing way). I liked the concept of shifters even though I misunderstood and thought it was about wolves. The cover art didn't help. The love triangle wasn't done well. It bordered on the stupid and unrealistic. Yes I could believe shifting into animals more than the main character wanting both guys but everyone be friends and sing songs like Disney special. I think she tried to hard to have a moral high ground. No I won't have sex but yes I will kiss both guys. No I can't take expensive gifts unless it's a car. I didn't like the way she treated her parents either. She disregards them a lot. Maybe they couldn't afford a car for her. The story need polished. It's me, I like stronger more fleshed out characters."
2	'Kind of boring and predictable, maybe if it was longer I would have like it more because then the author could have gone into detail and characterisation a little more.'
2	"Just getting a brief view of the first five chapters leaves me with more questions than answers.  Quirky, strange, and interesting are how I would describe what I've read."
2	'I enjoy Eva Devon\'s work; she uses witty dialogue and strong characters.  I rated this book low because of the grammar mistakes, spelling errors, and lack of knowledge in word usage; e.g. A horse\'s "gate" which should be "gait" and misuse of "too" and "to".  The errors were too numerous to mention and I wonder if there was a proofreader who knows the English language.  That spoiled the reading of the book.'
2	"I usually enjoy Omar's books, but this one had too many grammatical errors. It was a distraction to the reading."
2	"Artist seemed as if it had a great deal of potential when I first started to read it.  The eyes of the woman on the cover just drew me in to this crime thriller, and the letters CLV on her forehead intrigued me.  I wanted to know what they stood for.\n\nThis the third book in a series devoted to Cassie Reynold, who has the paranormal gift of remote viewing. Since I hadnt read the first two books, I would have been interested in seeing a sample of Cassies gift in action.  Unfortunately, this didn't happen.  There is a reasonable explanation for Cassie avoiding the use of remote viewing within the context of this plot.  It was necessary for pragmatic reasons on her training assignment whose purpose was to develop the more conventional skills of law enforcement officers.  I understood that, but I was nevertheless disappointed.\n\nAlthough I did find Cassie sympathetic for most of the book, I thought she did get too intensely involved in the serial killer case over the course of the narrative.  In fact, she definitely seemed out of control toward the end of the book.  If I were her handler, I would have grave doubts about her.  She could very easily go rogue, and her paranormal gift might not be enough of a justification for retaining her as an agent.  Perhaps prolonging her training could settle her down.\n\nThere was also a very serious problem with the professional qualifications of the serial killer.  He is supposed to be an academic in the history field, but he confused two well-known figures in his period of specialization.  For this reason, I don't find him credible as a history instructor.  His personal background seemed fairly typical for serial killers in crime thrillers.  Yet if a character is supposed to be established in a particular profession, then he must be convincing in that role.\n\nThere was one police procedural mistake, and an instance of an experienced police officer reacting like a rookie in an exchange of fire.  It would have been more believable for Cassie to have had such a reaction.  She was the one who was the rookie.\n\nArtist is supposed to take place in New Orleans, but there was relatively little sense of place.  There were occasional superficial references to New Orleans culture, but I didn't feel that I was in New Orleans when I was reading this book.  I felt that this particular story line could easily have taken place in any American city.\n\nThere were fifteen copy reading errors in this book.  Two of them occurred in the same sentence.  There was also one example of poor sentence structure.  A writer needs to keep track of the subject of a sentence while composing it.  A policy of limiting sentence length would make this task easier.  The author should definitely have had this novel professionally edited.  Errors distract readers causing them to be less involved in the book.\n\nAlthough the plot of Artist was well-paced, the flaws that Ive enumerated above outweighed this one strength for me.  For this reason, I cant recommend Artist to other readers.  I hope that future books by this author will show improvement."
2	'This series I came upon by accident and was pleasantly surprised. The story has humor hunky grumpy bear shifters. Entertaining and I look forward to the next installment and to finding out what puny name it has. This is book two in the series so far.'

2	'I\'ve read the entire Psy/Changeling series and have loved nearly all of them. I\'ve noticed since "Heart of Obsidian," however, the quality of the stories has slipped, or maybe my appreciation for the formula is waning. Either way, I was annoyed with Walker and pitied Lara. When I read their story intertwined in previous novels, I liked the couple. Reading a story focused mainly on them completely changed my opinion of them as I found I didn\'t like Walker at all and Lara was just bland. I\'m just glad this was a novella instead of a full-length book and that I didn\'t pay very much for it.'
2	"I was really hoping I'd like this one since I liked Wingman so much and it features some of the same characters. But alas, that was not the case.\n\nThis book started off so strong - there's nothing I love more than a great hate to love story. And I thought that was where this one was headed. Unfortunately, after the first few chapters I quickly realized that this would not be the case.\n\nMy biggest problem is Ciara - it's hard to like a book when you find the heroine annoying. It's really hard to like it when you are constantly rolling your eyes at said heroine. I was hoping Ciara would fight back a bit and not give into Spike so easily - similar to what I read at the start. However, as the book continued, Ciara became somewhat of a doormat and it was all about making sure Spike got what he wanted. And for someone who supposedly knew Spike so well, she was constantly jumping to conclusions about him and it added unnecessary drama.\n\nSpeaking of unnecessary drama...there was a lot of it. Too much in my opinion. I know that this is an MC book and that's somewhat expected, but toward the end I was literally rolling my eyes at every page. I just couldn't handle it.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't think I'll check out the other books in this series."
2	"The characters were well developed; however, the dialogue was stilted and their actions/reactions were not always appropriate for the situation. I probably won't read the next books in this series."
2	'Cant really understand the game. I would not suggest this game to anybody. I have read the instructions still cant get it.'
2	"Frankly, the only mood I could tell was sexual...Not much of a read. If you just want to read dirty talk, then go ahead. I'm sorry I chose this book."
2	"I please I haven't read the book and I probably won't read the book it doesn't interest me\n\nI have no review to do\n\n."
2	'It was kind of cute because it was Jamie, but it did not really hold my interest.....no laugh out loud moments.'
2	'I found the heroine so annoying that I kept skipping ahead, hoping the story/character development would improve. Like a few of her other books that I have read recently, this just did not seem like it was written by Kirsten Osbourne.'
2	"I've enjoyed the other books in this series, they're easy reads that allow for some escapism without too much brain power, but this one was just boring and repetitive. It seemed like most of the book was spent rehashing the other books and I found myself skipping pages just to get to the new information. Just read another reviewer's synopsis instead of buying the book and hopefully the next one will be better."
2	'This book just dragged on and on with no real point. There was this unnecessary back and forth between both MC\'s and I was quite frankly bored of it all.\n\nI couldn\'t sense any kind of chemistry between Kieran and Thomas. It honestly felt like they chose each other so they wouldn\'t have to choose loneliness.\n\nThe world building also confused the eff out of me. I didn\'t read the first book so maybe that was the cause but I just couldn\'t picture a society where women could "father" children without any male intervention. How exactly do the mechanics of that work?\n\nAnother thing that fell flat for me was (minor spoiler) when Kieran gave birth he was told to push. Why was that even an option? All I could picture in my head was exactly where he was supposed to push the baby out of and that squicked me out. Common sense would dictate that a pregnant man would give birth via C-section (has the author never seen Junior with Arnold Schwarzenegger). I get that there are times where suspension of belief has to occur especially within this M-preg genre but I would have liked to see plausible situations where a pregnant man gives birth.\n\nI was disappointed and can\'t see myself reading another book by this author.'
2	"Couldn't get past the first few pages. Strained writing, clichd characters, faux angst. I like the genre, and the other books in the series seemed promising, but if this one is any indication, the author just cannot deliver. And I don't seem to be alone with this opinion."
2	"I have loved all the previous Lexi books, however, this one left me very dissatisfied.  You know who, why and how the antagonist is right from the very beginning.  The fact that lexi and friends don't figure it out until the end makes them look extremely inept, which is quite a disappointment from an author who is usually pretty clever.  Skip this one."
2	"The author presents Tesla's bio in a high school like fashion _ all facts and no synthesis. Indeed, he uses Tesla's story as model to advance his own theory of genius. This is not a biography, it is an encyclopedia entry. Tesla deserves much more."
2	'ARC provided by Netgalley in exchange for a honest review.\n\nAs a fan of Jen McLaughlin I was really looking forward to reading a stepbrother book from her. Unfortunately I was extremely disappointed. This book was beyond cliche. Their was absolutely no character growth or even any way to like the characters. Both were beyond annoying, naive, and self sacrificing to the point of absurdity. They were both immature and I never felt a connection between them.\n\nThis book took me along time to read as I kept getting annoyed I had to put it down. Hopefully the next book from this author will be better.'
2	"Pop-psych, not very well done. I'll pass."
2	'From the very first sentence, the author fails to capture the charm and spirit of the original series.\n\nIt takes considerably more than lifting catchphrases wholesale from the source material to create a sequel. I\'m not sure this author even read the source material--perhaps they just skimmed to find chunks of text to pull out of Benson\'s material? In other areas, an almost complete ignorance of the original books seems glaring. (What was the purpose in renaming Lucia\'s (formerly, Miss Mapp\'s) garden room? As the source of drama, heart-burnings, covert spying, romance, exposure, and innumerable hard-fought bridge games--it was practically a character in its own right and certainly deserved better treatment.)\n\nIn my opinion, the characters themselves are barely recognizable as the originals. If not for the author having lifted phrases and descriptions from  Benson\'s material, reusing them liberally, I don\'t know that I\'d have believed this was really meant to be Lucia\'s universe at all.\n\nThe only reason I gave this two stars instead of one is that "hate" is a pretty strong term. I did not like this. I removed it from my Kindle. I would never read it again. I\'m sorry I wasted 30 seconds and $0.99 purchasing it.'
2	"It was sort of entertaining until the end when clearly he couldn't figure out where he wanted to go, wrote a blow by blow on making a timer driven flare and then got even more bored and gave up."
2	'The heroine in this story was so wishy washy it was ridiculous.  This story could have been wrapped up in one book instead of four.'
2	'Writing about time travel is difficult. The author has to juggle the inherent paradoxes and the circular reasoning without losing the reader or destroying the reader\'s suspension of disbelief. While I applaud Margaret Millmore for trying her hand at this difficult genre, I regret to say that the resulting effort, The Dragonfly Door, was unsuccessful.\n\nThe plot was inviting; Frank Mann, living in 2013, is the only person who can use the dragonfly door to assist scientists in the future with an agricultural disease which, if left unchecked, will destroy all plant life on Earth. Unfortunately, Millmore chose to tell her story through multiple viewpoints and tenses: we first meet future scientist Clarisse in the third person, past tense; Frank relates his story in the first person, present tense; and we also look through the eyes of Selena, Dyse, and Hugo in rapid succession. By the end of the very short Chapter 6, I was already being asked to approach the plot from five different points of view; in addition, Millmore frequently changed tenses, sometimes within the same sentence. As a result, I was constantly thrown out of the story as I tried to figure out where the various characters\' chapters fit on the two time-lines. For a time travel story to work for me, it has to be a rollercoaster ride, where I am so anxious to see what happens next that I don\'t have time to stop and try to think through the logic (or lack thereof).\n\nMillmore made some other writing choices which irritated me and detracted from my immersion in the story. "Clarisse" was an unfortunate choice for the name of the first character introduced to the reader, as it immediately brought to mind Thomas Harris\'s The Silence of the Lambs. The Dragonfly Door did not benefit from the expectations this raised. Millmore also made frequent mistakes in word usage ("undisputable" for "indisputable"; "exasperated" for "exacerbated"; "commanded" for "demanded"), and I counted a whopping 47 instances of the phrase "sort of."\n\nIt appears from Millmore\'s author profile that The Dragonfly Door is the first of her books to be self-published, and lack of an editor could certainly explain some of the problems identified above. I will not be reading any more of her self-published work.\n\nI received a free copy of The Dragonfly Door from the author in exchange for an honest review.'
2	'The worst editing I have ever experienced: jumbled sentences with extraneous words/wierd symbols inserted in the sentences, making it hard to follow the subject matter.'
2	"The story line could've been great, but it wasn't executed properly.  The characters were poorly developed, and the sex scene was cheesy. I will not be reading the rest of this series."
2	'Just so so. Best to save your money and watch him on U-tube. He really does have some good information. I did not get any real insights from the e-book.'
2	"I just couldn't connect with the heroine, at all. I understand that she went through a lot but all the internalizing was driving me mad. I really had to push myself to even finish this book. Cade was possibly the only redeeming quality in this book. I can't go into what it is that I didn't like about this book without some serious spoilers, so I won't. Whether this review is helpful or not, it's how I feel. So happy it's over."
2	"Just ok - was an interesting story line but I think it wasn't fleshed out properly and the ending was flat."
2	'While this is not another book of stock pictures, I can not give this book a very high score.\nThere is no PDF link. But that\'s OK since the pictures look like they were drawn by a child. They are not suitable for adult coloring. The book has interesting facts within it & creative fairy names.\nI purchased this Kindle edition for $0.00 during a promotional period.\n No one has offered me any reward for my review - good or bad. My review, opinion and experience is 100% honest and genuine. I am in no way affiliated with the developer, manufacturer or distributor of this product.\nIf you found my review helpful, please vote "YES" and help me become a better reviewer!'
2	'Not well written and facts are distorted. I do historical research and a lot of the stuff in this book can not be documented. I did not finish reading it. Miight go back latter and finish after I stop laughing.'
2	"It had a really good story idea and I would have loved to have had it continue into a full fledged book . . . but it didn't."
2	"Um. I know lots of people love this one but I just couldn't get into it. I don't know it's just too dark for me or if  I just didn't connect with the characters. I didn't finish it."
2	'Underwater gargoyle  and a stranded diver. It was an interesting concept. However there was not enough development of the characters to make me care about them.'
2	'I loved the cover, the title and the idea of this book, but it really lacked depth and feeling. I think maybe if both characters told the story it may have helped.\n\nI think this author has potential and I hope to read another of her books soon .'
2	'This book had so much potential. The heroine acted like a spoiled child the entire time, never once acting like a strong Alpha female. SPOILER. During the "challenge" between Rick and Becca, we saw how weak she really was. The fight was over in seconds. The whole story felt rushed and there was never a clear picture. It was mere words on a page.'
2	"I paid the very reasonable 99 cents for this 4-book set; the rave reviews made me excited to get into this one since I love a good Amish read. Unfortunately, this one fell flat for me. Granted, I read only the first book, which comprised 42% of the total. I was tempted to give up halfway through, but persisted to the end of the first book, hoping things would get better. However, this was frankly a very boring read. The author is careful to TELL us just what everyone is feeling and thinking rather than depicting that through conversation and descriptive body language. The book races through the lives of Isaac and Rebecca as they fall in love, marry, and have children and then grandchildren. But while many years are covered, the plot actually plods along like a very tired Amish work horse. The author rarely takes us out of the house to experience life in an Amish community - I felt like I was a captive inside the four walls of their home. Additionally, the Kindle edition's editing is very lacking. You know what? There are MANY good authors who write about the Amish, so use your time wisely and check out books by Beverly Lewis, for example. You will learn much more about the Amish way of life as well as enjoy many entertaining and pleasurable hours of reading."
2	'Please do not let the 2 star review fool you.  Basically the premise of the story is outstanding in my eyes.  A Sci-Fi Fantasy that keeps you jumping.  And I mean just that!  From one dimension to another.  The story is based around Jason/Jaguar who is a human/animal/machine hybrid depending on which dimension he is in.  How cool is that right?  As Jaguar he is a descendant from a great and powerful warrior from the Animal Kingdom.  The tale is full of great battle scenes and dimension jumps with a little love story thrown in.  Highly entertaining.  Sometimes it seems like there were big gaps in the storyline and repeats.  But maybe it was just me.  I hope there is some sort of sequel because I would purchase it just to see how the story plays out.  I received this ebook free for an honest review.'
2	"unengaging.  Didn't enjoy the writing style - the  story would have been better to have finished at the end of the last book as nothing new happenend; therefore as these genres are predictable it was a waste of time."
2	'Not the traditional love story she usually writes.'
2	"This was a major disappointment in Kindle format because it's nearly impossible to find a specific breed easily. The content is also disappointing."
2	'Not much character development. Predictable, slow moving. I would not recommend this book. It needed more content and a better plot.'
2	'the book is just a piece of advice.....it is mainly the stuff we already know.....it gave me no motivation to loose weight. So basically a waste of time.'
2	'I am used to Christian fiction, so I can not be considered an entirely unbiased reader.  I was just glad I only paid $1 for the set.  These stories dealt with situations that I just could not enjoy.  I deleted it from my device after the second story.  I am sure these authors are very talented, but not writing from a Christian point of view.'
2	"I'm thankful that it was only $2, any more and I would have felt ripped off.  It's written like a mediocre fanfiction, and if it was original characters in an original setting outside Magic: the Gathering, I probably would have returned it for a refund immediately.\n\nIf it had been a bonus for buying a fat pack or something rather than being a stand alone novella, I'd probably enjoy it more."
2	'This was a rather dry account of the discovery of some lost letters written by Mary Todd Lincoln regarding her insanity case. There were some interesting background facts regarding  the emotional problems of the widow of Abraham Lincoln, which seemed to escalate at the time of his assassination. A peak into the Lincoln family and relationships with friends as well as family added to a rather boring description of just how these "lost letters" came to be found. Very short but seemed much longer.  Disappointing.'
2	"Very frustrating and confusing, but again the heroine ruined it for me with her annoying behavior because she was very, very spoiled, selfish, obstinate, nasty, rude, controlling, manipulative and stubborn, oh and let me not forget very cruel toward the gentle and sweet hero. I understand what she went through in the past, but she had no reason to take it out on such a sweet and gentle soul.  There were many inconsistencies and the whole book was written with modern dialouge, which frustrated me because this story was set in the tenth century.  My question is how and why was the heroine back in the villain' s village where she was raped, beaten and tortured in book one without being discovered by the guards and the villain?  Also, how could she suddenly have magic and be able to transform into a witch?  Also, she was 15 years of age in book one, but 18 in this book when only 1 1/2 years passed.  How could Wargo and his men have  been caught and imprisoned in the villain' s dungeon and not escape with their magic to avoid capture and injuries? Where did the witch Cirinda come from when she was not even mentioned in book one?  Why was the villain from book one not punished by the king for treason and his very serious crimes in book and permitted to return to Shrewsbury when in book one King Henry awarded the position of Cancellor and the keep to the hero in book one?  Also, why and when did the villain supposedly kill his older daughter, it was never mentioned, only that he killed her.  Why would he kill his only daughter only to try desperately to beget another heir, why did he kill his only daughter?  Why was Wargo in Shrewsberry?  These are the questions one who read book one would ask the author.  Well, I gave this book a two rating for the nice ending, which is all this book has to recommend it.  I find this book was everywhere and very difficult to follow, and left me with many unanswered question, like why had they said Sarah's child was a daughter when it was not, the author did not provide an reason.  It seems as if the author just wanted the reader to figure it out on your own, but it just left you confused until the end, which is not a good strategy for the reader because it frustrates the reader for for more than 305 pages, that is not suspenseful, it is mentally exhausting.  This author is very amateur and needs to sharpen her writing skills much more before her books can be considered worth reading.  This author's books may be ok for readers who have not read over 100 medeival romance books, but not for readers who are used to really getting a real for the era.  I would really not recommend this read!!!"
2	"This is not really a book. It's more like an article. The author has given some straight to the point instructions. I would have liked if the author would have personalized it with his own experience. Have you hired an outsourced writer to create this book?"
2	"At one point the detective is asleep on the murdered woman's bed. How exciting is that? Usually I enjoy older detectives but these guys are really slow moving. The repartee is funny for the first few chapters, then it gets old."
2	'o k for the first parts but gets very repetitive in the last part'
2	'I loved this book because it gave amazing details this was such a great book and I hope to read it again:-)'
2	'Three out of eight not bad. The rest a bit tedious.'
2	'i thought it was cute and funny but totally not worth 4 bucks. seriously who would pay that for a crappy story like this. this is a cute story for a crappy price.'
2	'Like reading a tech spec sheet on a microwave.\n\nOne of the most utterly boring, poorly written texts I have had the displeasure to have shackled to my neck for a course. This is very much a text in which the author too the time to stress their use of overly complex structure which is common in philosophy courses which only turns people away from what could be so very interesting.'
2	"President George Bush attended a grocers convention in 1992 and the New York Times erroneously wrote that Bush was amazed at the scanning technology. While this was clearly not the case, the inaccurate article led to criticism that Bush was out of touch with the average American.\n\nIn the just released Lights Out: A Cyberattack, A Nation Unprepared, Surviving the Aftermath, noted broadcast journalist Ted Koppel has written a book that makes him seem out of touch with the subject he is writing about.\n\nThe books premise is that a major and devastating cyberattack on Americas power grid is imminent. While its a disturbing hypothesis, never once does Koppel detail how such an attack would actually take place.\n\nThroughout the book, Koppel sets up his strawman and uses terms such as imagine, may, could and similar tenuous phrases. While these doomsday and worst-case scenarios are indeed terrifying, never does the book detail the specific how.\n\nThroughout the book, one is led to believe that the US electrical energy industry has not taken the cybersecurity threat seriously. While there are thousands of energy firms, I consulted for a year at one of the largest electricity firms in the northeastern US, and they took the threat seriously. While the mom and pop operators may not have a competent information security team, the large providers do take the threat seriously. Thats not to say they cant do a better job. But Koppel leads the reader to believe too many of the firms are asleep at the wheel.\n\nWhile Koppel may overplay the threat, there are things he does get right in the book, especially when he sticks to the facts. While electricity is critical to everyone, most people are clueless to how the power grid works and he does a good job of scoping that out. He notes that FEMA is woefully unprepared should such a scenario arise within the electric industry. Even for those scenarios that are not as disastrous; FEMA, state, and local governments have not created adequate disaster recovery plans.\n\nIn an interview with Jeh Johnson, Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, of which FEMA is a sub-agency, the normally hard-hitting Koppel deals with Johnson with kid-gloves. Johnson comes across somewhat clueless of the energy sector cyberthreat, to which Koppel notes that while Johnsons answer to Koppels question lasted 13 minutes; he never addressed the question, and it was an area in which Johnson conceded that he had little expertise.\n\nThe book then spends a few chapters on the Mormon Church, whose doctrines include planning for cataclysmic events. The book contrasts the somewhat bumbling approach to emergency preparedness that FEMA has had, to the highly effective plans the Church has tested and implemented.\n\nAs to being out of touch with the subject hes writing about, Koppel writes that when the NSA was working on a supercomputer which could execute a quadrillion operations a second, the NSA staff endearingly labeled the feat a petaflop. Unbeknownst to Koppel, a petaflop is a measure of computers processing speed and not an endearing descriptor. In this case a quadrillion operations per second.\n\nKoppel also writes as a matter of fact that the Sony hack was perpetrated by North Korea. While there hasn't been definitive attribution, it likely it was an insider attack.\n\nKoppel admits that he is not proficient in the complicated energy sector. To help him navigate through the arcane world of grid reliance standards and the evolving relationship between power industry groups and federal regulators, Koppel engaged the services of Dr. Ryan Ellis of the Cyber Security Project at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard University. Koppel notes that he sent transcripts of key interviews and rough drafts of relevant chapters to Dr. Ellis for his review and comments. Incredulously and disconcertingly, Koppel states that he didn't always follow the advice of Dr. Ellis.\n\nThe book makes it seems like the power grid is the only part of the critical infrastructure that is at risk. The book glosses over other sectors as water, gas, dams and much more without a mention.\n\nKoppel tells a great story and the book contains numerous interesting anecdotes about different characters from American history. Yet Koppel never deals with the core information security issues. He never details how an attack would play out, what systems would be infected, etc. Aside from mentioning SCADA, he never details how they are used or how they could be compromised.\n\nKopple writes how he spent a few days in Salt Lake City meeting with very senior leaders of the Mormon Church. He lets the reader know that the Mormons have almost 200 years worth of experience of dealing with disasters, as opposed to 37 for FEMA.\n\nWhat Koppel did is speak to a lot of very senior people and put what he gleaned into writing. Whats conspicuously missing is his speaking to any cybersecurity expert with experience in SCADA, malware or related areas. Information security journalist Taylor Armerding asked Koppel if he interviewed penetration testers who have experience in the electric generation and transmission sector. Incredulously, he said no. I don't think Koppel understands the significance of that exclusion; and therein lays the fundamental problem with this book."
2	"In all fairness this appears to be book 7 in a series of books and I haven't read any others in the series. I have been unable to enjoy the book long enough to finish it. The characters are annoying, and from the description I think the characters should be old enough to not be so namby pamby in their handling of those that annoy them. Michelle also writes paranormal and fantasy books, which I haven't as yet read any of but will at some stage give a try."
2	"I had looked forward to this book so much and I was so disappointed. It was incredibly slow moving which puzzled me until I realized that these were a bunch of college lectures hobbled together. She went on and on about food but after reading Julia Child's book the descriptions were flat not exciting. If you want to read someone who appreciates food, read Child not Mayes. I really couldn't stand how she mocked other tourists because, believe it or not, Ms. Mayes you too are a tourist. If I was that cruise company, I'd send her a bill. She also seems to have a major problem with overweight people. It was a catty, boring book. I wished I had read the reviews before I bought it."
2	'Disappointing. A couple of good ideas and a lot of hot air.'
2	"This is the first book I've read in this series and I don't think I'll be reading any more.  The main character is silly and living in a fairyland of her own making.  The whole thing is very contrived."
2	"Don't bother with this one if you have any interest in how it ends.  It starts out well enough, but the characters seem to develop multiple personality disorders or something as they go along.  And, I still haven't figured out how one gunman with one gun, holding hostage three other people, managed to shoot three of the four, including himself.  Pretty good start, but stupid denouement."
2	'Completely predictable and therefore boring.  There was no depth to the characters, and although there were allusions to the high school days where Charlie and Tricia had their discretion, it would have been nice to have explored his journey in more detail regarding how he dealt with being a single dad and the anger and bitterness he likely would have felt.  It seemed the plot was lifted from The Princess Diaries 2 and Sleepless in Seattle - spoiler alert - life is hard, it seems like it\'s not going to work out, God is good, and yay - everyone gets exactly what they wanted.  Further, in the acknowledgements the author thanked her editors, but someone needs to get them either a dictionary or glasses, as there were several typographical errors and misused words, one of the more noticeable being "site seeing" instead of "sightseeing."  As a reader familiar with the Springfield, Missouri area where the book is set, I recognized the local references made, but they added nothing to the story and I would think would be distracting if one didn\'t understand the unwritten back story.  As an example, why is it necessary to explain that the frozen custard ordered was created by and named for a local radio celebrity? I\'ve enjoyed Andy\'s Frozen Custard and the Woody P. Snowmonster myself, but it felt like the author was merely trying to reach her word quota.  I downloaded the book because it was free and by a local author, but will pass on her other books.'
2	"Altough the first of its kind, I was fairly disappointed w/ this game. Way too simplistic. Way too easy. And I've seen better graphics in the games where you at least need to manipulate objects. Add to that  the game is over in no time!"

2	"The Society Groom by Mary Lyons\nHarlequin Presents # 2066 - November 1999\nSociety Weddings themed series\n\nSeeing to the tiniest of details at the Church, wedding planner Olivia Johnson is horrified to see that the substitute best-man is none other than Dominic FitzCharles, the man who broke her tender naive 18 year old heart ten years before. When Dominic approaches Olivia at the reception, he's taken by surprise by her cold and bitter response. But there's not doubt to either of them that the attraction is just as strong as it ever was. So Dominic pursues her, and once they clear the air of what happened in the past, he sets out to seduce and marry her.\n\nAlthough the chemistry between Dominic and Olivia is strong, this story lacks the intensity that I've come to love about the Presents line. This is a love story more suited for Romance or possibly Desire. Once the truth of the past comes out, there really is no conflict or spark left to the courtship, and from there on the story is rather flat."

2	'Pretty predictable. Main character became annoying with how she thought everyone was doubting her abilities. Also pretty incredulous how she jumped to the top of the department within a month.'
2	"It wasn't what I expected. Very theoretical but lacked practice"
2	"This book really needs a proof reader to have read it ... so many mistakes!!  Story quite predictable!  Again read in about 3 hours!\nLight reading ... don't need to use your brain very much!"
2	"Doesn't give other options and doesn't go into optics at all. I like a bipod on my .308 also no laser options"
2	'So, apparently, if you act like a spoiled brat, stomp your feet, think everyone is against you, throw a tantrum, roll your eyes so much it gave ME a headache....then ending up getting the man of your dreams... Oh, GAG! Kill. Me. Now.\n\nTheir story is weak! The characters have no connection other than being sexually attracted to each other. Which, I don\'t have any idea why Dante would want someone like that.\n\nSeriously, come on! Get rid of the, Totes, Obvi, OMG\'s high school writing. That\'s not how a real writter writes or portrays a high school character. Clean out the unwanted scenes with the friends and junk that don\'t have anything to do with the story and just waste time.\n\nSkye acted like a complete brat. How could someone fall in love with that? I was really enjoying this story at the beginning. It was funny, up beat, and Dante was freaking HOT! But then, Dante brought Phoebe over for the first time and we finally got a glimpse of the real Skye. A jealous thirteen year old girl who doesn\'t get her way. That\'s when I started rolling MY eyes and was getting annoyed at everything that poured out of that little girls mouth. The innocent little girl.\n\nShe played dumb. She didn\'t take anything seriously.\n\nI stopped reading at 59% because I couldn\'t take the fact that the characters said, " I love you" after having mind blowing sex for the first time. Way to ruin a story when the connection wasn\'t there. Not for me anyways.\n\nWon\'t be reading anything more by this author.'
2	"I didn't finish this book.  Just not too interesting."
2	"Just as in the first book, the spelling, punctuation and misuse of words abounds. The story was okay, kind of cheesy.  I did find out that the heroes turn into wolves as well as beasts. However, I hate when authors have inconsistencies. In the first book, the hero was 400 years old. Now he's 300. The heroine had 18 brothers & sisters, now she has 14. If I can remember these details, surely the author should be able to as well."
2	'Poor translation, unimpressive. Find another edition.\nI have read both verse and prose versions, and this prose version was very disappointing.'
2	"Not really my type of story.  I could not settle into the storyline and just skipped to the end and I don't think I missed much...bleh.."
2	"Not impressed.  The cards are so small it gets hard to play for too long.  Also not sure if I am missing a trick/tip but once all cards are in order they don't automatically go up in the pile you have to manually drag each card up."
2	'not much content there at all. way too simple and brief for anyone who has experience with the Bible or study'
2	"This is a good clean romantic comedy. It wasn't what I thought it would be, though. I was so bored I finally gave it up. I am sure that there are others who would really like it, but I didn't."
2	'this read was torture to get thru'
2	'I really wanted to like this book, I really did.  The concept of the book is fantastic.  The idea of being able to telepathically communicate with your soulmate and have a deeper connection is what people strive for in any type of relationship.  The execution of the idea, however, fell short for me.\n\nThe book starts off relatively well with the author taking time to develop the story, but at some point she falters and does a complete rush job.  The mantra for any good writer is, "Don\'t tell, show," but that didn\'t happen here.  I don\'t want to give too much away, but an example of what I\'m talking about would be at the wedding.  The author tells us that Shay and Lynn say their vows to each other, they cry (which they do FAR TOO MUCH in this book), and they go back to the hotel.  If the author really wanted us to invest in these characters, she would allow us in and let us feel what they are feeling through the words.  What the hell were these vows that Lynn so lovingly and painstakingly wrote soon after they met?  What happened to Shay when Lynn was away at the end?  It is the lack of details that makes the book fall short, especially when the climax is rushed through like an afterthought.\n\nAnother thing for the author to consider besides trying to be more descriptive is to make sure she\'s paying attention to the little things.  I\'m sure she didn\'t write this overnight, but some of us will read this book in a day or two, so it\'s easy for us to get distracted by how many times \'purple\' is mentioned as another viewer stated.  My issue wasn\'t with purple, but how much these chicks were crying in the novel.  Really?  Who has that many tears to spare in a lifetime?  Too much crying.  They cried during sex, they cried when it\'s time to say goodbye, they cried when they were joyous, etc.  You get the picture.\n\nI\'ve seen from comments left on other reviews that the author is paying attention, so my hope is that you find this criticism in the vein in which it was written-as a means to help you improve your craft.  This truly could have been a great story if not for the focus on materialism, the lack of detail, and the rush job that was done on this.  I\'m giving this two stars because the concept is one that could have taken this book over the top but the execution just was not there.'
2	"Interesting story line. But needs to be more fleshed out. It is definitely lacking something. The beginning was semi ok, but way to descriptive in the mundane details and too flowery in the important details. The middle and end was very rushed together and seemed like the author was just trying to finish the story, not tell the characters' story."
2	'Did not like the beginning of the book. The story was a better as you read it. Did not really like this book. Did not like the way the story was written.'
2	"I didn't care for the characters or their motivations. It seemed the story was too short for a reader to start caring for the characters."
2	"An easy read, some good information, but not what I was expecting. Don't bother unless you are a beginner- very basic."
2	'There was something missing from this book. For an alpha, Jake was a little vanilla.  Lauren was a little fickle. I hope the other books are better. However, I am hesitate to try them.'
2	'Found story too brief and the ending was too abstract - ending needed details of exactly how the brother-in-law was killed prior to beng sliced up in the deli slicer.'
2	"I loved David Levithan's novel Every Day about a teenage entity who wakes up each morning in a different body, but this prequel just didn't do it for me. I think the intent was to showcase how A adopted their principles and grew to be the kind of person who would fall for Rhiannon at the start of Every Day, but there's not really a huge disconnect between the characterization here and there, and I didn't feel like I learned anything new about A's character in this story. Read Every Day and consider the companion novel Another Day, but don't bother with this one."
2	"Although I agree strongly with the concepts presented in this book, I just couldn't stomach the poor writing. Was it translated from another language?  The sentence structure or lack thereof made me want eat a cookie from emotional distress.  I'm going to request a refund of this free book."
2	"I only read this book because once I start a series I can't stop!! I always feel as if the next one has to be better! Once again, I was wrong! This series is poorly written & doses not flow!"
2	"Under His Skin, Stacey O'Neale\n\nReview from Jeannie Zelos book reviews\n\nGenre: Romance,Sci-fi and Fantasy\n\nIts rare for me to not get on with an Entangled covet but this book and I just didn't gel :( The book was fine, the story adequate and I can see others love it but for me it was a fail.\nI just found the whole plot about the brothers too unreal, and even in fantasy I have to feel that if Supernaturals were real the story could be credible. I didn't though found the brothers weird, and Kaden blowing hot and cold, trying to find ways out even when his history says hes in a life match so to speak. The FBI connection too I just couldn't believe in it, theres no way three unknowns would get treated that way... Then theres Annabelle, shes a sweet girl but I found it hard to see or feel anything real between her and Kaden,just a surface attraction. I felt the romance was a bit rose tinted specs type where it was her dreams about him, more than Kaden himself that she was in love with.\nJust too light and fluffy for me, a chocolate mousse dessert rather than a rich, flavourful, dense Sachertorte....\nI skim read from about halfway through as I just couldn't get along with this book.\nStars: Sadly just two, a decent book others will love Im sure but for me it just didn't work. Everyone likes different reads, and this was a bad choice on my part. \nARC supplied by Netgalley and publishers.\nIf you enjoyed my review I'd love it if you would please click Like and if you didn't I'd love to know why, in case I've inadvertently added a spoiler and need to edit."
2	"I like a good short shot of erotica every once in a while. You know the kind, a non complicated straight forward, down and dirty little gem of a story. Well this had all of those elements down to the letter, however, there seemed to be a disconnect. The characters are friends. That to me makes the story even better. BUT, one is a jock and the other a buff scholar. The jock is in need of a friend and turns to Blaine. Well, from there, things explode (no pun intended). The jock (Craig) in this story doesn't seem the type to be so super easy. In college, a jock, fresh from a hetero relationship, never even looked twice at a guy, and he is gong to all of a sudden be the aggressor to a gay for you night? It doesn't fit. And it messes up the flow between the two. What could have been a crazy good erotic short, just seems like a forced fake story. If Blaine had been the aggressor and Craig had put up a bit of resistance to the act. That would have been much more believable. There are hints in the beginning and throughout the two having conversation, that lets us know Blaine is gay and feeling his friend, but has never done anything about it. Well, they both proceed to get trashed, pass out on the couch together and then Craig wakes up, looks at Blaine and then starts kissing him...? WTF? That just doesn't make sense. Anyhow, that is the reason this story only got two stars. It was unbelievable, and not in the OMG way. I will say this, the sex is awesome. The chemistry is of the charts. And they make the pages steam. So the actual physical stuff isn't the problem. I will in fact read more from this author, because I see great potential.\nSo, do I recommend this book? No. Do I recommend this author? YES!"
2	"I normally give 4 or 5 stars to Mia Caldwell's books, but this one had my thought train and emotions all over the place. The point of views from some many characters was beyond irritating. For once, I found myself speed reading past the annoying parts to get to main 2 characters. Normally, I like to savor the words and engage in the emotions. It took me 3 attempts to push through and read it. The development of the bitch eat bitch business world could have been accomplished through the discovery of the traitorous deeds. Julio having sex with Will was against character when he already said that he does not like to take competent women over the business boundaries. However convoluted the story became; the ending was satisfying."
2	'This book is much too tehnical for strict entertainment.  I flew the back seat of the USAF Phantom and was looking for some entertaining reading about a much loved bird.  I thought I was reading the "dash one" (pilot\'s handbook) on the English version.  This book is only entertaining to test pilots with a masters degree in aeronautical engineering.'
2	'I know it\'s just an episode, and not a full volume, but it\'s not very satisfying. It goes from a dangerous situation to a somewhat boring date. And while it promises perversion, it fails to deliver. The "sex scene" was just a far off view when you expect more from how the foreplay started.'
2	'Just a five star romance that any reader will enjoy it is clever and the characters are delightful. I know it will be enjoyed by many readers@'
2	'This started off well but midway into the story, it was twist after twist. And what about the fianc who supposedly "murdered" Max? Was he a part of the plan? Is he still in jail? They never say. This story could have been a lot better.'
2	'If you read the 3 previous 50 Shades of Grey books, there are no surprises here. Save your $$.'
2	'There is something strange about Dnevnik for Kindle, I only get back issues. It is 20.07 today, and the last issue I received is dated 18.07. Fortunately the two week trial is free, and I am about to cancel it.'
2	"I thought this was going to be a really good variation, but it just went off on the wrong road as far as I'm concerned and lacked some of the better elements of the authors other variations."
2	"I'm a pretty prolific reader and always on the lookout for a new author so when this book came up as a freebie, I leapt at the chance to try her writing out. The author's books seem to sell for around $5 a book so I wasn't prepared to spend that kind of money without being sure.\n\nSo after reading this novella, my final thoughts are that clearly the author can write but she seems to believe in the credo that 'sex sells' and her books  clearly have lots of sexual content. I, on the other hand, read way too many books and there are a finite number of ways to say the same thing about sex and so I look for story content more.\n\nI thank the author for the opportunity of trying her book but I believe I'm going to pass on the series."
2	'Cases were likely hard to research'
2	'The premise of this book is quite good, but poor prose. The same sentences, in variation are used again and again. Writer, get a thesaurus if words fail you.'
2	"With the comment about Einstein's schooling being an out and out lie, the rest of the book was less believable, but it was so short and otherwise useful information..."
2	'I liked the gist behind The story and all but I really hated how it all skip to when Lyra is pregnant!!!! It left me going WHAT JUST HAPPEN !!!!!!!! That not really my style sloop It was a little weird to me...'
2	"I wish it had a few checklists! Also wasn't too deep or specific. Good if you had no clue what you are doing."
2	"The book description caught me, so I bought it immediately. For free?? Why not? There are so many things I didn't like about this story (I make 50K a year, what about you?), but don't have the time to list them. I will say that it sometimes read as though it was written by someone for whom English is a second language. Quick read? Yes. Worth the time? No."
2	"I was looking for a straight forward book about succeeding in business. Perhaps I missed the fact that this was more of a motivational book. I have a hard time when I'm expecting cut and dry directives - but instead get things like the definition of success! A lot of reflecting back, just seemed to be a lot of filler."
2	"I got a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. I give it a 2 Stars. I struggled to finish this book. While the idea of 2 broken young adults found love is a good one, it was not original. I found that Penney's low self-esteem issue really dragged out. This was going on and on all through the book. It was nice to see that she finally got help and dealt with this issue but by the time she did this, the story ended. I would be nice to see how Penney and Lucas make out once they got together. Also, it drove me crazy that there were many grammar errors that could have been easily avoided by proofreading instead of using grammar check or spell check."
2	'some words deleted no coherance'
2	"This story was a little confusing. The two story lines did not flow too well together and it was confusing...who was supposed to be in love with who? Who broke who's heart? I just didn't get it. :/"
2	'This is a collection that mixes the author\'s own spooky experiences with short stories that draw on these personal moments of fright.  While it\'s always of some interest to me to read people\'s accounts of their "paranormal activity," I have to say the fiction left me wanting.  If you enjoy the Hanz Holzer type of haunting books, you might enjoy this.'
2	"Didn't bother to read past page 53. Just didn't like the story, plot or narrative style."
2	'Did not hold my interest\nJust not complete left me wondering\nAlways the same next book in series  Just to sell more'
2	"The story seemed to be written in blocks and those blocks didn't fit together.  I did not enjoy at all."
2	"The book was way to small to cover this topic and what it did cover it didn't do that well either."
2	"This is a story about Alice. She is infatuated with Theo. She asks the sexy bad boy Ranik to teach her how to attract Theo since she has no experience with boys & dating. He agrees to help her out, and he's very gracious about it. She on the other hand comes off totally bitchy and mean. She yells at him all the time and belittles him. I just didn't like her! I didn't understand how he could fall for her. She does of course come around towards the end, but by then I had already decided I didn't like her, so I didn't care at that point if they ended up together or not. Plus for most of the book she likes or thinks she likes the other guy, so not really much romance between her and Ranik. This was disappointing because I loved the Vicious series, and adored those characters, and was hoping for something just as fabulous, but sadly that was just not the case."
2	'This "book" describes how to get nearly free travel at a Comfort Suites near the Atlantis, which is fair, but there are a bunch of blogs that highlight this exact process more generally. If you\'ve run across this book, you\'re probably familiar with these blogs so this book adds nothing to the discussion. Simply identifying which credit card offers will help get you to this particular location is not worthy of a book, even if it\'s free. In addition, as another reviewer noted, the credit card offers the author suggests we sign up for are fluid and may have expired.'
2	"I said everything that bothered me in the first book's review.  I'll not be buying any further books in this series."
2	'I enjoyed reading the first book in this series, but this book was kind of a disappointment. I found it did not have much age play in it. It seemed that Mr. Elliott was more concerned about pushing for things done on his time frame then allowing little Gia to be trained as the other girls.'
2	'Not a lot of plot. Simple, poorly developed characters. Unrealistic assumptions about the lack of cultural changes in 200 millennia!'
2	'This "book" is nothing more than a 2 page pamphlet. As if this was not enough of an insult , the format is so small it is hardly readable. Do not waste your money.'
2	'I am really disappointed with all of the high ratings of this story. I found the characters to be extremely juvenile and unbelievable. Much more research should go into writing a story for publication. No way do lawyers or paralegals have that much free time, and if they did blow off work that much his eight (really!?!) cars and ridiculously over the top McMansion (how old is this guy?) would have been repossessed at some point during this story.\n\nDo not even get me started on the grammar, punctuation or word usage. I would definitely demand my money back from the editor and insist that he tear up any diploma that required a passing grade for English 101.\n\nThat being said, I think that there must be some potential here. I did finish the book and am a little curious to see how the roommate story develops. I just hope th author develops the conflict on more than some superficial tattoo prejudice.'
2	'Did not like this one.  There were a number of passages that implied some things that I was not comfortable reading.  No more of this writer for me.'
2	"Nice story, just a bit surprised it didn't have any vampires or other mystical beings in  it.."
2	'How can an incomplete work possibly be available for sale?  I gave it two stars simply because it is written from the perspective of a hearie (the author) who is married to a deaf person and what was written left me wanting more...'
2	'THIS BOOK JUST DID NOT INTEREST ME I AM NOT INTERESTED IN THIS SUBJECT MATTER NOR AM I SINGLE.  SORRY!!'
2	'This series dissapointed me. They were on the best sellers list so I took a chance.  At 99 cents a piece it was not a larege investment but...I could have saved the 2.97.....and skipped them.'
2	"I really wanted to like this book and I was hoping it would be better than the first book. However I found it's constantly repeated quotes extremely annoying. I had to force myself to finish the book. I don't need to be told 1 trillion times that Kris wants a husband. Or that we should live for today 10 billion times. It felt like groundhog day."
2	"I was underwhelmed by this book, and while I have mentioned in the past that I think some authors need to get a dictionary and a thesaurus, I think this one went over board with the thesaurus. I am still trying to figure out how chocolate can taste distinguished.\n\nI was completely put off by the illogical leaps in emotion that the heroine makes towards the end of the book and though I could predict the end, I didn't want to go along for the ride with this book unlike others that are also predictable. I lost interest in any of the characters and just closed the file and deleted it from my kindle."
2	"slow moving, just sort of didn't enjoy it much"
2	'The story is mostly boring, predictable. Characters seem to pop out of a cookie cutter program. I had to put it down more than once, finishing was an exercise'
2	"Just managed to finish reading it.  Skimmed the last 30 to 40 pages.  I'm disappointed as the story started well then just ended up with pages of nothing but sex"
2	'Before reading this story I knew Fredric Brown only from his SciFi. I feel the noir format did not leand fertile ground for his dark sense of humor. Still I enjoyed the read.\n\nFrank'
2	"I'm not sure what it is about this series but it just didn't work out for me.. This was another one that I skimmed and just couldn't get into ."
2	"I don't fancy that much this kind of stories, but they are easy to read and easy to forget. The layout of Harlequin Kindle is rather annoying."
